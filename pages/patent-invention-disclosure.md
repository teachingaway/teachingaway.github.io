Invention Disclosure is the first step of the patent application process. The inventor describes her new technology in thorough detail. The patent attorney will discuss this disclosure with the inventor, make notes, and then use the disclosure to build the patent application's "specification."  At this stage, it's often helpful to describe the invention invention in terms of the **problem** and the **solution**. Describe the problem the invention solves, and then carefully describe the details of how the invention solves this problem. 

This "invention disclosure form" is intended to help you organize the details of your new technology. Use your time efficiently. Not every question is relevant to every invention. If something seems irrelevant, leave it blank on the first pass.

# Brief Description of the Technology

In a page or less, describe what the technology does. What is the existing problem? How does the new technology solve it? How will you bring the technology to market? 

- - - 

# Detailed Description 

Describe the new technology in detail, and carefully highlight any portions that are different from existing technology in the field. Describe all of the important parts, and how all the parts inter-operate and work together. The following questions should help you think about your technology, but are not mandatory. 

- - - 

## Problem and Solution 

- What problem does your new technology solve? 
- How have *other people* tried to solve this problem in the past?
- How does *your invention* solve this problem? 
- How else might competitors try to solve this problem in the future? 
- What were your biggest *technical challenges* in solving the problem? 
- Are there other ways to solve the problem? 
- In what ways is your invention superior to the previous methods of solving the problem? 

## Components and Connections 

- What component parts make up the invention? 
- What component parts, if any, are new? Why couldn’t you use a standard component? 
- Which components took longest to develop?  Why? 

- How are the component parts *connected*?  
- How do the component parts work together? 
- Are any of the connections new or nonstandard? Which connections? 
- Why couldn't you use standard connections?

## Drawings

**Physical Products**. If you are providing drawings for the application, please provide drawings: 

- Showing the *final* assembled product. Include front, back and side views if necessary. 
- An *exploded view* showing how the major components connect. 
- Some detailed views of the most important *components*, and detailed views of any important *interactions* between components. 

 
**Flow Charts**. Whenever a multi-step process is involved, flow charts will be helpful.

## Alternative Embodiments

Are there other ways to achieve the same goals? Please describe these alternatives as well, even if you decided not to pursue them for the commercial product or service.

# Level of Detail

The patent application should read like an instruction manual for making and using the new technology. This instruction manual does not need to explain the field of technology from the ground up.  It should be written for a person of “ordinary skill” in the relevant field of technology (in patent jargon, the “Person Having Ordinary Skill In The Art” or “PHOSITA”). 

This "person of ordinary skill" you are writing for is like a reasonably competent scientist or a proficient engineer. They are generally familiar with the relevant technology, but not necessarily a genius or an expert. They will be familiar with standard components and will-known techniques used in the field. 

A patent specification need not disclose or teach aspects of the technology that are already well known in the field:  

 > It is well-established that the hallmark of written description is disclosure. The level of detail required to satisfy the written description requirement depends, in large part, on the nature of the claims and the complexity of the technology. ... the written description requirement "does not demand either examples or an actual reduction to practice; a constructive reduction to practice that in a definite way identifies the claimed invention can satisfy the written description requirement." That said, a mere wish or plan to obtain the claimed invention is not sufficient. [*Streck, Inc. v. Research & Diagnostic Sys., Inc.*, 665 F.3d 1269 (Fed. Cir. 2012)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7422763321181224083)(internal citations and punctuation omitted).

## Inventorship

Be sure to list all of the "inventors." Inventors includes anyone who has helped to "conceive" the invention.  [MPEP 2137.01(II)](/mpep/s2137.html#d0e206713). This does not include team members who merely follow instructions from an inventor.  


## Ownership 

Who will own the patent? Have any of your employees or independent contractors worked on the invention? Do you have an "invention assignment agreement" in place? If so, please provide a copy.
