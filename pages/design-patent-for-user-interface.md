Design patents for digital user interface designs are often a compelling addition to an intellectual property portfolio. Solving complicated UI problems creates real value. 

Designers can either (a) donate this solution to the public domain, (b) lock it up in patents and copyrights, or (c) protect it at some intermediate level–*some rights reserved*. Lets start with public domain and the Creative Commons (some rights reserved), then scroll on over to design patents. 

**Public Domain**. Not every UI design is eligible for a patent, and not every *eligible* design *needs* to be patented. Most UI elements and patterns are already in the public domain, and new UI designs can be donated to the community. 

Public domain is easy, but its not automatic. To ensure a design is dedicated to the public, a designer should announce her intention with a Creative Commons "[CC0](http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0)" notice, or label it “no rights reserved” or “public domain.” That should do the trick. 

**Creative Commons**. If full-blown public domain is a little too free, Creative Commons offers some handy [standardized licenses.  ](http://creativecommons.org/choose/)CC licenses are generally free-as-in-beer, but generally *not* free-as-in-speech. The various CC options help designers retain rights to their work, while also encouraging other folks to use and sometimes build on the original design. For example, you can let people use it at no cost for non-commercial purposes, but charge them a fee if they want to use your design in business. Or you can let people use your design at no cost, but only if they give you credit and a link. 

## Responsible Use / Twitter IPA. 

Patent trolls can be a serious problem, particularly in the software world. These patent problems tend to arise when designers and inventors lose control of their patents, and the patents eventually fall into the clutches of trolls. Some simple legal tools, like Twitter’s Innovator’s Patent Agreement, can prevent trolls from abusing  patents. Twitter’s [IPA](https://blog.twitter.com/2012/introducing-innovators-patent-agreement) prohibits weaponizing patents without the inventors consent, and the [Defensive Patent License](http://defensivepatentlicense.drupalgardens.com/) prohibits offensive patent litigation against anyone who decides to join the DPL pool.

Twitter’s IPA is like the security systems installed in early [nuclear weapons](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/01/strangelove-for-real.html). "If the United States went to war, two people would be necessary to unlock a nuclear weapon, each of them provided with half the code." With the IPA, two people are required to launch a patent lawsuit: the owner and the inventor. This is a critical safety mechanism because inventors are rarely interested in filing frivolous lawsuits. In fact, most frivolous lawsuits seem to come from small patent-assertion companies that buy up patents several years after they’re issued. 

This post has 3 parts. First, we discuss the basics of **design patent law** and how design patents differ from utility patents, copyright and trademarks. Second, we give some **examples** of how technology companies use design patents to protect user interface elements like layouts, transitions, controls, and typography.  Finally, we discuss how technology startups can use design patents to build robust intellectual property **portfolios**. 

# Law of Design Patents

Design patents protect the *appearance* of a design, and the protection lasts for *15 years*. They are relatively inexpensive, easy to enforce, and infringement can result in monetary penalties.  

**Application Process**. Design patents take about a year from application to issuance (compare to 3-5 years for a utility patent). Budget about $3-4,000 in total costs for a typical UI design patent (a utility patent is more expensive, maybe $8-20,000). 

**Somewhat Non-Functional. **Where utility patents protection functional inventions, design patents protect non-functional inventions. Or at least mostly-non-functional inventions. The Design Patent Statute limits protection to the "ornamental" design of a product. But courts interpret “*ornamental*” to really mean “*non-functional.”* Other courts have further interpreted “non-functional designs” to mean something like any design that is not entirely dictated by function. In practice, most UI elements are eligible for design patent protection, even if the designs are partly functional. 

A design will only be non-patentable if its overall appearance is "dictated by function." That is, if the design is governed *solely* by the product’s function, the design cannot be patented. On the other hand, if alternative designs are available for performing the same function, the design is [not dictated ](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5349194340358969962)solely by its function, and it can be patented.

* The patent statute says design patents are available to protect the "[ornamental design for an article of manufacture](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/171)."
* which really means design patents protect "non-functional designs"
* which really means that design patents protect anything except designs solely "dictated by function."  

**Easy Litigation**. Design patents are easy to enforce. The legal issues simply involve comparing the plaintiff’s design patent drawings to the defendant’s product. It doesn’t take an expensive team of experts to detect infringement or bring a case to trial. (NOTE:  Although expensive experts are often used in high-stakes design patent litigation, they are not necessarily required. And of course, lawyers are still expensive. ) A judge or jury can simply compare the pictures in the plaintiff’s design patent to the defendant’s product.

**Infringement**. A design patent is infringed if "an ordinary observer, familiar with the prior art designs, would be deceived into believing that the accused product is the same as the patented design." *[Richardson v. Stanley Works*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4065677538492368378). 

**Prior Art**. Prior art is relevant to this comparison. The differences between the claimed design and the allegedly infringing design "are viewed in light of the prior art." Since the ordinary observer is viewing the designs in light of the prior art, her attention will be “drawn to those aspects of the claimed design that differ from the prior art.”  *[Crocs v. Int’l Trade Commission*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8466727333574506240). 

The closer the plaintiff’s design patent is to any prior art designs, the harder it is to show the defendant’s product is infringing. Where the prior art is similar to the design patent, even small differences between the design patent and the defendant’s design become important. "The ordinary observer, however, will likely attach importance to those differences depending on the overall effect of those differences on the design." *[Crocs v. Int’l Trade Commission*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8466727333574506240). 

In litigation, defendants frequently use prior art to reduce the potency of the plaintiff’s design patents. When Apple alleged that Samsung’s Galaxy tab infringed an iPad design patent, Samsung replied by digging up examples of prior art tablets. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ipad-v-galaxy-tab-fidler-design-patent-compare.jpg" class="translucent">  

Samsung was making a simple argument: the Galaxy tab doesn’t copy Apple’s ‘889 design patent, its just using public-domain design elements like the prior art like the  a rectangle with rounded corners found in the 1994 "Fiddler" tablet. 

**Infringement Consequences**. The penalties for *design* patent infringement are large, and often larger than the damages in a comparable *utility* patent case.  This is because design patent damages are not "apportioned." In utility patent cases, [damages](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/284) are awarded in proportion to the extent that the infringing feature drove the defendant’s profits. But for design patent infringement, there is no such reduction. Instead, the plaintiff is awarded the infringer’s “[total profit](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/289).”

The design patent owner may also be awarded an "injunction" – a court order forbidding the defendant from selling any products that use the plaintiff’s patented design.

## Design Patent Drawings

The drawings are the heart of a design patent. They define the design that is being protected.  The difference between solid lines and dashed lines in these drawings is critical. *Solid lines* identify the parts of the design that are actually protected by the patent. *Dashed lines* show context or environment.

Solid lines represent protected design elements, but the more solid lines in a drawing, the narrower the protection it affords. This is a counterintuitive concept and merits some explanation. More solid lines in a design patent drawing generates narrower protection because an infringing product must incorporate each element shown in solid lines, not just some of them. 

Compare the "patent" drawing in the upper left to the “product in the upper-right. The patent shows a square and a triangle in solid lines. Since the product doesn’t have a triangle, its not infringing the patent. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/solid-v-dashed-line-in-design-patent-example.png" class="translucent">    

Now look at the patent in the lower-left. It has a square drawn in solid lines, and a triangle in dashed lines. This time, we ignore the triangle. Since the product has the matching square element, its infringing the design patent. 

More dashed lines leads to stronger protection. A real-life example from *Apple v. Samsung *will help explain: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/iphone-v-samsung-lozenge-design-patent-compare.png" class="translucent">  

Apple’s D’087 patent uses *solid* lines to depict the shape of its microphone (a rounded-rectangle) but *dashed* lines for its circular home button. This means that the circular home button (dashed) is not considered in the infringement analysis. Samsung’s phones can’t avoid infringement by using a non-circular home button. 

The microphone in Apple’s patent is drawn in *solid* lines. So Samsung can only infringe if its product incorporates a microphone with the same rounded-rectangle shape. Samsung argued this point at trial, and highlighted the differences between the Samsung microphone shape and the Apple microphone shape. This would be a winning strategy for Samsung, if the shapes were actually different. The jury thought Samsung’s microphone was just another rounded-rectangle. Maybe if Samsung’s microphone was a pure rectangle it could have avoided design patent infringement. 

Apple’s D’087 patent could have been even stronger by showing the microphone in dashed lines. If the microphone was shown in dashed lines, a competitors phone would be infringing if it used the design shown in solid lines, regardless of what shape it used for its microphone or home button. In short, dashed lines make design patents stronger by making it easier to prove infringement.

# UI Design Patent Examples

Design patents can protect user interface icons, layouts, fonts, UI controls, transitions and a variety of  animations, swipes and gestures. Check out the examples below. I picked these images as teaching examples, not because they are particularly brilliant designs or even valid patents. They are just examples of how companies are using design patents to protect their UI. 

**Basics**. The Patent Office likes to call UI design patents "Generated Images" (short for computer-generated images).  The Patent Office also has a strange requirement that UI design patents need to be shown within a computer screen or some similar physical context. 

**Classification**. The Patent Office classifies patents by technology-type in a wonky, multi-tier taxonomy. UI design patents tend to fall within USPTO class [D14/486](http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/uspcd14/defsd14.htm#CD14S485000). Under the US patent classification system, D14/486 is defined to include: 

* **D14**: Recording, Communication or Information Retrieval Equipment

    * **D14/485 Generated Image**: Design for electronically produced symbol for computer that may be viewed on a computer screen.

        * **D14/486 Drop down menu or full screen menu type**: Design for image that fills the entire display area of a computer screen or within a strictly defined area therein. 

## UI Layouts

Design patents for UI layouts are among the more interesting and important type of UI design patents. A clunky UI makes selecting files, navigating menus and launching applications a frustrating chore. But innovative techniques, especially for tablet devices, can make these tasks easier. 

Adobe patented the layout of its iOS file selection system in [D’628](http://www.google.com/patents/USD691628). Note the use of dashed lines to depict the tablet: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/adobe-ios-selection-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

Facebook is more aggressive with its dashed lines. [D’621](http://www.google.com/patents/USD691622), Facebook’s recent "status update" UI design patent uses dashed lines for the computer monitor and all of the text. The solid lines– showing the patented portion of the Facebooks UI–are limited to a  few rectangles. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/facebook-status-update-ui-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

[Facebook goes even fur](http://www.google.com/patents/USD653671)ther for its [chat-box UI](http://www.google.com/patents/USD685384) design patents. In this patent, the only solid lines are for a small portion of the speech bubble, and for the box around the avatar’s face. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/facebook-chatbox-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

Facebook patented several other aspects of its [user](http://www.google.com/patents/USD671551) [interface](http://www.google.com/patents/USD653671)[ layout.](http://www.google.com/patents/USD653671)

Apple is famously aggressive in its pursuit of UI design patents. Apple’s  ‘[666](https://www.google.com/patents/USD668666) design patent protects UI with a bottom row of icons. Other than the 4 icons, everything else is drawn in dashed lines: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-design-patent-for-gui-with-4-icons-in-row.png" class="translucent">  

Apple’s [D’864](http://www.google.com/patents/usd660864) patent is similarly sparse. It protects a UI with a few rows of icons, in the proportions of iOS on an iPad.  

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-ipad-home-screen-design-patent.jpg" class="translucent">

**Google** has a design patent on its famously simple [landing page ](https://www.google.com/patents/USD599372)and search box ([discussed at Patently-O](http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2009/09/googles-patent-on-its-googlecom-home-page.html) blog). While the "Google" logo is shown in broken lines, much of the other text is shown in solid lines. It would be fairly easy to design a search page that looked like Google but did not infringe on this particular design patent. (NOTE:  Not that this is a good idea. )

<img src="/images/design-patent/google-search-box-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

<img src="/images/design-patent/google-search-box-gui-example.png" class="translucent">  


Google has also patented the layout of its search results, of Google Maps elements like its "[teardrop shaped marker icon](https://www.google.com/patents/USD621413)", and of Android design elements like its [chat bubbles](https://www.google.com/patents/USD685384). Google even a patent on the layout of [Google Patents](https://www.google.com/patents/USD591304).

## Animated UI Elements 

Design patents can protect animations and transitions as well as layouts. The way a layout adapts to a new context or to user input is often a key UI innovation. 

Apple’s [iBooks page turn](https://www.google.com/patents/USD670713) is an animated design patent shown in 3 positions. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-page-turn-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

[iOS Keyboard Animation](https://www.google.com/patents/USD621848) shows how a key gives user-feedback by way of an expanding bubble above the selected key.  

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-keyboard-animated-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

[iOS album swipe](http://www.google.com/patents/USD609715) animation shows 3 positions as well: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-cover-art-scroll-ui-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

[Swipe to Unlock](http://www.google.com/patents/USD675639). Some people found the swipe to unlock design patent too bland and obvious to merit patent protection. Setting aside these objections, Swipe-to-Unlock is a good example of how to use a design patent to claim an animated UI element. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-slide-to-unlock-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

Most of the design patent is dashed lines. This carefully defines the patent rights, and limits them to the solid-line "swipe bar." (because of the dashed lines, this patent protects against use of a similar swipe bar, regardless of what the rest of the OS looks like). 

Swipe to unlock also shows the UI feature in two different modes: ready (fig. 3) and activated (fig.4). Many other animated UI design patents can be claimed with a similar series of drawings.

## Controls, Icons, Typography. 

Autodesk’s [tour building wheel](http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2010/ENU/AutoCAD%202010%20User%20Documentation/index.html?url=WS73099cc142f48755-4607e7cc11b1cfff571794.htm,topicNumber=d0e28487) is a nice example of an arrangement of complicated controls. It uses different shapes and sizes to differentiate buttons. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/autodesk-tour-building-wheel-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

Facebook has a design patent on its two-silhouette "friend" icon. Notice that every detail except the icon is shown in dashed lines. This design patent only covers the icon. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/facebook-user-icon-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

**Fonts** can be patented. Adobe regularly secures design patents for its fonts.

## Design Patents in Action: Apple v. Samsung

Apple had a portfolio of over 1300 iPhone-related patents when it filed its complaint against Samsung. But Apple’s lawsuit only accused Samsung of infringing 7 of them. Apple selected these 4 design patents and 3 utility patents to capture the user interface and user experience (see Charles Mauro’s [excellent essay](http://www.mauronewmedia.com/blog/apple-v-samsung-implications-for-product-design-user-interface-ux-design-software-development-and-the-future-of-high-technology-consumer-products/) for details):

- [‘889 patent](https://www.google.com/patents/USD504889): iPad design patent

- [‘087 patent](https://www.google.com/patents/USD593087): iPhone design patent (Hardware, No GUI)

- [‘677 patent](https://www.google.com/patents/USD618677?dq=apple+677&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YZ6cUuifGczIsASVoIKoAQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA): iPhone with black color claimed (Hardware, No GUI)

- [‘305 patent](https://www.google.com/patents/USD604305): GUI for a display screen (GUI, No Hardware)

Likewise, the 3 *utility patents* are also about Apple’s user interface. Specifically, these patents claim various gestures (finger motions) used to input iPhone commands:

- [‘381](http://www.google.com/patents/US7469381) patent: touchscreen interactions

- [‘915](http://www.google.com/patents/US7844915) patent: using an API to scroll through documents

- [‘163](http://www.google.com/patents/US7864163) patent: tap-to-zoom

Apple’s ‘305 design patent protects design of the iOS home screen. Its a fairly detailed design patent, its in color, and there are very few broken lines. It should be hard for Apple to prove infringement, but they managed to use the color and detail to their advantage. Here’s how Apple used the ‘305 patent in its opening statement: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-v-galaxy-design-patent.jpg" class="translucent">  

Here’s how Samsung tried to differentiate its UI in its opening statement: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-v-samsung-os-design-patent-compare-annotated.jpg" class="translucent">  

Apple v. Samsung wasn’t just about UI patents. There were several industrial design patents at issue. Apple’s D’087 patent covered the shape of the front of its iPhone. Here’s the slide from Apple’s opening argument: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/iphone-v-vibrant-hardware-design-patent.jpg" class="translucent">  


And here’s Samsung’s response, in 3 slides: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/iphone-hardware-v-samsung-design-patent-differences.jpg" class="translucent">  

<img src="/images/design-patent/iphone-design-patent-v-samsung-bezel-design-differences.jpg" class="translucent">  

<img src="/images/design-patent/iphone-lozenge-v-samsung-vibrant-and-infuse-design-patent-compare.jpg" class="translucent">  

Apple also asserted its D’889 patent, covering the design of its iPad. Here’s Apple’s slide: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ipad-v-galaxy-tab-design-patent-compare.jpg" class="translucent">  

And here’s Samsung’s response. First, Samsung used a slide comparing Apple’s patent to some prior art: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ipad-v-galaxy-tab-fidler-design-patent-compare.jpg" class="translucent">  

Samsung then calls out the back of its tablet as being made from a multi-piece housing and including a "band" of some sort: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ipad-design-patent-v-galaxy-tab-single-piece-housing.jpg" class="translucent">  

<img src="/images/design-patent/iphone-v-samsung-hardware-back-design-patent-compare.jpg" class="translucent">  

Apple’s use of both hardware and UI design patents gave it a substantial advantage over Samsung, and resulted in a resounding victory. Tech startups can use a similar strategy, at a smaller scale, to protect their investment in creating innovative UI and hardware designs. 

# 3. Design Patent Strategies for Tech Startups

Major tech companies like Apple, Samsung and Microsoft pursue UI design patents in a big way. [Microsoft](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=0&f=S&l=50&d=PTXT&RS=%28AN%2Fsamsung+AND+%28%28%28%28%28%28%28%28%28%28CCL%2FD14%2F485+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F486%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F487%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F488%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F489%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F490%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F490%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F491%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F492%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F493%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F494%29%29&Refine=Refine+Search&Refine=Refine+Search&Query=AN%2Fmicrosoft+AND+%28CCL%2FD14%2F485+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F486+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F487+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F488+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F489+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F490+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F490+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F491+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F492+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F493+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F494%29) is aggressively growing its portfolio of 1,600 UI design patents.

Startups can follow this focused patent strategy by carefully selecting its best UI design features for patenting. Founders can focus their resources on acquiring the highest value design patents. 

A company’s unique UI design may be one of its most valuable assets. Without design patents, the UI design may be left unprotected. *Copyrights* alone are not enough. While copyright can protect creative designs, copying is subject to a number of fair use limitations. *Trademarks* alone are not enough. This type of trademark right, called "trade dress", is difficult to establish. It generally requires 5 years of heavy marketing to properly associate a startup’s UI design with its brand, and thus achieve some level of trade dress protection. ([but not always](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?&case=12034599115584297601). )  

Design patents can be used in combination with utility patents, trademarks and copyrights. These different types of intellectual property provide overlapping protections and result in more robust protection and opportunities for enforcement.

## When to Start the Design Patent Process

Start thinking about design patents as your startup moves from generic frameworks to custom UI elements. A lean startup launching a [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) from pre-packaged frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) might not have  much *new* design to protect. But when it starts to customize its user interface–especially with innovative design elements or layouts–it should start thinking about design patents. 

For critical user interface elements, think about your information architecture, navigation structure, buttons, icon and transitions. Which elements came from a pre-packaged framework? Which ones did you design from the ground up? 

Produce several drawings, and carefully distinguish the custom UI design elements from the pre-packaged elements. Depict custom elements in solid lines, and the standard elements in broken lines.

Drill down into the design. How granular can you make the custom elements before they just become standard design objects? If you can identify several granular UI levels that are not just off-the-shelf elements, you can file several design patents. In each of these design patents, only one of the granular design components should be depicted in solid lines. 

If you have existing *utility* patent applications, you can use them as a springboard for design patents. You can pull *design* patents out of the existing utility patent drawings, and even benefit from the earlier utility patent application filing date (that is, the potential universe of prior art that can be used against your design patent is limited to prior art dated before your earlier utility patent). 

**Animated UI Elements**. Animated UI elements are some of the most effective and engaging tools. [Smart animations](http://azumbrunnen.me/blog/transitions-in-ux-design/) help users understand transitions and keep focused on what’s important. For example animated scrolling, collapsing forms, progressive disclosure, pull to refresh, [pull to create new entry](http://realmacsoftware.com/clear/), and animating changes in focus have all become standard building blocks. (Adrian Zumbrunnen’s subtly animated [toggle menu](http://azumbrunnen.me/blog/transitions-in-ux-design/) is also fantastic).

For animated UI elements, use multiple drawings to depict different states. Animated and Interactive UI elements are candidates for *utility* patents as well as design patents.  

## Conclusion

UI Design is awesome. But the Patent Office doesn’t understand UI design very well. Just look at its [website](http://www.uspto.gov/patents/).  

Developing an engaging UI is slow and expensive. If you’re investing resources, and you want some degree of reasonable protection, consider a handful of UI design patents. Remember to take precautions to prevent future abuse.

**Not Needed: **


"As far as the customer is concerned, [the interface ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin)*[i*s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin)[ the product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin)." 

But since the best UI designs tend to be [invisible](http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/24/3177332/ia-oliver-reichenstein-writer-interview-good-design-is-invisible), UI design patents are a tricky animal. 

Not every product needs "unique." Some designers shortcut painstaking design research and A/B testing by just imitating a popular design experience. When you intend to donate an original design concept to the public conversation, imitation is sincere flattery. Other products may remix and riff off your original designs. But the boundary between riffing and ripping-off is hard to define. Design patents, used carefully, can facilitate a design conversation while discouraging design plagiarism. 

Designers should also learn the fundamentals of design patent law  because they may one day be on the receiving end of an infringement lawsuit. A basic understanding will help contain the damage. 

<hr class="tall">

### Standardization

Some UI elements work best when they become standardized across products. Other elements can drive sales by maintaining a unique experience. Who should decide? 

When a technology becomes essential to a field of technology, special licensing rules apply (it must be licensed out at a "fair and reasonable" rate, whatever that means). 

"Success in interaction design is largely a matter of following established patterns, so people can apply what they already know to new contexts."  *[Designing for Easy Interactio*n](http://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-easy-interaction). 

Generally, you need to secure your intellectual property rights early, either just before or just after you ship. If you secure them early, you can choose not to use them. But if you dither at the start, and someone steals your thunder, you may find its too late to secure any rights at all. 


Incumbents like Apple will not hesitate to "[steal](http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/10/ios-7-steals-mailboxs-gestures-sunrises-layout-bb10s-back-button-weboss-multitasking/)" or “[remix](http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/11/4418188/apple-ios-7-design-influences)” interesting UI designs from energetic startups.   [[Scamper Ghost game](http://junkyardsam.com/kingcopied/)] On one hand, design patents can discourage big companies from taking a free-ride on your design work. But design patents are a tool that can be misused. 


<hr class="tall">

**Trolls**. 

The vast majority of design patents are used as a tool to prevent serious design fraud, not to harass legitimate competitors. Patent abuse makes the news, but imagine the headline "*Designer Declines Opportunity to File Patent Law; Decides to Compete on Product’s Merit.*" Most patent owners are responsible. But responsible patent use is too mundane for headlines. This is not to defend patent trolls, just to put them in their place: an obnoxious parasite on a host of responsible patent owners. 

Design patents can solidify an innovative design element into long-term asset. Used responsibly, design patents can generate modest revenue  without obstructing innovation or design dialogue. 

I hope this article can help designers join the majority of responsible patent owners who only go to court reluctantly, and only to prevent the most egregious knockoffs and abusive plagiarism.

**Notes: **

"user interaction design" 

Drawings for dynamic user interactions show a series of static images like a "flip book" or storyboard.

Apple’s strategy of using design patents to protect user interface elements worked with astonishing success in Apple’s [billion dollar ](http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2012/08/apple-wins-105-billion-verdict.html)[win](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/jury-returns-verdict-in-apple-v-samsung/) over Samsung. (NOTE:   (later reduced to $600 million, then bumped back up to $900 million, with several issues still on appeal)) But Apple isn’t the only company using this strategy. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Adobe have hundreds of design patents on user interface (UI) elements as well as other components of their overall user experience (UX).
