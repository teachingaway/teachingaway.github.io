We litigate contract and intellectual property disputes. As a small firm, we provide efficient representation and carefully tailored legal strategies for small and medium size business and technology startups. 

 
## Patent Disputes
 
We litigate patent disputes in federal court in the Southern District of NY (Manhattan) and the Eastern District of NY (Brooklyn). 

We also represent clients in patent litigation before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board ("PTAB")  offers fast and relatively inexpensive tools for reviewing the validity of issued patents, such as "Inter Partes Review" ("IPR").  An IPR is an expedited procedure for invalidating patents through the Patent Office's administrative courts. Anyone subjected to a frivolous patent lawsuit should consider filing an IPR as an aggressive response. An IPR can invalidate and cancel a patent on the basis of prior art in patents or printed publications. IPR is often preferable to federal court litigation, because it is much faster, far more cost effective, and gives the party challenging the patent's validity several procedural advantages. 


## Trademark Disputes 

We litigate [trademark disputes](/trademark-services/), including trademark enforcement in federal court. We also handle cost-effective trademark opposition and cancellation proceedings at the Trademark Trial and Appeals Board. 

We have extensive experience with domain name disputes,  called “UDRP” arbitration. UDRP is an efficient legal device for evicting domain name squatters.

We litigate "opposition" and "cancellation" proceedings at the US Patent and Trademark Office. These proceedings are like a "mini trial" where the only issue to be decided is whether a pending trademark application should be allowed (an "opposition proceeding") or whether an existing trademark registration should be cancelled (a "cancellation proceeding").
