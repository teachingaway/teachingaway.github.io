We litigate complex contract and intellectual property disputes. As a small firm, we provide efficient representation and carefully tailored legal strategies without sacrificing quality. For disputes requiring more substantial resources, we connect clients with larger firms. However, for small and medium businesses, our litigation services are often the more cost-effective choice. 

 

## Federal and State Court 

### Patent Disputes
 
We litigate patent disputes in federal court in the Southern District of NY (Manhattan) and the Eastern District of NY (Brooklyn). Our litigation services are cost-effective, and appropriate for small and medium-size litigation. For more complicated patent litigation, we can help connect clients with larger law firms. 

### Trademark Disputes 

We litigate [trademark disputes](/trademark-services/), including trademark enforcement in federal court. We also handle cost-effective trademark opposition and cancellation proceedings at the Trademark Trial and Appeals Board. 

We have extensive experience with domain name disputes,  called “UDRP” arbitration. UDRP is an efficient legal device for evicting domain name squatters.

### Copyright Disputes

We litigate copyright infringement matters, including [fair use](/fair-use-illustrated-appropriation-art/) issues in federal court. We take a special interest in digital copyright and [video game cloning](/copyright-illustrated-video-game-clones/) disputes. 

### Trade Secret and Employment Disputes

Our team has experience dealing with trade secret and related employee non-compete litigation, including fast-paced temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.

## Patent and Trademark Office Administrative Courts

### Trademark Litigation at the TTAB

We litigate "opposition" and "cancellation" proceedings at the US Patent and Trademark Office. These proceedings are like a type of "mini trial" at the Trademark Office, where the only issue to be decided is whether a pending trademark application should be allowed ("opposition proceeding") or whether an existing trademark registration should be cancelled ("cancellation proceeding"). 

### Patent Litigation at the PTAB

The Patent Trial and Appeal Board offers some fast and relatively inexpensive tools for invalidating patents. 

**Recently Issued Patents: Post Grant Review**. Patents that have been issued within the last 9 months may be cancelled on any invalidity grounds through the "Post Grant Review" procedure. 

**Financial Patents: CBM**. Patents related to financial products and services may be invalidated at the PTAB through a procedure called "Covered Business Method Review" ("CBM"). We counsel clients accused of infringing a finance-related patent (whether in a lawsuit or cease-and-desist letter) on the merits of filing a CBM in reply. CBM is fast, often reaching a findal decision within 12-18 months, and at a fraction of the cost of federal court litigation. 

**Inter Partes Review**: A IPR is a fast an efficient method of invalidating patents through the Patent Office's administrative courts. Anyone subjected to a frivolous patent lawsuit should consider filing an IPR as an aggressive response. An IPR can invalidate and cancel a patent on the basis of prior art in patents or printed publications. IPR is often preferable to federal court litigation, because it is much faster, far more cost effective, and gives the party challenging the patent's validity several procedural advantages.
