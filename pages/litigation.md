We litigate complex contract and intellectual property disputes, including patent troll defense. We also help enforce legitimate IP rights in trade secret disputes, and in trademark appeals at the USPTO and litigation in federal court.

 

## Federal and State Court 

### Patent Disputes
 
We litigate patent disputes in federal court in the Southern District of NY (Manhattan) and the Eastern District of NY (Brooklyn). Our litigation services are cost-effective, and appropriate for small and medium-size litigation. For more complicated patent litigation, we can help connect clients with larger law firms. 

### Trademark Disputes 

We litigate [trademark disputes](/trademark-services/), including trademark enforcement in federal court. We also handle cost-effective trademark opposition and cancellation proceedings at the Trademark Trial and Appeals Board. 

We have extensive experience with domain name disputes,  called “UDRP” arbitration. UDRP is an efficient legal device for evicting domain name squatters.

### Copyright Disputes

We litigate copyright infringement matters, including [fair use](/fair-use-illustrated-appropriation-art/) issues in federal court. We take a special interest in digital copyright and [video game cloning](/copyright-illustrated-video-game-clones/) disputes. 

### Trade Secret and Employment Disputes

Our team has experience dealing with trade secret and related employee non-compete litigation, including fast-paced temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions.

## At the US Patent and Trademark Office

### Trademark Litigation at the TTAB

We litigate "opposition" and "cancellation" proceedings at the US Patent and Trademark Office. These proceedings are like a type of "mini trial" at the Trademark Office, where the only issue to be decided is whether a pending trademark application should be allowed ("opposition proceeding") or whether an existing trademark registration should be cancelled ("cancellation proceeding"). 

### Patent Litigation at the PTAB

The Patent Trial and Appeal Board offers some fast and relatively inexpensive tools for invalidating patents. 

**Recently Issued Patents: Post Grant Review**. Patents that have been issued within the last 9 months are subject to the "Post Grant Review" procedure. There is some "estoppel" risk involved in a PGR. If you file a PGR and lose, then trying to argue invalidity in Federal Court can be difficult. 

**Financial Patents: CBM**. Patents related to financial products and services are subject to a procedure called "Covered Business Method Review" ("CBM"). We counsel clients accused of infringing a finance-related patent (whether in a lawsuit or cease-and-desist letter) on filing a CBM in reply. CBM is fast, often reaching a findal decision within 12-18 months. CBM is also substantially cheaper than federal court litigation. 

**Inter Partes Review**: An IPR can invalidate and cancel a patent on the basis of prior art in patents or printed publications.
