# UI Design Patents

While design patents are complicated and controversial, they do exist, and designers will sometimes have to deal with them. This article discusses design patent system as it exists, while conveniently ignoring the controversy. Basically, I’m going to explain the machine, not rage against it. Whether you want to patent a new design, or you’re on the business end of a lawsuit, a little background knowledge can be handy. 

Imagine a designer who just solved a pesky UI annoyance with an innovative interface element or animation. She smiles, knowing that users will love it, and even grandma will immediately understand it. She Googles around, and no one else has thought of it before. 

Solving complicated UI problems creates real value. Designers can either (a) donate this solution to the public domain, (b) lock it up in patents and copyrights, or (c) protect it at some intermediate level–*some rights reserved*. Lets start with public domain and the Creative Commons (some rights reserved), then scroll on over to design patents. 

**Public Domain**. Not every UI design is eligible for a patent, and not every *eligible* design *needs* to be patented. Most UI elements and patterns are already in the public domain, and new UI designs can be donated to the community. 

Public domain is easy, but its not automatic. To ensure a design is dedicated to the public, a designer should announce her intention with a Creative Commons "[CC0](http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0)" notice, or label it “no rights reserved” or “public domain.” That should do the trick. 

**Creative Commons**. If full-blown public domain is a little too free, Creative Commons offers some handy [standardized licenses.  ](http://creativecommons.org/choose/)CC licenses are generally free-as-in-beer, but generally *not* free-as-in-speech. The various CC options help designers retain rights to their work, while also encouraging other folks to use and sometimes build on the original design. For example, you can let people use it at no cost for non-commercial purposes, but charge them a fee if they want to use your design in business. Or you can let people use your design at no cost, but only if they give you credit and a link. 

## Responsible Use / Twitter IPA. 

When I promised I wasn’t going to touch the patent controversy, I pretty much lied. Patent trolls are are a serious problem, particularly in the software world. Patent problems tend to arise when designers and inventors lose control of their patents, and the patents eventually fall into the clutches of trolls. Some simple legal tools, like Twitter’s Innovator’s Patent Agreement, can prevent trolls from abusing  patents. Twitter’s [IPA](https://blog.twitter.com/2012/introducing-innovators-patent-agreement) prohibits weaponizing patents without the inventors consent, and the [Defensive Patent License](http://defensivepatentlicense.drupalgardens.com/) prohibits offensive patent litigation against anyone who decides to join the DPL pool.

Twitter’s IPA is like the security systems installed in early [nuclear weapons](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/01/strangelove-for-real.html). "If the United States went to war, two people would be necessary to unlock a nuclear weapon, each of them provided with half the code." With the IPA, two people are required to launch a patent lawsuit: the owner and the inventor. This is a critical safety mechanism because inventors are rarely interested in filing frivolous lawsuits. In fact, most frivolous lawsuits seem to come from small patent-assertion companies that buy up patents several years after they’re issued. 

This post has 3 parts. First, we discuss the basics of **design patent law** and how design patents differ from utility patents, copyright and trademarks. Second, we give some **examples** of how technology companies use design patents to protect user interface elements like layouts, transitions, controls, and typography.  Finally, we discuss how technology startups can use design patents to build robust intellectual property **portfolios**. 

# 1. Law of Design Patents

Design patents protect the *appearance* of a design, and the protection lasts for *15 years*. They are relatively inexpensive, easy to enforce, and infringement can result in monetary penalties.  

**Application Process**. Design patents take about a year from application to issuance (compare to 3-5 years for a utility patent). Budget about $3-4,000 in total costs for a typical UI design patent (a utility patent is more expensive, maybe $8-20,000). 

**Somewhat Non-Functional. **Where utility patents protection functional inventions, design patents protect non-functional inventions. Or at least mostly-non-functional inventions. The Design Patent Statute limits protection to the "ornamental" design of a product. But courts interpret “*ornamental*” to really mean “*non-functional.”* Other courts have further interpreted “non-functional designs” to mean something like any design that is not entirely dictated by function. In practice, most UI elements are eligible for design patent protection, even if the designs are partly functional. 

A design will only be non-patentable if its overall appearance is "dictated by function." That is, if the design is governed *solely* by the product’s function, the design cannot be patented. On the other hand, if alternative designs are available for performing the same function, the design is [not dictated ](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5349194340358969962)solely by its function, and it can be patented.

* The patent statute says design patents are available to protect the "[ornamental design for an article of manufacture](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/171)."

* which really means design patents protect "non-functional designs"

* which really means that design patents protect anything except designs solely "dictated by function."  

**Easy Litigation**. Design patents are easy to enforce. The legal issues simply involve comparing the plaintiff’s design patent drawings to the defendant’s product. It doesn’t take an expensive team of experts to detect infringement or bring a case to trial. (NOTE:  Although expensive experts are often used in high-stakes design patent litigation, they are not necessarily required. And of course, lawyers are still expensive. ) A judge or jury can simply compare the pictures in the plaintiff’s design patent to the defendant’s product.

**Infringement**. A design patent is infringed if "an ordinary observer, familiar with the prior art designs, would be deceived into believing that the accused product is the same as the patented design." *[Richardson v. Stanley Work*s](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4065677538492368378). 

**Prior Art**. Prior art is relevant to this comparison. The differences between the claimed design and the allegedly infringing design "are viewed in light of the prior art." Since the ordinary observer is viewing the designs in light of the prior art, her attention will be “drawn to those aspects of the claimed design that differ from the prior art.”  *[Crocs v. Int’l Trade Commissio*n](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8466727333574506240). 

The closer the plaintiff’s design patent is to any prior art designs, the harder it is to show the defendant’s product is infringing. Where the prior art is similar to the design patent, even small differences between the design patent and the defendant’s design become important. "The ordinary observer, however, will likely attach importance to those differences depending on the overall effect of those differences on the design." *[Crocs v. Int’l Trade Commissio*n](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8466727333574506240). 

In litigation, defendants frequently use prior art to reduce the potency of the plaintiff’s design patents. When Apple alleged that Samsung’s Galaxy tab infringed an iPad design patent, Samsung replied by digging up examples of prior art tablets. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ipad-v-galaxy-tab-fidler-design-patent-compare.jpg">  

Samsung was making a simple argument: the Galaxy tab doesn’t copy Apple’s ‘889 design patent, its just using public-domain design elements like the prior art like the  a rectangle with rounded corners found in the 1994 "Fiddler" tablet. 

**Infringement Consequences**. The penalties for *design* patent infringement are large, and often larger than the damages in a comparable *utility* patent case.  This is because design patent damages are not "apportioned." In utility patent cases, [damages](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/284) are awarded in proportion to the extent that the infringing feature drove the defendant’s profits. But for design patent infringement, there is no such reduction. Instead, the plaintiff is awarded the infringer’s “*[total profi*t](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/289).”

The design patent owner may also be awarded an "injunction" – a court order forbidding the defendant from selling any products that use the plaintiff’s patented design.

## Design Patent Drawings

The drawings are the heart of a design patent. They define the design that is being protected. 

In design patent drawings, the difference between solid lines and dashed lines is critical. *Solid lines *identify the parts of the design that are actually protected by the patent. *Dashed lines* are used to show context or environment.

Solid lines represent protected design elements, but the more solid lines in a drawing, the narrower the protection it affords. This is a counterintuitive concept and merits some explanation. 

More solid lines in a design patent drawing generates narrower protection because an infringing product must incorporate each element shown in solid lines, not just some of them. 

Compare the "patent" drawing in the upper left to the “product in the upper-right. The patent shows a square and a triangle in solid lines. Since the product doesn’t have a triangle, its not infringing the patent. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/solid-v-dashed-line-in-design-patent-example.png">  

Now look at the patent in the lower-left. It has a square drawn in solid lines, and a triangle in dashed lines. This time, we ignore the triangle. Since the product has the matching square element, its infringing the design patent. 

More dashed lines leads to stronger protection. A real-life example from *Apple v. Samsung *will help explain: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/iphone-v-samsung-lozenge-design-patent-compare.png" >  

Apple’s D’087 patent uses *solid* lines to depict the shape of its microphone (a rounded-rectangle) but *dashed* lines for its circular home button. This means that the circular home button (dashed) is not considered in the infringement analysis. Samsung’s phones can’t avoid infringement by using a non-circular home button. 

The microphone in Apple’s patent is drawn in *solid* lines. So Samsung can only infringe if its product incorporates a microphone with the same rounded-rectangle shape. Samsung argued this point at trial, and highlighted the differences between the Samsung microphone shape and the Apple microphone shape. This would be a winning strategy for Samsung, if the shapes were actually different. The jury thought Samsung’s microphone was just another rounded-rectangle. Maybe if Samsung’s microphone was a pure rectangle it could have avoided design patent infringement. 

Apple’s D’087 patent could have been even stronger by showing the microphone in dashed lines. If the microphone was shown in dashed lines, a competitors phone would be infringing if it used the design shown in solid lines, regardless of what shape it used for its microphone or home button. In short, dashed lines make design patents stronger by making it easier to prove infringement.  

## Design Patents Compared to Other Intellectual Property

Design patents are a strange amalgam of utility patents, copyrights, and trademarks. This section discusses the differences, and how these different IP rights can conflict or overlap. 

### Utility Patent vs. Design Patent

A utility patent protects *functional* aspects of an invention, while a design patent protects new *nonfunctional designs*. As the [statute](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/171) puts it, any "new, original and ornamental design for an article of manufacture" may be granted a 15 year design patent.

Design patent applications are cheaper and faster than utility patent applications. A design patent application costs about $3-4,000 (total) and takes about a year to issue. A utility patent application costs between $8,000-20,000 (total) and lingers in the Patent Office for around 3 years before being issued as a patent. 

To distinguish between a utility patent and a design patent, look at the patent number. If it starts with the letter "D" or “USD”, its a design patent. The design patent document is generally much shorter than a utility patent document. Design patents have a page or two of text followed by several drawings. Utility patents are bloated with long-winded written descriptions. 

Interactive UI design elements can be protected with by both utility patents and design patents. For example, [pull-to-refresh](https://www.google.com/patents/US8448084) is a utility patent.  As is Apple’s [pinch-to-zoom](http://www.google.com/patents/US7469381) patent. 

### Copyright vs. Design Patents

Copyright can protect many types of creative works, but this discussion will be limited to copyrighting software, UI elements, and works of industrial design. 

**Non-Functional**. Both copyrights and design patents protect *non-functional* designs. Copyright law applies the non-functional requirement rigorously, while design patent law is lax about what it considers "non-functional." Copyright protection rarely applies to a design that is even *partly* functional. But design patent protection can apply to functional aspects of UI designs and industrial designs. 

**Duration.** Copyright protection lasts longer. Design patents protect industrial design for 15 years. Copyrights protect works of creative authorship for 95 years (often more, but sometimes less, according to some [complicated rules](http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-duration.html)).

**Infringement**. The rules for infringement are different. Copyright infringement requires "copying." That is, an infringer must have seen the original copyrighted work at some point. Design patents can be infringed by sheer coincidence. For example, someone who has never seen an iPhone or Apple’s design patents can still infringe them. And, unlike copyright, there is no “fair use” defense for design patent infringement.

Copyright only protects designs that have been expressed in a "tangible medium." That is, the design needs to be real and actually executed. A design patent doesn't. A design patent can protect a purely hypothetical design; a design that hasn't yet been executed in a product. 

### Trademark vs. Design Patent

Trade dress, a branch of trademark law, can also protect the non-functional appearance of a product, software design or of certain types of UI elements. But trade dress law revolves around *brand identification *and protecting business *reputations*. Trade dress rights are more difficult to establish than design patent rights, and are not well suited for protecting UI elements. 

**Infringement**. The owner of trade dress rights can prevent a second company from using design elements that are so similar to the protected design that consumers will be confused into thinking the second company’s product is made by the first company, or that the second company is somehow associated with the first company. Put differently, trade dress is infringed if a defendant’s design will confuse consumers into thinking the defendant’s product is actually made by–or somehow associated with–the plaintiff. 

**Functionality**. Trade dress only protects non-functional aspects of a design. Like copyright law (and unlike design patent law), this prohibition against protecting functional design elements is strictly enforced. In litigation, a trade dress plaintiff is required to prove that the trade dress is non-functional. In design patent litigation, a judge will presume the plaintiff’s design patent is nonfunctional, and the defendant can only disprove it with clear and convincing evidence.  

**Perpetual**. Trade dress rights, once established, can be perpetual. Unlike design patents, trade dress rights do not have a set expiration date. Trade dress rights will only expire when a company stops using the trade dress designs to sell a product. 

**For Particular Products**. Each grant of trade dress rights is limited to a particular type or category of product. Design patents are not so narrowly limited. For example, Google’s trade dress rights for its  landing page will prevent other people from using a similar design for a search engine, but perhaps not from using a similar design for a launchrock page, where the simple input box is for an email signup rather than search input (This is just an example, don’t try this at home).
