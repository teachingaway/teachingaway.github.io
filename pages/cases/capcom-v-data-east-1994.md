*Capcom U.S.A., Inc. v. Data East Corp.,* 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5306  (Northern District of California, March 16, 1994). 

Opinion: Judge William H. Orrick

**Opinion and Order**

The plaintiff, Capcom U.S.A., Inc. (“Capcom”), has filed a motion to preliminarily enjoin defendants, Data East Corp. and Data East USA (“Data East”), from distributing the video game, Fighter’s History, which Capcom alleges infringes upon its Street Fighter II series of video games. A hearing on the motion was held on January 12, 19 and 21, 1994. The Court received live testimony which was supplemented by voluminous documentary and audiovisual evidence.[^1] For the reasons set forth in this order, which constitutes the Court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law required by Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court denies Capcom’s motion for a preliminary injunction.

[^1]: Both sides moved to strike various evidentiary materials. The Court has considered these motions and other objections to the evidence and has based its decision on evidence deemed to be admissible. Most importantly, at the outset of the hearing, Data East moved to exclude Capcom’s audiovisual evidence claiming it was untimely submitted and contained material distortions of the visual images of Fighter’s History. The Court denied the motion to strike finding that the parties had stipulated to the submission of the videotapes on the date Capcom filed them and concluding that the distortions resulting from manipulations of the images affected the weight the evidence would carry, but not its admissibility. The Court allowed Data East to file supplemental videotapes to highlight the alleged distortions contained in Capcom’s audiovisual submissions. [*2] 

## I. [BACKGROUND]

### A. [Parties]

Capcom Co., Ltd. registered copyrights with the United States Copyright Office and obtained copyright registration certificates for its Street Fighter, Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Champion Edition, and Street Fighter II Champion Edition Hyper Fighting video games. [^2] Capcom has an exclusive license in North America to the copyrights in these games, including the right to bring suit to enforce the copyrights in the United States.

[^2]: Capcom’s audiovisual evidence consisted solely of excerpts taken from the Street Fighter II and Street Fighter II Champion Edition versions of the game.

Street Fighter II was introduced in February 1991, followed by its two enhanced arcade versions, Street Fighter II Champion Edition and Street Fighter II Champion Edition Hyper Fighting. Capcom and Capcom Co., Ltd. have expended considerable resources in developing and promoting the Street Fighter series. Street Fighter II has been among the most successful video games in history. Since its release in 1991, close to 50,000 [*3] arcade versions of the Street Fighter II series have been sold in the United States. These arcade sales contrast sharply with the sale of 3,000 to 5,000 arcade units that Capcom maintains is typical for video games. In addition, Capcom has sold over two million home versions of the Street Fighter II series in the United States for use on both the Sega and Nintendo home video systems. A full length film featuring the Street Fighter II characters is scheduled for release this summer.

Data East introduced its video game, Fighter’s History, in March 1993. Pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, Data East has suspended all sales and promotion of Fighter’s History pending resolution of this motion. Capcom presently seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent Data East, its agents, servants and employees, from manufacturing, promoting, selling or distributing Fighter’s History or any derivative of it anywhere in the world. Capcom also seeks an order requiring Data East to recall from its distributors and retailers all Fighter’s History games that have been sold or shipped worldwide and an order that all Fighter’s History games be impounded while this action is pending.

Capcom alleges [*4] that Data East’s Fighter’s History copies the distinctive fighting styles, appearances, special moves and combination attacks of many of Street Fighter II’s characters, as well as the control sequences used to execute their moves. Additionally, Capcom accuses Data East of unlawfully obtaining a “free ride” on Capcom’s investment and success.

In response, Data East argues that there is nothing innovative about Capcom’s Street Fighter II. Rather, Data East maintains that Street Fighter II is just another entry into an already crowded field of one-on-one fight games--a genre created by Data East--and is comprised of largely stereotypical characters and fight moves that are commonplace and unprotectable. To the extent that there are similarities between the games, Data East posits that this results from the fact that Fighter’s History, like every other video game in the genre, uses the same format and draws from the same public domain of stereotyped characters, not because Data East has copied Capcom.

In addition, Data East maintains that a number of alleged similarities between the games are, upon inspection, not similar. Finally, Data East argues that it has submitted ample evidence [*5] of independent creation to rebut any circumstantial inference that it copied its characters and moves from Capcom. Data East maintains that Capcom’s real goal is to insulate itself from competition in the highly lucrative video game industry.

### B. The Games

Both Street Fighter II and Fighter’s History fall within the one-on-one, reality based fight genre that has enjoyed sustained popularity among video game players. Early entries in the field include Data East’s “Karate Champ.” The early versions of fight games frequently contained two characters pitted against one another, and the fight sequences lacked special, unreal moves, but rather mimicked real life fighting styles such as karate and wrestling. Like Street Fighter II and Fighter’s History, however, some of these early games allowed players to engage in role-playing by providing a host of distinctive characters with different fighting styles from which the player could select.

Street Fighter II has twelve players, eight from which the player can select and four controlled by the computer. Fighter’s History has nine characters in all, seven from which a player can select and two controlled by the computer. [^3] Each game can [*6] be played by one or two players who engage in matches in which one fighter can fight himself or other fighters. Each character has a particular personality and fighting style containing a variety of special moves and combination attacks. Special moves are fantasy based moves, not derived from real fighting techniques. Combination attacks are a series of special moves executed in rapid sequence that, if properly executed, cannot be blocked once the first move in the attack connects with the opponent.

[^3]: The Street Fighter II characters are: Guile, Sagat, Ryu, Ken, Chun Li, Zangief, Vega, E. Honda, Blanka, Balrog, M. Bison and Dhalsim. The Fighter’s History characters are: Matlok, Samchay, Mizoguchi, Ray, Jean, Feilin, Marstorius, and Ryoko and Lee.

In both games, the characters’ moves and defenses are controlled by an eight position joystick, and three kick and three punch buttons of varying intensities. The characters’ special moves are invoked by distinct control sequences. Finally, in both Street Fighter II and [*7] Fighter’s History, the fighter who wins two-of-three rounds wins the fight; each round is won by depleting the opponent’s vitality bar or having more vitality remaining when the round expires.

## II. [ANALYSIS]

### A. Applicable Standard

To prevail on its motion for a preliminary injunction, Capcom must show either: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury, or (2) that serious questions going to the merits exist and the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor. Johnson Controls, Inc. v. Phoenix Control Systems, Inc., 886 F.2d 1173, 1174 (9th Cir. 1989). “These two formulations represent two points on a sliding scale in which the required degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of success decreases.” Oakland Tribune, Inc. v. The Chronicle Publishing Co., 762 F.2d 1374, 1376 (9th Cir. 1985). A showing of a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of a copyright claim raises a presumption of irreparable harm. Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d at 1174.

### B. Elements of a Copyright Infringement Claim

To establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff [*8] must show, first, that it owns a valid copyright in the infringed work and, second, that the defendant copied expression protected by the copyright. Brown Bag Software v. Symantec Corp., 960 F.2d 1465, 1467 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied,  U.S.  , 113 S. Ct. 198 (1992). The copyright registration certificates filed by Capcom constitute prima facie evidence of validity and ownership. Johnson Controls, 886 F.2d at 1175. As the exclusive licensee for North America, Capcom has standing to sue to enforce the copyrights held by Capcom Co., Ltd. 17 U.S.C. § 501(b). Thus, Capcom has established the first element of copyright infringement.

To satisfy the second element of its copyright infringement claim, Capcom must demonstrate either direct evidence of copying by Data East, or circumstantial evidence through a combination of access to the copyrighted work and substantial similarity between the copyrighted work and the accused product. Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc., 862 F.2d 204, 206 (9th Cir. 1988).

**1. Direct Evidence of Copying**

Capcom did not submit any evidence of direct copying of the computer program for Street Fighter II by Data East. [*9] Rather, Capcom’s claim of copyright infringement hinges upon circumstantial evidence of copying such as Data East’s project proposal for Fighter’s History which makes repeated references to Street Fighter II and the similarities in characters and moves between the two games. As a result, the Court must apply the two part test of access and substantial similarity to assess Capcom’s claim of copyright infringement.

**2. Data East’s Access to Street Fighter II**

The first of the two prongs that courts use to establish circumstantial evidence of copying considers whether the defendant had access to the copyrighted item. Street Fighter II games have been widely disseminated in the United States and Japan. Evidence of such public dissemination establishes the defendant’s access to the games. Sid & Marty Krofft Television Prod., Inc. v. McDonald’s Corp., 562 F.2d 1157, 1172 (9th Cir. 1977). In addition, in this case, Data East has conceded that its development team actually studied Street Fighter II in the hopes of beating Capcom at [*10] its own game by creating an even more exciting and original one-on-one fight video.

Capcom has submitted Data East’s December 18, 1991 project proposal for Fighter’s History--a nine page document that contains over 22 references to Street Fighter II and not a single reference to any other game in the genre. [Decl. of Misako Maki Sack, filed January 5, 1994, Ex. B.] The proposal emphasizes Street Fighter II’s continued popularity with game players and states that Data East’s game will “target those who are used to playing” Street Fighter II. [Sack Decl., Ex. B at 2.] It further states that Data East will “follow [Street Fighter II] with respect to the basic game system (control system, etc.), and differentiate it in other areas.” Id.

Capcom argues that the quality and extent of Data East’s access to and use of Street Fighter II bears upon the Court’s evaluation of other elements of Capcom’s case. Case law provides some support for this position. In Sid & Marty Krofft, the Ninth Circuit noted:

> No amount of proof of access will suffice to show copying if there are no similarities. This is not to say, however, that where clear and convincing evidence of access is presented, [*11] the quantum of proof required to show substantial similarity may not be lower than when access is shown merely by a preponderance of the evidence.

562 F.2d at 1172 (citing 2 Nimmer on Copyright, § 143.4 at 634)(other citations omitted).

Data East argues in its opposition brief and declarations that many changes were made during the development of Fighter’s History to avoid similarity with Street Fighter II. It concedes, however, that it “studied” and “analyzed” Street Fighter II. [Decl. of Ryoji Minagawa, filed Dec. 1, 1993, PP 6, 7; Decl. of Mansori Oe, filed Dec. 1, 1993, P 19.] It also concedes that it hired a company named “Zero One” to create the draft of Fighter’s History, but was forced to discard some of what was submitted because it was deemed to be too similar to Street Fighter II. [Minagawa Decl., PP 8, 13 & 16.] With the exception of one character, Data East’s development team modified all of the other fifteen characters presented by Zero One.

Data East maintains that it has rebutted Capcom’s circumstantial evidence of copying with direct evidence of independent creation. In particular, Data East has submitted hundreds of pages of exhibits [*12] of cartoon characters, comic books, movie advertisements, etc., from which Data East claims to have drawn its inspiration for its Fighter’s History characters. In addition, it maintains that Mr. Oe, who was responsible for developing the costumes and special moves of the Fighter’s History characters, redesigned many of the ones presented by Zero One so as to be faithful to each character’s particular martial art and history. He specifically studied Street Fighter II and other fight games to insure that Fighter’s History would present unique characters to players. In sum, Data East maintains that its evidence establishes that Data East independently designed an original game with fresh characters and fighting styles thereby rebutting Capcom’s circumstantial evidence of copying.

Data East’s argument is not persuasive. While the independent sources submitted as evidence by Data East may have contributed to the development of its Fighter’s History characters, the submissions do not refute the strong evidence that Data East set out to copy Street Fighter II’s success and that Data East developers spent hours studying the game to see how this goal might be accomplished. Thus, while other [*13] outside sources may have influenced the development of the Fighter’s History characters, there is no doubt that Street Fighter II characters also provided a significant source of inspiration.

Copying alone, however, is not sufficient to state a claim in copyright if the elements copied are not protectable. While Capcom has established both that Data East had wholesale access to Street Fighter II and that its development team sought to deliberately emulate the overall style of the game in the hopes of capturing its success, Capcom must further establish that Fighter’s History is substantially similar to Street Fighter II and that the similarity results from protectable expression. Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co., 429 F.2d 1106, 1109 n.3 (9th Cir. 1970).


**3. Similarity Between the Two Games**

The second prong in the two-prong test that courts use to establish circumstantial evidence of copying examines the two works for substantial similarity. The Ninth Circuit uses a two-part substantial similarity test to determine whether a challenged work infringes a copyrighted work. First, the two works are compared for substantial similarity using an “extrinsic [*14] test” or “objective analysis” of expression. Brown Bag Software, 960 F.2d at 1475; see also Sid & Marty Krofft, 562 F.2d at 1164. A court may enlist the assistance of “analytic dissection” and expert testimony to aid it in identifying the core of protectable expression under the extrinsic test.

Second, an “intrinsic” or subjective test is employed to ascertain whether there exists a substantial similarity in expression of underlying ideas. Brown Bag Software, 960 F.2d at 1475; see also Data East, 862 F.2d at 208. The intrinsic test consists solely of the response of the ordinary reasonable person to the question of whether the challenged work captures the “total concept and feel” of the protected work. Data East, 862 F.2d at 208.

**a. Application of the Extrinsic Test**

As stated above, the extrinsic test determines whether substantial similarity exists between the copyrighted work and the allegedly infringing piece. Under the extrinsic test, a court must engage in “analytic dissection” of the alleged similarities to determine whether [*15] similarities stem from unprotectable or protectable expression. Brown Bag Software, 960 F.2d at 1475.

A court must filter out those elements of the copyrighted work that are deemed unprotectable, and reserve only protectable expression for comparison under the subjective test. Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 821 F. Supp. 616, 623 (N.D. Cal. 1993). “If the similarity of the works in suit stems solely from unprotectible features, then the plaintiff’s case is missing an essential element of infringement.” Apple Computer Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 799 F. Supp. 1006, 1020 (N.D. Cal. 1992). Therefore, the analytic dissection serves two functions: (1) it first determines the parameters of the copyrightable expression; and (2) the dissected, protectable elements can then be compared individually with the corresponding elements of the challenged work to detect similarities. Brown Bag, 960 F.2d 1465 at 1475.

The Ninth Circuit has identified several categories of unprotectable elements that must be filtered out of the analysis under the extrinsic test. First, [*16] “it is axiomatic that copyright protects only the expression of ideas and not the ideas themselves.” Broderbund Software, Inc. v. Unison World, 648 F. Supp. 1127, 1131 (N.D. Cal. 1986). Consequently, if an idea and the expression of that idea cannot be separated, the merger doctrine provides that only identical copying of the expression is barred. See Krofft, 565 F.2d at 167-68; see also Apple Computer, 799 F. Supp. at 1021 (“Merger means there is practically only one way to express an idea.”).

Similarly, the scenes-a-faire doctrine excludes from copyright protection “expressions that are ‘as a practical matter, indispensable or at least standard in the treatment of a given [idea].’” Data East, 862 F.2d at 208 (quoting Aliotti v. R. Dakin & Co., 831 F.2d 898 (9th Cir. 1987)). The scenes-a-faire doctrine includes “stock” characters and plots in dramatic works and “now encompasses stereotyped expression, standard or common features in a wide variety of works, including audiovisual works generated by computers.” Apple Computer, 799 F. Supp. at 1021 [*17] (emphasis added).

Additionally, the functional aspects of a work may also be denied copyright protection if they constitute methods of operation, procedures or processes. 17 U.S.C. § 102(b). Finally, unoriginal elements of the copyrighted work are not eligible for protection. Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Serv., 499 U.S. 340, 348, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358, 111 S. Ct. 1282 (1991).

Capcom has identified a number of alleged similarities between Street Fighter II and Fighter’s History. These similarities can be divided into four primary categories: (1) similarities in characters; (2) similarities in special moves and combination attacks; (3) similarities in control sequences; and (4) miscellaneous similarities in the general presentation and flow of the games. Each of these categories of alleged similarities will be examined independently. Because the Court finds that the third and fourth categories are not eligible for copyright protection, they will be examined first and quickly filtered out of the analysis.

**i. Similarities in Control Sequences**

Capcom urges that in addition [*18] to copying its characters and their fighting styles, Data East has copied a number of the specific joystick and button combinations that a player must execute to invoke particular moves. Data East has done so, Capcom maintains, in order to attract experienced players from Street Fighter II, who would instantly feel accustomed to Fighter’s History.

To support its position that these control sequences are protectable, Capcom notes that the Ninth Circuit has held that copyright protects the “non-literal components” of a computer program, including the “user-interface,” if there is “room for individualized expression.” Johnson Controls 886 F.2d at 1175-76. In particular, Capcom relies heavily on a prior decision by this Court in which it held that the audiovisual screens used to invoke functions in plaintiff’s “Print Shop” desktop program constituted protectable expression. Broderbund, 648 F. Supp. at 1131-34; see also Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int’l, Inc., 799 F. Supp. 203, 216-21 (D. Mass. 1992) (Court found copyright infringement based on defendant’s copying of plaintiff’s keystroke sequences [*19] used to perform specific spreadsheet operations.).

A review of the Broderbund opinion reveals, however, that the decision pivoted on the finding that the idea underlying the menu screens and sequencing of them was distinguishable from its particular expression as presented in plaintiff’s “Print Shop” program. Id. at 1132-33. The Court emphasized that other ways of expressing the same idea were available to competitors and, as such, Broderbund was entitled to have its particular expression protected. Id. In addition, the Court stressed that “the structure, sequence, and layout of the audiovisual displays in ‘Print Shop’ were dictated primarily by artistic and aesthetic considerations, and not by utilitarian or mechanical ones.” Id. at 1134.

Here, the opposite is true. Unlike the menu screens and keystroke commands at issue in Broderbund and Lotus, the control sequences presently at issue cannot be expressed in limitless ways. Rather, the expression of an idea and the underlying idea frequently merge in the area of control sequences because the player simply presses the button corresponding to the move he wishes to have produced on the screen. For example, to get [*20] a fighter to kick, the player simply presses one of the three kick buttons. To get a fighter to jump up, the player simply moves the joystick into a vertical position--the idea and its expression coincide.

In addition, and perhaps more importantly, several functional and practical constraints that limit the number of ways the control sequences can be designed. For example, the use of a joystick is functionally constrained because there are only eight possible positions the joystick can occupy. Moreover, the technique that a developer uses in creating joystick sequences is further constrained by the fact that the movements must be connected--the joystick can move only from one position to a neighboring position. This requirement reduces the potential number of possible joystick combinations.

On the practical level, the universe of possible joystick combinations is further restricted by the need to have the control sequence emulate the natural movements of the body. To make the game realistic and easy to learn, a developer must have its control sequences follow the natural flow of the fighter’s body. The player must be allowed to manipulate the control panel in an intuitive manner if [*21] he or she is going to become proficient at the game. For example, to mirror the physical aspects of throwing an object, the developer would want to choose a joystick/button control sequence that consists of pulling the joystick backwards to follow the arms as they draw back and then moving the joystick forward and hitting a punch button as the character winds up and releases the object. The idea of throwing an object and its expression as reflected in a distinct control sequence will, therefore, coincide.

Finally, under the law of the Ninth Circuit, an article that has “any intrinsic utilitarian function” is ineligible for copyright protections “except to the extent that its artistic features can be identified separately and are capable of existing independently as a work of art.” Fabrica, Inc. v. El Dorado Corp., 697 F.2d 890, 893. (9th Cir. 1983). At least one court in this district has held that a computer user interface performs a highly utilitarian function and is only protectable if it contains “separate artistic features” or has been bodily appropriated for use by a competitor. Apple Computer, 799 F. Supp. at 1023. [*22] Here, there are no identifiable artistic features in the control sequences that are separable from their functional purpose.

To refute the argument that the control sequences are not protectable because of the merger doctrine and because of certain functional and practical constraints, Capcom points to several control sequences in Fighter’s History that are identical to Street Fighter II that do not emulate the body’s natural movement, but instead are wholly arbitrary.

For example, Capcom notes that a Matlok control sequence has the player move the joystick into a crouch position, even though Matlok does not actually crouch. This sequence, Capcom maintains, is similar to a sequence in Street Fighter II that has Guile performing a similar move and was dictated by Data East’s desire to have Matlok and Guile play in a similar manner. In addition, Capcom underscores the fact that in several Fighter’s History control sequences the control buttons are arbitrarily disabled in the exact same manner as they occur in a Street Fighter II sequence. While the Court is disturbed by these “coincidences” in some of the arbitrary control sequences, it concludes that because the control sequences do [*23] not constitute protectable expression, these isolated similarities are not actionable.

In addition, the Court finds that many of the eighteen control sequences in Fighter’s History which Capcom claims are identical to ones in Street Fighter II are in fact not similar, unless the Court treats the use of a punch button as identical to the use of a kick button, or the use of any one of three backward positions on the joystick as identical. Such sweeping characterizations of dissimilar controls as similar, however, would result in placing entire areas of the control panel off-limits for competitors trying to create a sequence for a similar move.

**ii. Similarities in Miscellaneous Features**

Capcom seeks to protect a variety of miscellaneous features in Street Fighter II including its “attract mode” and “VS.” screens and its method of selecting characters, designating winners and tracking a fighter’s vitality during a fight. These features, however, are commonplace. Indeed, several of the non-infringing games that Capcom submitted to the Court for purposes of comparison include these same features. [Pl.’s Videotape 2, filed January 5, 1994, excerpts from Mortal Kombat and Samurai [*24] Shodown.]

Almost all of the games, for example, have a vitality bar that runs across the top of the video screen and changes color to indicate the percentage of strength the fighter has left. In addition, most of the games contain similar winner designations to indicate which fighter has won the round. Neither these individual features, nor their particular compilation in Street Fighter II are original to Capcom. Rather, they are better viewed as unprotectable scenes-a-faire, “expressions that are ‘as a practical matter, indispensable or at least standard in the treatment of a given [idea].’” Data East, 862 F.2d at 208 (citations omitted). Consequently, they are not entitled to copyright protection.

**iii. Similarities in Characters, Special Moves and Combination Attacks**

Capcom maintains that Street Fighter II revolutionized the genre of one-on-one fight games by introducing highly individualized characters, each with a distinctive fighting style, appearance and special magic moves and combination attacks. It alleges that Fighter’s History is a copy of Street Fighter II that replicates the distinctive fighting style, appearance and special moves [*25] of many of the Street Fighter II characters. More specifically, Capcom urges that Data East has copied the physical appearance of seven of Street Fighter II’s eight playable characters and has reproduced twenty-seven of the characters’ special moves for use in its game.

It is Data East’s belief that upon performing analytic dissection of the controverted characters and their special moves, the Court will discover that many of the alleged similarities between the two games stem from pure ideas or Fighter II. In addition, Data East is confident that an examination of the remaining protectable material will reveal that allegedly similar special moves are actually executed in strikingly different manners.

Fortunately, this is not the first case to examine the similarity of two video games, and the Court has some case law from which to draw guidance. As a prefatory matter, it is widely recognized that because copyright protection extends only to the expression of an idea and not the idea itself,

the idea and the expression will coincide when the expression provides nothing new or additional over the idea. . . . When idea and expression coincide, there will be protection against nothing [*26] other than identical copying of the work. . . . The scope of copyright protection increases with the extent expression differs from the idea.

Sid & Marty Krofft, 562 F.2d at 1168. This concept of coincidence between idea and expression is known as the merger doctrine because the expression merges with the underlying idea. “As a result, copyright protection does not encompass games as such, since they consist of abstract rules and play ideas.” Midway Mfg. Co. v. Bandai-America, Inc., 546 F. Supp. 125, 148 (D.N.J. 1982) (citations omitted), aff’d 775 F.2d 70 (3d Cir. 1985). It follows, therefore, that audiovisual works like the two presently before the Court are largely unprotectable games. Id.

Professor Nimmer has noted, however, that “some limited copyright protection is nevertheless available in connection with games. . . . [A] relatively minimal artistic expression, if original, would render copyrightable . . . the pattern or design of game boards and playing cards as pictorial or graphic works.” 1 Nimmer § 2.18[H][3]. Recognizing this principle, several circuits have held copyrightable [*27] as an audiovisual work, the “repetitive sequence of a substantial portion of the sights and sounds” of a video game. Stern Elecs., Inc. v. Kaufman, 669 F.2d 852, 856 (2d Cir. 1982); Atari v. North Am., etc., 672 F.2d 607, 615-17 (7th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 880, 74 L. Ed. 2d 145, 103 S. Ct. 176 (1982)

In Atari, the Seventh Circuit noted that although the video at issue was primarily an unprotected game “to at least a limited extent the particular form in which it is expressed (shapes, sizes, colors, sequences, arrangements, and sounds) provides something ‘new or additional over the idea.’” Id. at 617 (citations omitted). The court concluded that while the basic concept underlying a game might be an unprotectable idea, “the audio component and the concrete details of the visual presentation constitute the copyrightable expression of that game ‘idea.’” Id.

In addition to finding that “concrete details of the visual presentation” of a game constitute protectable expression, courts have also warned that triers of fact [*28] should not easily be persuaded that all games constitute unprotectable ideas. In Midway Mfg., for example, the defendant attempted to defend its imitation of the plaintiff’s popular “Galaxian” video game on the basis that “any similarities between its games and [the plaintiff’s] are nonactionable since they result from an allegedly inevitable connection between the expressions and the similarities in the underlying unprotectable ideas.” Midway Mfg., 546 F. Supp. at 148. Data East takes a similar position here, arguing that “the similarities that Capcom purports to find in the Fighter’s History characters stem simply from the fact that Fighter’s History, like every other video game in the genre, uses the same format and draws from the same public domain of stereotyped characters, not because Data East has copied from Capcom.” [Def. Mem. P & A, filed Dec. 1, 1993, at 48: 5-8.] The court in Midway Mfg. rejected this argument. It noted that the defendant’s argument failed as a matter of law because it:

> assumed sub silentio, that the idea of Midway’s Galaxian game actually includes the physical characteristics of the characters involved. If [*29] such reasoning were accepted, a copyright defendant could always avoid liability merely by describing a plaintiff’s work in great detail and then labeling that description the “idea” of plaintiff’s work. The “idea” of any work could always be defined in such detail that the description of the expression would add nothing to the “idea”, thus allowing a defendant to engage in all but verbatim copying. Such a ploy cannot be allowed.

Id. at 148.

In Midway Mfg., the court followed the Ninth Circuit’s admonishment that “the description of the work for the purpose of identifying its idea must be a simple one.” Id. at 148. The court proceeded to identify the idea behind Midway’s Galaxian game as “an outer space video game in which the player controls a rocket ship defending itself against a swarm of computer-controlled attacking aliens who attempt to bomb and collide with the player’s ship.” Id. at 148. Once identified in such appropriately simple terms, the court noted that

> it is clear that Midway’s copyright does not in the least preclude the creation of an entire universe of other space [*30] video games . . . based on the same, unprotected idea. It is also clear that, in expressing its version of the game idea, there was no necessity for [the defendant] to mimic Midway’s expression of this idea which involves such elements as the particular insectile shape of the aliens, their movements, and the musical theme.

Id.

Similarly here, the Street Fighter II work can be described in simple terms. It is a one-on-one fight game that allows players to select from a host of human characters, each with their own unique appearance and fighting style, to do battle using a variety of realistic and “special” or unreal moves and combination attacks. Once described in simple terms, it is clear that Capcom’s copyright does not preclude the development of other one-on-one fight games.

Capcom argues that the idea behind Street Fighter II can be expressed in limitless forms. It notes that under prevailing case law, the greater the range of possible expression of an idea, the greater the scope of copyright protection for that expression. Sid & Marty Krofft, 562 F.2d at 1168.

Furthermore, Capcom maintains that Street Fighter II’s characters and their moves [\*31] are highly individualized and, consequently, constitute a protectable form of expression. It relies on several analogous cases to support its position. See, e.g., Atari, 672 F.2d at 617 (Seventh Circuit found substantial similarity between PAC-MAN characters and the characters in a competitor’s video game.); Midway Mfg., 546 F. Supp. at 146 (Court held that the particular insectile shape of the aliens in Galaxian game was protectable.); Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co. Ltd., 615 F. Supp. 838, 859 (S.D.N.Y. 1985), aff’d 797 F.2d 70 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 987 (1986) (Court held that although the idea behind the game Donkey Kong was not protectable, the distinctive march of the rescuer and the general movement of the characters were protectable forms of expression of that idea.). While the three cases Capcom relies upon provide good support for its position, there is no question that the games involved in those three cases--PAC-MAN, Galaxian and Donkey Kong--were far more fanciful than many of the elements [\*32] presented in Street Fighter II.

Data East rejects Capcom’s assertion that the Street Fighter II characters are “unique and highly individualized.” Rather, it insists that the Street Fighter II characters at issue are stereotypical figures, wholly unoriginal to Capcom, and “well known throughout decades of popular culture.” [Def. Mem. P & A, at 22: 9.] Because the characters are not original to Capcom, Data East maintains that this Court cannot afford them copyright protection. In addition, it posits that most of the characters’ moves are not protectable because, under the merger doctrine, they constitute simple ideas such as punches and kicks. To the extent that some of the special moves in Street Fighter II are more fanciful and, consequently, eligible for protection, Data East maintains that the special moves in Fighter’s History are not similar because they differ in expressive detail.

A detailed analysis of the Street Fighter II characters and their Fighter’s History counterparts can be found in the appendix to this opinion. At the outset, however, it is useful to eliminate as unoriginal several special moves in Street Fighter II for which Capcom seeks protection. These moves [*33] are: (1) Sagat’s “tiger knee” which is a common kickboxing move; (2) E. Honda’s “knee bash” which is a common wrestling move; (3) Vega’s mid-air throw which is a basic fight maneuver; (4) Vega’s floor slide which again is a basic fight maneuver; (5) Balrog’s “dashing punch” which is a simple punch; (6) Zangief’s “backwards throw”; and (7) Zangief’s “body leap” both of which are common wrestling moves. [^4]

[^4]: Indeed, analogs of these last two moves of Zangief can be found in the American Technos game “WWF Superstars”, a video game that preceded the release of Street Fighter II. [Pl.’s Videotape No. 2, filed Jan. 5, 1994, excerpts of “WWF Superstars.”]

All of these moves are unoriginal to Capoom and contain little or no expressive detail above the basic idea that they represent. The Ninth Circuit has held that a video game developer may not receive protection for “elements of expression that necessarily follow from an idea, or to ‘scenes-a-faire,’ i.e., expressions that are ‘as a practical matter, indispensable or at [*34] least standard in the treatment of a given [idea].’” Data East, 862 F.2d at 208 (quoting Aliotti, 831 F.2d at 901). The adherence of these seven moves to basic martial arts disciplines precludes wholly fanciful expression. One consequence of this adherence is that the moves constitute unprotectable expression. As a result of the elimination of these moves, the total number of special moves at issue is reduced to twenty.

In addition, two of the eight Street Fighter II characters at issue must also be eliminated from the core of protectable expression because there are no Fighter’s History characters similar to them. Neither E. Honda nor Vega have an analogous mate in Fighter’s History. Although Capcom maintains that Jean from Fighter’s History closely resembles Vega because they are both “tall, slender fighters of European origin and glamorous appearance who wear striped pants and bands around [their] forearms,” an inspection of the two characters reveals that they are not similar. [Decl. of David Winstead, filed Sept. 27, 1993, at 26: 3-5.] Vega’s two most distinguishing features are his mask and long mechanical claw. Both [*35] of these features are reminiscent of two immensely popular horror film characters, Jason and Freddy Krueger. Jean shares neither of these distinguishing features. In addition, Vega and Jean’s fighting styles are dissimilar with the exception of the two common moves, the floor slide and air throw, that have already been removed from the analysis. The elimination of E. Honda and Vega reduces the number of characters at issue to six.

Having completed a detailed analytic dissection of the alleged similarities, the Court finds that of the eight pairs of characters and twenty-seven special moves at issue, three characters and five special moves in Fighter’s History are similar to protectable characters and special moves in Street Fighter II. These figures must be cast against the fact that Street Fighter II has a total universe of twelve characters and six hundred and fifty moves. Capcom concedes, as it must, that the vast majority of the moves are unprotectable because they are commonplace kicks and punches. Because all of the fighters in Street Fighter II are adherents to one or more of the martial arts disciplines, the bulk of their fight moves are similarly derived from those disciplines. [*36] 

### b. Application of the Intrinsic Test

Under the Sid & Marty Krofft / Brown Bag test, once all the unprotected similarities and those elements that are not similar as a matter of law have been filtered out through analytic dissection, the remaining protectable expression in the plaintiff’s video is compared to corresponding expression in the defendant’s video in a subjective analysis of similarity. Ordinarily the standard of similarity to be applied to adjudicate infringement is a standard of “substantial similarity.” Brown Bag, 960 F.2d at 1472. Where the alleged similarities in a plaintiff’s work consists primarily of elements that are unprotectable, or are capable of only a narrow range of expression, then a court must apply a “virtual identity standard” when comparing the plaintiff’s work with the challenged one. See Apple Computer, 821 F. Supp. at 623-25; Harper House, Inc. v Thomas Nelson, Inc., 889 F.2d 197, 205 (9th Cir. 1989) (Court held that plaintiff’s original compilation of largely unprotectable features was entitled only to limited copyright protection).

It is [*37] indisputable that Street Fighter II is largely comprised of unprotectable elements. The vast majority of the moves--over 650 of them--are unprotectable, commonplace punches and kicks. In addition, the Court finds that even a majority of the moves that are allegedly special and fanciful are ultimately unprotectable either because they are unoriginal scenes-a-faire or have not actually been copied by Data East. As a result, the virtual identity standard is the appropriate standard for the Court to apply in assessing the subjective similarity between the two games.

The subjective determination involved in the intrinsic test employs a reasonable person standard and examines the works for similarity in “total concept and feel.” Shaw v. Lindheim, 919 F.2d 1353, 1357 (9th Cir. 1990); see also Data East, 862 F.2d at 208 (The intrinsic test “is a subjective test which depends on the response of the ordinary person.”). The perspective is that of the relevant audience which in the case of video games is a discerning teenager, approximately seventeen years old. See Data East, 862 F.2d at 210.

Applying [*38] the virtual identity standard, the Court finds that Data East has not copied the core, protectable expression in Street Fighter II. Although the Court has concluded that three Fighter’s History characters--Matlok, Feilin and Ray, are similar to Guile, Chun Li and Ken in Street Fighter II, the characters are not virtually identical and Data East certainly has not bodily appropriated them for use in its game.

For example, although Guile and Matlok both have spiky hair and wear similar clothing, they are not identical to one another. Guile is a military figure who wears military garb and has a military base as his home stage. Matlok is a “punkrocker” whose characterization is underscored by his tough appearance and “breakdance” type moves. Their magic projectiles, while similar in appearance, are not identical. In keeping with his personality, Matlok throws a spinning compact disc, the form of which is apparent in some video sequences. Guile, on the other hand, throws a Ch’i mental energy ball and shouts “sonic boom” upon its release. This is in keeping with his military persona.

Chun Li and Feilin also have some significant differences in appearance. Although they are both Asian women, [*39] their costumes are dissimilar and they have no common fight moves. They are not virtually identical to one another.

Ken and Ray also do not satisfy the virtual identity standard. Although they share a strong physical resemblance to one another, their appearances are not identical and their fighting styles are dissimilar. Ray’s “Big Tornado”, while similar in color to Ken’s projectile, has the distinct shape of a tornado cloud which differentiates it from Ken’s special move.

Finally, the two special moves assigned to nonanalogous characters--Chun Li’s head stomp and E. Honda’s 100 hand slap--that the Court found protectable under the extrinsic test also have not been bodily appropriated by Data East for use in Fighter’s History. Matlok’s “dancing head press”, which is similar to Chun Li’s maneuver, is executed in a substantially different manner. Matlok performs an airborne somersault before landing on his opponent’s head with two feet, not one like Chun Li. In addition, unlike Chun Li who proceeds over her opponent and lands on the opposite side of the screen from where she started, Matlok can continue forward or bounce backward to the place where he began his move. In addition, although [*40] Jean’s “needle shower” is similar to E. Honda’s “100 hand slap,” the move is executed in a somewhat different manner and does not appear virtually identical to the viewer.

Even if the Court were to apply the more lenient substantial similarity standard, its conclusion would be the same. The physical appearances and fight moves of the few characters at issue are expressed in sufficiently different manners in the two games to preclude a finding of substantial similarity.

Applying the Ninth Circuit standard for granting a preliminary injunction to the facts infra, Capcom has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits or even serious questions concerning the merits. As set forth in the detailed analysis contained in the appendix, very few of the characters and moves in Street Fighter II are copyrightable and those that are have not been copied by Data East. Furthermore, the balance of hardships, far from tipping sharply in Capcom’s favor, may tip slightly in respondent’s favor. In connection with this motion, Data East agreed to temporarily suspend its sales and promotion of Fighter’s History. As such, it has lost valuable floor space in arcades and retail establishments. [*41] Given the severe competition for such space, Data East will face great difficulty in regaining marketing opportunities if the sales ban is continued pending a trial on the merits. In contrast, should Capcom prevail on its copyright claim at trial, it will be able to recoup its damages in the form of Data East’s interim profits on Fighter’s History.

In the end, Data East has not captured in Fighter’s History the “total concept and feel” of the protectable expression in Street Fighter II. Rather, the similarities that result between the two games stem from Data East’s emulation of the unprotectable, commonplace features of Street Fighter II, such as its stereotypical fight characters and its reliance on unoriginal fighting techniques derived from the martial arts. The advantage Capcom gained in relying on these stock characters and standard moves is that they are immediately recognizable and familiar to the player. One of the risks consequent to this tactic, however, is that much of Street Fighter II is left unprotectable from competitors’ simulations.

To support its contention that all one-on-one fight games do not have to appear the same, Capcom presented the Court with excerpts from [*42] Mortal Kombat, one of Street Fighter II’s greatest rivals. Although the excerpts confirm Capcom’s position that all fight video games do not have to look the same, the excerpts also reveal how much more original and creative Mortal Kombat is in comparison to Street Fighter II. The developers of the game eschewed reliance on stereotypes and instead created truly unique characters such as Sub-Zero and Scorpion. In addition, the fighting styles of the Mortal Kombat’s characters are equally original. In the end, Mortal Kombat reveals the lack of originality in Street Fighter II.

Street Fighter II and Fighter’s History bear more similarities than Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat because they contain a greater percentage of reality based moves that are faithful to one or more of the martial arts disciplines and characters drawn largely from a pool of stereotyped human fighters. As a result, Capcom has left room for its competitors to emulate large portions of its game because many of its elements are not protectable. Capcom cannot now withdraw from the public domain ideas and standardized expression. It also cannot be heard to argue that two projectiles are similar even though they differ [*43] in size, shape and color. To do so would be commensurate to awarding Capcom a monopoly over a range of characters and moves that it did not create. It would also allow Capcom to lay proprietary claim to all reality based fight games featuring human characters. Copyright law affords no such protection.

For the reasons discussed at length above, Capcom has failed to raise serious questions concerning the merits of its copyright claim or to demonstrate that the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor as required by the Ninth Circuit to warrant the issuance of a preliminary injunction.

Accordingly,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Capcom’s motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED.

Dated: March 16, 1994.

## APPENDIX

### Street Fighter II’s Sagat v. Fighter’s History’s Samchay

The first pair of allegedly similar characters is Street Fighter II’s Sagat and Fighter’s History’s Samchay. The two characters share physical similarities. These similarities, however, stem from the fact that both fighters are Thai kickboxers clad in traditional kickboxer attire--striped boxer shorts and wrist wrappings. Capcom cannot obtain copyright [*44] protection for the unoriginal portrayal of a stereotyped character. See, e.g., Apple Computer, 799 F. Supp. at 1021. In addition, Data East correctly points out that the actual expressive details of the icon vary between the two games, such as the color of the boxer shorts, hairstyle, etc.

Capcom alleges that Sagat and Samchay share analogous special moves. Upon inspection, however, these moves are not similar. First, Capcom alleges that Samchay’s fireball is a copy of Sagat’s “Tiger Shot.” Both of these moves involve magic projectiles. The idea of a fight character throwing a projectile, however, is not original to Capcom. For example, Konami produced a video game in 1986 in which a projectile was part of the fighter’s arsenal. [^5] In addition, Data East has submitted excerpts from a popular Japanese comic book in which the character releases a magic fireball to stun his opponent. [Def.’s Exhibits Volume II, filed Dec. 1, 1993, at 16.] Finally, Mortal Kombat and Samurai Shodown, two games which Capcom has offered as examples of non-infringing fight videos, both rely heavily on magic projectiles to stock their characters’ arsenals. Thus, the underlying [*45] idea of a projectile is not protectable because it is not original to Capcom.


[^5]: Capcom correctly asserts that the projectile featured in the Konami game is primitive in comparison with those at issue in the present motion. The primitive nature of the projectile was the result of then existing technological constraints and does not alter the fact that the use of projectiles predated the release of Street Fighter II.

The expressive details of a particular projectile, however, are eligible for copyright protection. See, e.g., Atari, 672 F.2d at 617 (Court found that although the idea of the game was not protectable, the particular form in which it was expressed was because it “provides something ‘new or additional over the idea.’”) At this level of abstraction, however, the two projectiles at issue differ. Sagat’s “tiger shot” is a bright orange, talon-shaped figure. Samchay’s “fireball” is a larger, green cloud, lacking a distinct shape. The two projectiles are not similar. For this same [*46] reason, the two characters’ combination moves, in which their projectiles are combined with a simple jab, are also not similar.

Next, Capcom maintains that Samchay’s flying knee combination is a copy of Sagat’s “tiger knee” combination. A combination is a rapid sequence of moves, which, if executed properly cannot be blocked once the first element in the sequence connects with the fighter’s opponent. Both sides provided detailed testimony regarding the existence of combination moves in the two games and their strategic importance. Both sides agree that Street Fighter II contains special, preprogrammed combination attacks in its computer program. Only those combination attacks that have been programmed into the computer are recognized by Street Fighter II. In contrast, Fighter’s History does not contain any preprogrammed combination moves. Rather, the player can link together any combination of individual moves to create a unique combination. Like Street Fighter II, the combination moves in Fighter’s History have a special strategic affect because if executed properly, the first element will stun the fighter’s opponent and leave him defenseless against the remaining elements. [^6] [*47] Both sides agreed that the combination attacks that are preprogrammed into the Street Fighter II system will also work in Fighter’s History.

[^6]: The use of a “stun” factor is original to neither Capcom nor Data East. Rather idea of a stun factor was first used by Technos Japan, another game developer, in its game “Double Dragon” in 1987. [Supp. Decl. of Ryoji Minagawa, filed Jan. 12, 1994, P 6.]

Sagat’s “tiger knee” combination consists of a high kick to his opponent’s midsection, followed by a low kick to the legs and ending with a “tiger knee” to the chest. The Court has already determined that the “tiger knee” element is a simple Thai kickboxing move that is not protectable. Similarly, the other two elements of the combination--the high kick and low kick--are also simple fight moves, unoriginal to Capcom. Indeed, the kicks featured in Sagat’s “tiger knee” combination can be found in Data East’s Karate Champ game which preceded Street Fighter II. [Def.’s Exhibits Volume IV, filed Dec. 1, 1993, at 30a-c; 31a-c & 32a-c.] [*48] Because the individual elements of the combination are not protectable, Capcom cannot prevent players of Fighter’s History from linking the three moves together.

### Street Fighter II’s Ryu v. Fighter’s History’s Mizoguchi

The next pair of corresponding characters is Street Fighter II’s Ryu and Fighter’s History’s Mizoguchi. Both fighters are karate experts. Ryu wears traditional karate robes secured with a black belt, while Mizoguchi is bare chested and dons karate-style baggy pants. Although Capcom alleges that Data East copied Ryu in creating Mizoguchi, an inspection of the two characters reveals that they represent different expressions of the same stereotype--a karate fighter. Precursors to Ryu can be found in Marvel comic book characters. [Def.’s Exhibits Volume III at 35 & 36.] Capcom cannot claim a stereotype for its exclusive use. The actual expressive details of the stereotype, the part that is protectable, vary greatly.

The two characters perform some similar moves. For example, both fighters throw magic projectiles. As noted above, however, Capcom cannot protect the idea of a projectile. In addition, upon examination, the expressive form of the two projectiles is very [*49] different.

Mizoguchi’s “tiger bazooka” is a bright orange, flamelike object with the image of a tiger’s profile etched in the center. Ryu’s fireball is round, blue object with an image of his gloved fists appearing at the outer edge. The color, shape and imagery of the two projectiles, which differ greatly, is what separates their expression from the underlying, unprotectable idea. If the Court were to find these two projectiles to be similar, it would in effect be placing the use of magic projectiles off limits to all other video game producers. Capcom’s own expert consultant, David Winstead, conceded this during cross-examination. He noted that the only way for game developers to differentiate Ch’i energy projectiles was to use different hologram images to represent the fighter’s mental energy. He agreed that Ryu’s and Mizoguchi’s Ch’i energy projectiles were represented by very different visual images.

Next, both Ryu and Mizoguchi have flying kick maneuvers in which they sail through the air and kick their opponents one or more times. Once again, however, these two moves are not similar. Ryu’s repeated kick involves him extending his right leg parallel to the ground and then spinning [*50] towards his opponent until he strikes a blow. Mizoguchi simply flies through the air feet-first towards his opponent, alternately kicking his legs until he makes contact. The moves do not look similar, other than the fact that they both emulate stereotypical karate moves.

### Street Fighter II’s Zangief v. Fighter’s History’s Marstorius

The third pair of combatants is Street Fighter II’s Zangief and Fighter’s History’s Marstorius. Both fighters are wrestlers, a stereotypical fight character. The images selected by Capcom and Data East to express this icon, however, differ. Zangief is a Russian strongman. He wears bright red briefs and wristbands and has a closely cropped brown “mohawk” and beard. Marstorius, on the other hand, has the appearance of a Roman gladiator. He wears a leather chest-protector and boots, a skirt-like cloth around his hips and sports long shaggy hair and a full beard. He resembles the popular movie character Conan the Barbarian. The only similarities between Zangief and Marstorius result from the fact that at their core they are both stereotypical wrestlers. Capcom cannot appropriate this icon for its exclusive use. See Apple Computer, 799 F. Supp. at 1021 [*51] (Scenes-a-faire doctrine includes stock characters and stereotyped expression.). Once again, the actual expressive details of the stereotype vary greatly. Capcom’s David Winstead agree with this conclusion during cross-examination.

Zangief and Marstorius perform several similar moves. The Court concludes, however, that these moves are standard wrestling moves, unoriginal to Capcom. The image of Zangief’s body leap is clearly a copy of the “body slam” maneuver common to wrestlers, in which they propel themselves into the ropes encasing the wrestling ring and then “slam” themselves onto their opponent. Capcom cannot now remove this move from the public domain by claiming it is within the scope of its copyright.

### Street Fighter II’s Chun Li v. Fighter’s History’s Feilin

The next analogous pair of fighters is Street Fighter II’s Chun Li and Fighter’s History’s Feilin. Although the two characters wear different clothes and have different fighting styles, the fact remains that the two are both female Chinese fighters. Given the legion of fight characters from which Data East had to chose its characters for Fighter’s History, the fact that it also selected a female Chinese fighter is [*52] troublesome to the Court. This fact alone is reason to find similarity between the two characters. 7

7 Although the Court finds that Chun Li is an original character deserving of copyright protection and that Feilin is similar to her, as noted above in the opinion, under the subjective assessment of similarity performed as part of the intrinsic test, the Court finds that the two characters are not virtually identical. The same conclusion is true of the next two pairs of characters--Ken and Ray, and Guile and Matlok. Although the Court finds that Street Fighter Ii’s Ken and Guile are original and copyrightable and that Fighter’s History has two physically similar characters in Ray and Matlok, the Court has previously concluded that, under the intrinsic test, the characters are not virtually identical to their Street Fighter II counterparts.

### Street Fighter II’s Ken v. Fighter’s History’s Ray

The fifth pair of characters is Street Fighter II’s Ken and Fighter’s History’s Ray. The two characters share a similar physical [*53] appearance. Both have a mop of blond hair, dark, black circles around their eyes and black bands around their wrists. Each wears a set of monochromatic clothing--one in red, the other in blue. Overall, their physical appearances are similar given the universe of characters available to Data East. In addition, Ray’s “tornado” projectile is a bluish, pulsing spiral that looks similar to Ken’s bluish colored “fireball.”

### Street Fighter II’s Guile v. Fighter’s History’s Matlok

The final pair of fighters is Street Fighter II’s Guile and Fighter’s History’s Matlok. Guile and Matlok share a similar physical appearance. Both are muscle bound men with spiky blond hair. Both wear green fatigues and army boots. Despite some differences in articles of clothing and hair style, the two combatants are reminiscent of one another. The physical similarity between the two characters is bolstered by the fact that they share similar fighting styles.

For example, Matlok’s “spinning CD” move is similar in appearance to Guile’s “sonic boom.” In both moves, the characters release a spinning, blade-like projectile that is white in color. While Data East is correct when it underscores that Matlok is throwing [*54] an object--a compact disc, and Guile is releasing a Ch’i energy ball--the image created by the two spheres is similar. In addition, the two characters share similar combination moves. Guile’s sonic boom combination involves Guile jumping into the air and striking his opponent with a punch, followed by a quick jab as he lands on the ground and a release of a sonic boom projectile. Matlok has a similar combination move that combines the same three elements and ends with him releasing his spinning CD. While the punch and jab elements are unprotectable common moves, the presence of the projectiles gives the two moves a similar appearance.

Finally, both Guile and Matlok have a flying kick maneuver, but these moves are dissimilar. Guile kicks his opponent with his right leg and then flips backward. Matlok flips forward and strikes his opponent with his left leg before landing. The only feature common to both is the streak of white left by the fighter’s leg after the move is executed. This streak is commonly used by video game designers to designate motion.

### Various Special Moves

In addition to the analogous pairs of fighters between the two games, Capcom alleges that several of Fighter’s [*55] History’s characters execute special moves that are similar to moves performed by Street Fighter II characters who are not physically analogous.

### Guile’s Flashkick v. Feilin’s Flashpunch

First, Capcom maintains that Street Fighter II’s Guile flashkick and Fighter’s History Feilin’s flashpunch are similar. On examination, these two moves appear somewhat similar to the extent that they each involve a spinning blow, but the fact that the move has been assigned to a nonanalogous character, that Feilin spins from left to right rather than front to back, and that she executes her move with a punch rather than a kick renders it more different than similar. During his testimony, Capcom’s expert consultant agreed that the two moves looked different. The opposite conclusion would award Capcom exclusive use of spinning kicks and punches. The same is true of Guile’s flashkick combination and Feilin’s flashpunch combination.

### Ryu’s Fireball v. Feilin’s Praying Mantis Punch

Next, Capcom argues that Data East has assigned Ryu’s fireball and fireball combination to Fighter’s History Feilin. Feilin’s magic projectile is called the Praying Mantis punch and is green in color with a stylized image [*56] of a praying mantis. The expressive details of her magic projectile are entirely different from Ryu’s fireball which is a round blue cloud containing an image of Ryu’s hands and wristbands. The differences between their projectiles also differentiate the two combination moves at issue which feature the projectiles as the central element with the addition of a simple kick.

### Guile’s Sonic Boom v. Jean’s Bal Rose

For these same reasons, the Court is not persuaded by Capcom’s argument that Data East has assigned Guile’s sonic boom to Fighter’s History’s Jean’s “Bal Rose” move. Once again, the expressive details of the two projectiles are entirely different and the underlying idea of a projectile is not protectable.

### Vega’s Tumbling Claw v. Ryoko’s Rolling Attack

Next, Capcom alleges that Data East has assigned Vega’s tumbling claw attack to Ryoko. Upon inspection, however, these two moves are not similar other than the fact that each contains a rolling element. Vega’s attack involves him executing a forward tumblesault and then lunging forward to stab his opponent with his mechanical claw. Ryoko simply performs a common karate move in which he rolls sideways into his opponent. Ryoko’s [*57] move does not contain a jabbing element.

### Zangief’s Pile Driver v. Ryoko’s Head Slam

Capcom further posits that Ryoko’s spinning head slam is a copy of Street Fighter II’s Zangief’s spinning pile driver. The Court disagrees. To begin with, the “pile driver” is a common wrestling move unoriginal to Capcom. Capcom has enhanced the move by adding an airborne, spinning element. Ryoko’s attack also contains an element in which he spins in the air while entangled with his opponent, but otherwise the attack is different and more reminiscent of a karate move than of Zangief’s wrestling technique.

### Chun Li Spinning Bird Kick v. Matlok Hurricane Kick

Capcom next alleges that Chun Li’s spinning bird kick has been appropriated by Date East and used as the basis for Matlok’s hurricane kick. The two moves are not similar. Matlok’s hurricane kick is a clear copy of a common breakdancing move in which he rolls onto his back into a headstand, splits his legs and kicks his opponent. The move is humanly possible and, in fact, was performed on many city streets when breakdancing was popular. Chun Li’s spinning bird kick is humanly impossible; she flips upside down, levitates and then spins in mid-air [*58] towards her opponent with her legs split so that their movement resembles the blades of a helicopter. Although each character must split his or her legs to execute the move, the two moves are not similar.

### Chun Li’s Head Stomp v. Matlok’s Head Stomp

### E. Honda’s 100 Hand Slap v. Jean’s Fast Hands

Finally, there are two special moves that are similar in appearance and execution. First, Matlok’s head stomp is similar to Chun Li’s head stomp, and Jean’s “fast hands” move resembles Street Fighter II’s E. Honda’s “100 hand slap.” Given that these special moves are humanly impossible and their design is limited only by the developer’s own imagination, their appearance in Fighter’s History cannot simply be dismissed as a coincidence.
