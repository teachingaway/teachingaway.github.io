## <a href='/litigation/'>Litigation</a> 

We litigate complex contract and intellectual property disputes, including patent troll defense. We also help enforce legitimate IP rights in trade secret disputes, trademark appeals at the USPTO and litigation in federal court. Our litigation practice prioritizes early stage and cost effective litigation tools that settle disputes before incurring more substantial costs.
