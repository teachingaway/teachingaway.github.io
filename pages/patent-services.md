# Utility Patent Applications

A utility patent secures exclusive rights to make, sell and import a technology in the United States for a period of 20 years after the application date. 

Here are some ballpark cost estimates to prepare and file utility patent applications

Estimaged Cost | Type of Application
- | - 
$5,000 - $8,000 | mechanical patent application of average complexity
$7,500- $10,000 | software patent application of average complexity

The total patent application costs depend on a number of factors. If you provide a detailed, well organized invention disclosure, the application process will require less drafting time from the patent attorney, and will result in lower costs to you.

## Expedited Patent Applications

When time is of the essence, we can press the US Patent Office to move faster (for a fee). While patents generally take 2-3 years for approval, I've seen examiners approve patents in as little as **9 months**.

# Provisional Patent Applications

A provisional patent application is a temporary patent application that nails down a filing date at the Patent Office. If an inventor files a full utility patent application within 1 year after the provisional, the later full application will be treated as though it was filed on the date of the earlier provisional application. 

There are several benefits. Its often cheaper to file a provisional application than prepare a complete patent application. This allows an inventor to delay some legal costs for a year, and use this year to test the market for the new technology.

# Design Patent Applications

Design patents protect the "ornamental appearance" of a product. They can protect industrial design and physical products, as well as software user interface designs and fonts. 

Cost - To file a design patent, estimate $380 in USPTO fees and about $1,000 in legal fees. Then tack on another $280 fee when the patent issues (about a year after filing). For several related design patents, the legal fees per patent will decrease.
