# Patent Applications and Patent Prosecution 

## Utility Patent Applications

A utility patent secures exclusive rights to make, sell and import a technology in the United States for a period of 20 years after the application date. A small portfolio of related patents can be a potent business tool. Here are some ballpark cost estimates to prepare and file utility patent applications

Estimaged Cost | Type of Application
- | - 
$5,000 - $8,000 | mechanical patent application of average complexity
$7,500- $10,000 | software patent application of average complexity

The total patent application costs depend on a number of factors. If you provide a detailed, well organized invention disclosure, the application process will require less drafting time from the patent attorney, and will result in lower costs to you. 

## Expedited Patent Applications

When time is of the essence, we can press the US Patent Office to move faster (for a fee). While patents generally take 2-3 years for approval, I've seen examiners approve patents in as little as **9 months**. 

A "Prioritized Examination" expedites the patent process to about 1 year. While a prioritized application requires the inventor to abide by certain limitations, they are not particularly onerous, especially if speed is critical. The additional "small entity" filing fee is generally $2,000 (reduced to $1,000 for "micro-entities").  

Starting the patent process with a "PCT" application can also expedite the process. Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") refers to a type of international patent process that tends to move much faster than a straight US utility patent. The first reply to a PCT application tends to come in 3 or 4 months, as opposed to 15-18 months for a straight US Utility patent. A positive PCT response (called a "search report") is a particularly useful tool for early stage companies raising venture capital.

## Provisional Patent Applications

A provisional patent application is a temporary patent application that nails down an early "filing date" at the Patent Office. If an inventor files a full non-provisional utility patent application within 1 year after the provisional, the later full application will be treated as though filed on the provisional's earlier date. 

Provisional applications provide several benefits. Its often cheaper to file a provisional application than prepare a complete patent application. This allows an inventor to delay a portion of the legal costs for a year, and use this year to test the market for the new technology. Provisionals are not public, and will only be published if they are used to support a utility patent application. 

**Thorough Provisionals.** We recommend filing thorough provisional patent applications. A thoroughly drafted provisional will not require major modification at the full non-utility patent stage. This reduces the cost of the non-provisional, and also reduces the risk that the provisional will be "non-enabling." The cost for a thorough provisional application tends to be about 75% of filing the full non-provisional utility patent application. 

**Shortform Provisional**. For about $2,000, we can take your invention disclosure, make some basic edits and adjustments, and file it as a provisional patent application. 

**Unedited Provisional**. For about $1,000, we can file your invention disclosure as a provisional patent application. This does not include any editing or review of the technology disclosure. Although this can be a cost-efficient mechanism for securing an early "filing date", there is a substantial risk that an unedited provisional application will be "non-enabling" when it comes time to file the full non-provisional utility patent application.

## Design Patent Applications

[Design patents](/design-patent-law/) protect the "ornamental appearance" of a product. They can protect industrial design and physical products, as well as software user interface designs and fonts. 

**Cost**. Estimate $380 in USPTO fees and about $1,000 in legal fees to file a US design patent application. There is an additional $280 "issue fee" due when the patent issues (about a year after filing), and a few hours of additional legal work may be required to adjust and finalize the design patent. For clients filing several related design patents, we offer discounted rates. 

Many types of technology can benefit from both design and utility patents. For example, anyone developing technology with an innovative user interface should consider both utility and design patents.

## Appealing Patent Examiner Rejections: Ex Parte Appeals

Patent examiner's are generally smart people, but they work under intense time pressures, and can sometimes make mistakes. When they do, the mistake can often be appealed to the PTAB. We try to avoid this scenario when possible, because the PTAB often takes years to issue a decision on an Ex Parte appeal. However, sometimes an appeal is necessary.

## International and "PCT" Patent Applications

The PCT process involves slightly higher up-front costs, but speeds up the patent process and reduces long run patent management costs. 

PCT applications tend to move faster than US utility patent applications. Once filed, a PCT examiner issues a "search report" in about 3-4 months. If the PCT examiner doesn't find any problematic prior art, the search report can be taken to various national patent offices (including the USPTO), where the PCT report will be highly persuasive, and the patent application often approved without further argument from the national-stage patent examiner. 

Foreign patent filings can be expensive. Ballpark around $5,000 per application per country. The "Patent Cooperation Treaty" or PCT is a cost effective system for *starting* the international patent process, and delaying some of the "national stage" (per country) fees for up to 30 months. 


## National Stage U.S. Patent Prosecution

We help file the United States "national stage" applications for for PCT applications, including amending claims to comply with local United States patent law.

# Transactional Patent Work 


## Patent Due Diligence

We review patent portfolios for Venture Capital Funds and small M&A deals. This may involve checking for proper ownership and assignment documents, reviewing claims for quality drafting, reviewing patent opinions, inbound or outbound license agreements and any patent litigation, whether ongoing or settled. 

- - - 


## Patent Opinions

We review patents and technology and issue actionable legal opinions to guide business decisions. In addition to careful legal analysis, our reports are carefully organized and summarized in plain language. 


### Patentability Opinions 

A patentability opinion reviews a new technology and identifies the components that are likely to be patentable. We first review the technology for "patentable subject matter" - whether it contains the type of technology that can be patented. We can also analyze a limited field of prior art documents, and determine whether they would likely block a new patent for your technology (that is, whether your technology is "novel" and "non-obvious" in view of the prior art documents). 

**Prior Art Search.** A full patentability opinion would include a careful prior art search and analysis of the results. However, such a search can be slow, expensive, and inconclusive. Instead, we often recommend "hiring" the patent office to do the search (either the USPTO or the PCT office). This is cheaper and more conclusive, but the results (positive or negative) are likely to become public record. 


### Defensive Opinions: Invalidity and Non-Infringement

If you receive a demand letter from a patent owner, or someone requests a license fee for a technology you developed in-house, you may want to obtain an "invalidity" and/or "non-infringement" opinion on the third-party patent. 

An "**invalidity**" opinion tests the strength of the third-party patent. Does it meet the requirements for patentability? Is there prior art that renders it obvious? 

A "**non-infringement**" opinion compares the "claims" of the third-party patent to the technology you are using, and gauges whether you are likely to be infringing. 

Legal opinions rarely provide conclusive certainty because patent analysis often turns on subjective issues where reasonable people can differ. However, patent opinions can help *reduce uncertainty* more carefully define legal risks.

## Patent Licensing and Technology Transfer

We counsel clients in patent licensing deals, and technology transfer arrangements, including alternative patent licensing arrangements can be used to attract top engineering talent. We frequently discuss the Defensive Patent License, Twitter's IPA, and Google's "License on Transfer." Where  engineering talent is a higher priority than proprietary technology, these new arrangements can be effective tools to bolster a companies cache with engineers, while simultaneously preventing patent trolls from ever acquiring the patents. 


- - - 

## Patent Portfolio Management

We can help optimize patent portfolios, review deadlines, pay maintenance fees, and ensure that proper assignment and ownership documents have been filed at the USPTO. 

To improve cost efficiency, we can help review old patents and trim away intellectual property that is no longer aligned with business goals. This can  substantially reduce maintenance fees and management costs.

# Invalidating Patents at the USPTO

The Patent Trial and Appeal Board ("PTAB") is an administrative court within the USPTO. The PTAB offers fast and inexpensive tools for invalidating patents. 

In all of these PTAB proceedings, the judge will be a patent law specialist, and will likely have an engineering or science background. This can be an advantage over federal court, where judges are generalists who adjudicate cases dealing with every type of civil and criminal law, and rarely have a science background.


## Inter Partes Review: Invalidate Patents Based on Prior Art

An IPR can invalidate and cancel a patent on the basis of prior art in patents or printed publications. IPR is often preferable to federal court litigation, for several reasons. 

- Speed. An IPR goes to trial within 6 months, and the PTAB must issue its decision within 1 year.  

- Cost-Effective. While there is a substantial filing fee ($23,000), the legal fees are much lower than litigation. An IPR can often be completed for less than $150,000 total. Compare this to federal court, where patent litigation often costs more than $500,000 just to get through the discovery phase. 

- No Presumption of Validity.  In federal court, patents are presumed valid. 35 USC §282.  This gives plaintiff an advantage from the outset. In an IPR, however, there is no presumption that the patent is valid. The parties start an IPR on equal footing. 

- Lower Burden of Proof. In federal court, the defendant needs to present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity. [*Microsoft Corp. v. i4i*, 131 S.Ct. 2238, 2242 (2011)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18084304855984673909). In an IPR, a patent can be invalidated by a mere "preponderance of the evidence." [35 USC §316(e)](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/316). 

- Broad Claim Interpretation. In federal court, patent claims are interpreted according to their "ordinary and customary meaning."  At an IPR, claims are interpreted according to their "broadest reasonable construction." When claims are interpreted broadly, it is easier to invalidate them with prior art. 

- Time Pressure on Patent Owner. Even if the parties settle, the PTAB may decide to continue the proceeding on its own, and even invalidate the patent. The farther along the IPR moves, the more likely the PTAB is to continue it, even after a settlement. This gives patent owners an incentive to settle early, on terms favorable to the petitioner (the party challenging the patent's validity).

**Risks**. There is some "estoppel" risk involved in an IPR. A party that challenges a patent in an IPR and loses will not be able to challenge that patent again in federal court on any invalidity grounds that it asserted or "reasonably could have asserted" in the IPR. Put differently, a patent that survives an IPR becomes stronger.


## Covered Business Method Review: Invalidating Financial Patents 

Patents related to financial products and services are subject to a procedure called "Covered Business Method Review" ("CBM"). If you have been accused of infringing a finance-related patent (whether in a lawsuit or cease-and-desist letter), consider filing a CBM in reply. 

CBM is fast, often reaching a findal decision within 12-18 months. This is about half the time it would take in most federal courts.  CBM is also substantially cheaper than federal court. 

There is less "estoppel" risk in a CBM than in other PTAB proceedings. A party that loses a CBM cannot go to federal court to reargue the invalidity grounds that it *actually asserted* at the CBM. In other PTAB proceedings, the losing party will be estopped from later asserting invalidity arguments that "reasonably could have been" asserted at the PTAB.  



## Post Grant Review: Invalidating Recently Issued Patents 

Patents that have been issued within the last 9 months are subject to the "Post Grant Review" procedure. In a PGR, a patent can be invalidated based on *any grounds*. In an inter-partes review, a patent can only be invalidated based on prior art. 

There is some "estoppel" risk involved in a PGR. A party that files a PGR and loses will not be able to argue invalidity again in federal court on any grounds that it "reasonably could have asserted" at the PGR. Since the PGR allows for more types of invalidity arguments than an IPR, there is the possibility of broader estoppel. 

  
## Ex Parte Reexamination: Ask the Patent Office to Double-Check 

Anyone can ask the Patent Office to reexamine a patent at any time. The Patent Office will review the patent for invalidity based on prior art in patents or printed publications. The review will only take place if the petition presents a "substantial new question of patentability." If the Patent Office grants the petition, the review is ex parte - the petition does not have an opportunity to present arguments. More details are described in [MPEP 2209](/mpep/s2209.html).

# Patent Litigation

We litigate patent disputes in federal court in the Southern District of NY (Manhattan) and the Eastern District of NY (Brooklyn). Our litigation services are cost-effective, and appropriate for small and medium-size litigation. For more complicated patent litigation, we can help connect clients with larger law firms. 

- - - 

## Patent Enforcement

If you believe a competitor is infringing your patent, we can help investigate the status of your patent and the competitor's infringing technology. After careful due diligence, we can send a demand letter and negotiate a license deal or settlement agreement. If that fails, we litigate patent disputes in federal court.

## Patent Troll Defense in Federal Court

We help defend startups against frivolous patent troll claims. Since the Supreme Court changed the rules of the game in Summer 2014, defendants have been winning far more cases against non-practicing patent entities. Courts are now far more willing to force patent trolls to pay the other party's attorneys fees. 

We also work with law school clinics to offer free legal defense to technology startups being threatened with baseless patent litigation.
