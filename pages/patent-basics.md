## Utility Patent


## Provisional Patents


## Design Patents

Design patents protect the "ornamental appearance" of a product. They can protect industrial design and physical products, as well as software user interface designs and fonts. 

Cost - To file a design patent, estimate $380 in USPTO fees and about $1,000 in legal fees. Then tack on another $280 fee when the patent issues (about a year after filing). For several related design patents, the legal fees per patent will decrease.

## The [MPEP](../MPEP/index.html) in Jekyll. 
The Manual of Patent Examination Procedure guides US patent examiners in approving and rejecting patent applications. Its a huge book, and a Jekyll-based website is a convenient way to read it. (I think Github's switch to Jekyll 2.2 broke my MPEP pages. They're just rendering as unstyled text. Sorry.)

Some important sections are [Obviousness](../MPEP/s2141.html), [written description](../MPEP/s2163.html), and [patentable subject matter](../MPEP/s2106.html).
