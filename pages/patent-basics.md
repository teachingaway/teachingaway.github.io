Patents come in 3 major flavors: utility, design, and provisional. If we just say "patent" we're probably talking about a utility patent - a patent on a new and useful technology. A _design patent_ is a similar animal, but protects the "ornamental appearance" of a new design. Finally, a "_provisional_" is shorthand for a "provisional patent application." Its not a patent at all, its just a type of temporary patent application that nails down a filing date at the Patent Office.

# Types of Patents

This section briefly covers Utility Patents, Provisional Patent Applications, Design Patents and Plant Patents. 

## Utility Patent

A US utility patent secures the right to prevent other people from making, selling or importing a *new and useful technology* in the United States for a period of 20 years after the application date. It is the right to prevent other people from selling the technology, but it does not guarantee that the patent holder herself has the rights to sell the technology.   

Patents are national rights. A US patent does not automatically grant rights in any other countries.

## Provisional Patent Applications

A provisional patent application is a temporary patent application that nails down a filing date at the Patent Office. If an inventor files a full utility patent application within 1 year after the provisional, the later full application will be treated as though it was filed on the date of the earlier provisional application. 

There are several benefits. Its often cheaper to file a provisional application than prepare a complete patent application. This allows an inventor to delay some legal costs for a year, and use this year to test the market for the new technology.

## Design Patents

Design patents protect the "ornamental appearance" of a product. They can protect industrial design and physical products, as well as software user interface designs and fonts.

## Plant Patents 

Plants can be patented. Plant patents protect newly discovered varieties of *asexually reproducing* plants. [MPEP 1600](/mpep/mpep-1600.html). Algae and macro fungi are considered plants, but not bacteria.  Tuber propagated plants cannot be patented. Plants found in nature (uncultivated) cannot be patented. 

A plant patent lasts for 20 years from the application date.

# Hiring a Patent Lawyer

* **Approaching a Patent Lawyer**. Good patent lawyers are busy, and do not have the bandwidth to work with every potential client. The best clients are experts in their field of invention, and have made substantial progress toward solving a real-world problem. The worst clients are dilettantes who have only just come up with an "idea."  To make your initial inquiry stand out, tell the patent lawyer about your field of invention and relevant expertise. Don't disclose the secret sauce, just give an overview. E.g., 

> I've got a masters from Stanford in Biotechnology and have been working in the field for 5 years. I've solved problem X using technology Y.

The patent lawyer will quickly know whether she is the right lawyer for your invention, and if not, whether she can refer you to an appropriate lawyer. 

* **Non-Disclosure Agreements**. Attorneys generally do not sign non-disclosure agreements with their clients. They aren't necessary. Attorney ethics obligations required us to keep important client information confidential anyway. Likewise, most [venture ](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/07/26/on-ndas-and-confidentiality/) [capitalists](http://www.feld.com/archives/2006/02/why-most-vcs-dont-sign-ndas.html) with not sign an NDA. This isn't because of their ethics obligations, it's just because they don't want to deal with the hassle. Lawyers and VC's aside, everyone else should be signing reasonable-scope NDAs. This is particularly important before a patent application is filed.


# Patent Application Process

* **Invention Disclosure**. The inventor fills out a detailed "invention disclosure form" describing the new technology. It's often helpful to describe the invention invention in terms of problem-and-solution. Describe the problem the invention solves, and then carefully describe the details of how the invention solves this problem. 

*  **Novelty Search**. The patent attorney may or may not conduct a "novelty search." A novelty search is a search of the USPTO patent database (and potentially other databases) for prior art. 

*  **Filing**. The patent attorney will draft and file your patent application. Once filed, you can label your technology as "patent pending."  

*  **Publication**. The patent application will be "published" 18 months after it's filed. If a provisional application was filed, the publication takes place 18 months after the provisional. Published patent application are available to the public on the USPTO's database. Publication can be delayed by filing a [non-publication request](/mpep/s1122.html/), but only if the inventor is sure that she does not want to seek patent protection in foreign countries.  

*  **Office Actions**. About 2 years after the application is filed, the a USPTO Patent Examiner will review the application. The Patent Examiner will generally issue an "Office Action" rejecting the application based on prior art. If the Patent Examiner finds a prior art document that describes the exact invention, she will reject the application under § 102 as [anticipated](../mpep/s2131.html/) by the prior art. MPEP 2131.  If the Patent Examiner can't find prior art describing the exact invention, but can find a handful of related prior art patents that, in combination, describe the invention, then she will reject the application as [obvious](../mpep/s2141.html/) under § 103. MPEP 2141. 

* **Patent Prosecution**. The patent attorney can reply to the Office Action by pointing out errors in the Patent Examiner's reasoning or by amending the patent application to claim parts of the invention not described by the prior art. In general, no new material can be added to a patent application after it's filed.  If new material is necessary, the Patent Attorney must file a "continuation in part" application. This resets the clock on prior art, expanding the prior art pool to include more recent documents. 

* **Allowance and Issue**. If the Patent Examiner cannot find any prior art, she will allow the claims. The inventor pays an "issue fee" and the patent application is on its way to becoming a full patent.

# Patent Lifespan 

**Utility Patent Lifespan** A US utility patent lasts for 20 years from the date of the earliest non-provisional patent application. 

**Patent Term Adjustment.** The 20 year patent lifespan starts from the *application date*. This means the longer the application is pending at the Patent Office, the shorter the actual patent lifespan. If the patent application process is delayed, applicants can ask the the Patent Office to extend the life of the issued patent. [MPEP 2700](/mpep/mpep-2700.html/).

**Maintenance Fees**. The US Patent Office requires three maintenance fees to be paid: at 3.5 years, 7.5 years, and 11.5 years after the patent's issue date. Failure to pay will result in early expiration. [MPEP 2500](/mpep/mpep-2500.html).

**Design Patent Lifespan**. A US design patent lasts for 15 years from the issue date. There are no maintenance fees to pay.

# Patent Ownership

In general, a patent is initially owned by its "inventor" or "joint inventors."  Companies funding research should be careful to have their employees and contracts sign "invention assignment agreements" to transfer the patent rights over to the company. This assignments should be [recorded at the USPTO](/mpep/s302.html) within 3 months of any patent application filing. [MPEP 302](/mpep/s302.html).

The default ownership rules for "joint inventors" can be messy. Fortunately, co-inventors can sidestep the messy default rules by assigning their ownership interests to a company (perhaps a company where they own an equal share of stock).

# Who are the "Inventors"?  

If a team of scientists and engineers work on a project, are they all inventors? Since the inventors are the initial owners of a patent, understanding the definition of an "inventor" is critical. “The threshold question in determining inventorship is who conceived the invention. Unless a person contributes to the *conception* of the invention, he is not an inventor." [MPEP 2137.01(II)](/mpep/s2137.html#d0e206713). 

An inventor can consider ideas and materials from many sources, such as a suggestion from colleagues or consultants, "so long as he maintains intellectual domination of the work of making the invention down to the successful testing, selecting or rejecting as he goes, even if such suggestion or material proves to be the key that unlocks his problem.” [MPEP 2137.01(III)](/mpep/s2137.html#d0e206713). 

Members of a team who merely follow directions from an inventor are not themselves inventors. They may only become inventors if they contribute to the 
conception of the invention, such as the physical structure or operative steps. Likewise, the inventor does not need to get her hands dirty in the lab to maintain her "inventor" status. She can merely conceive an idea, and then direct underlings to conduct experiments or build prototypes.  *In re DeBaun*, 687 F.2d 459, 463 (CCPA 1982)(“there is no requirement that the inventor be the one to reduce the invention to practice so long as the reduction to practice was done on his behalf”). [MPEP 2137.01(IV)](/mpep/s2137.html#d0e206713).

# Patentable Subject Matter

Patents are only issued to people who invent a "new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof..." 35 USC 101. [MPEP 2104](/mpep/s2104.html). 


- - - 

# Prior Art 

Prior art generally refers to a "printed publication" describing the technology that became public before the date of the patent application. Any public use or sale of the technology before the date of the patent application can also be prior art. 35 USC 102. [MPEP 706.02](/mpep/s706.html#d0e58220).

### New Use for an Existing Product

In general, a new use for an existing product is not patentable. In limited circumstances, a new use for an existing structure based on newly discovered  properties of the structure might be patentable as a process of use. [MPEP 2112](/mpep/s2112.html/#d0e201422). 

### New Use for an Existing Process

A new use for an existing process can be patented, but the prosecution may be difficult, and the resulting patent likely to provide only narrow protections. 
[MPEP 2112.02](/mpep/s2112.html/#d0e201360). 

### Using a Conventional Process to Make a Non-Obvious Product

There is no *per se* rule here. Sometimes a conventional process can be patented if it is limited to making or using a nonobvious product. The test for obviousness under 35 U.S.C. 103 requires a highly fact-dependent analysis involving taking the claimed subject matter as a whole and comparing it to the prior art. “A process yielding a novel and nonobvious product may nonetheless be obvious; conversely, a process yielding a well-known product may yet be nonobvious.” [MPEP 2116](/mpep/s2116.html#d0e201660) (citing, *TorPharm, Inc. v. Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, Inc.*, 336 F.3d 1322, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

# The [MPEP](../mpep/index.html) in Jekyll. 

The Manual of Patent Examination Procedure is the guide US patent examiners use to review patent applications. It's a huge book, and the USPTO's web interface is pretty bad, so we made this [MPEP website](../mpep/index.html).

Some important sections are [Obviousness](../mpep/s2141.html), [written description](../mpep/s2163.html), and [patentable subject matter](../mpep/s2106.html).
