Patents come in 3 major flavors: utility, design, and provisional. If we just say "patent" we're probably talking about a utility patent - a patent on a new and useful technology. A _design patent_ is a similar animal, but protects the "ornamental appearance" of a new design. Finally, a "_provisional_" is shorthand for a "provisional patent application." Its not a patent at all, its just a type of temporary patent application that nails down a filing date at the Patent Office.

## Utility Patent

A US utility patent secures the right to prevent other people from making, selling or importing a *new and useful technology* in the United States for a period of 20 years after the application date. It is the right to prevent other people from selling the technology, but it does not guarantee that the patent holder herself has the rights to sell the technology.   

Patents are national rights. A US patent does not automatically grant rights in any other countries.

## Provisional Patents

A provisional patent application is a temporary patent application that nails down a filing date at the Patent Office. If an inventor files a full utility patent application within 1 year after the provisional, the later full application will be treated as though it was filed on the date of the earlier provisional application. 

There are several benefits. Its often cheaper to file a provisional application than prepare a complete patent application. This allows an inventor to delay some legal costs for a year, and use this year to test the market for the new technology. 

## Design Patents

Design patents protect the "ornamental appearance" of a product. They can protect industrial design and physical products, as well as software user interface designs and fonts.

## Plant Patents 

Plants can also be patented. [MPEP 1600](/mpep/mpep-1600.html).

## Patent Application Process

* **Invention Disclosure**. The inventor fills out a detailed "invention disclosure form" describing the new technology. It's often helpful to describe the invention invention in terms of problem-and-solution. Describe the problem the invention solves, and then carefully describe the details of how the invention solves this problem. 

*  **Novelty Search**. The patent attorney may or may not conduct a "novelty search." A novelty search is a search of the USPTO patent database (and potentially other databases) for prior art. 

*  **Filing**. The patent attorney will draft and file your patent application. Once filed, you can label your technology as "patent pending."  

*  **Publication**. The patent application will be "published" 18 months after it's filed. If a provisional application was filed, the publication takes place 18 months after the provisional. Published patent application are available to the public on the USPTO's database. Publication can be delayed by filing a [non-publication request](/mpep/s1122/), but only if the inventor is sure that she does not want to seek patent protection in foreign countries.  

*  **Office Actions**. About 2 years after the application is filed, the a USPTO Patent Examiner will review the application. The Patent Examiner will generally issue an "Office Action" rejecting the application based on prior art. If the Patent Examiner finds a prior art document that describes the exact invention, she will reject the application under ยง 102 as [anticipated](../mpep/s2131/) by the prior art. MPEP 2131.  If the Patent Examiner can't find prior art describing the exact invention, but can find a handful of related prior art patents that, in combination, describe the invention, then she will reject the application as [obvious](../mpep/s2141/) under ยง 103. MPEP 2141. 

* **Patent Prosecution**. The patent attorney can reply to the Office Action by pointing out errors in the Patent Examiner's reasoning or by amending the patent application to claim parts of the invention not described by the prior art. In general, no new material can be added to a patent application after it's filed.  If new material is necessary, the Patent Attorney must file a "continuation in part" application. This resets the clock on prior art, expanding the prior art pool to include more recent documents. 

* **Allowance and Issue**. If the Patent Examiner cannot find any prior art, she will allow the claims. The inventor pays an "issue fee" and the patent application is on its way to becoming a full patent.

## Patent Lifespan 

**Utility Patent Lifespan** A US utility patent lasts for 20 years from the date of the earliest non-provisional patent application. 

**Patent Term Adjustment.** The 20 year patent lifespan starts from the *application date*. This means the longer the application is pending at the Patent Office, the shorter the actual patent lifespan. If the patent application process is delayed, applicants can ask the the Patent Office to extend the life of the issued patent. [MPEP 2700](/mpep/mpep-2700.html/).

**Maintenance Fees**. The US Patent Office requires three maintenance fees to be paid: at 3.5 years, 7.5 years, and 11.5 years after the patent's issue date. Failure to pay will result in early expiration. [MPEP 2500](/mpep/mpep-2500.html).

**Design Patent Lifespan**. A US design patent lasts for 15 years from the issue date. There are no maintenance fees to pay.

## The [MPEP](../mpep/index.html) in Jekyll. 
The Manual of Patent Examination Procedure is the guide US patent examiners use to review patent applications. It's a huge book, and the USPTO's web interface is pretty bad, so we made this [MPEP website](../mpep/index.html).

Some important sections are [Obviousness](../mpep/s2141.html), [written description](../mpep/s2163.html), and [patentable subject matter](../mpep/s2106.html).
