**[This is a Work in Progress]**

**Introduction**

The web is full of legal and business advice for startups. We’ve tried to sift the useful info from the sea of vapid listicles. Since we’re lawyers, our focus is startup law blogs. While some law blogs give incomplete or incorrect advice, the biggest problem is their tendency to preach overlawyering. That is, risk-averse lawyers want every startup to use the same expensive legal procedures used by established companies. This is low-risk advice for the lawyer to give, and low-value advice for the startup to receive.  

Our post here tries to highlight lawyers writing accurate and startup-appropriate information. We don’t guarantee it will be good advice for you, only that it will be worth reading. We’ve rounded out the law blogs with some VC and entrepreneur blogs. This series is broken up into several parts. 

1. Formation and Founders. We offer some resources for easier contracts and term sheet generation. Then we discuss when to incorporate, who to split equity among cofounders, and how to document cofounder deals. Should you form an Corporation or an LLC and in what state? 

2. Hiring Startup Lawyers. 

3. Raising Money. How to Pitch an Investor; How much to raise and at what Valuation? 

4. Angel Investors and Seed Financing. How to Find the Right Angel Investor/ Seed Fund. Incubators, Accelerators, etc. Convertible Debt. Standardized Docs for Seed Financing - Commentary and documents. 

5. Term Sheets. What is the ideal First Round Term Sheet? Negotiating the Term Sheet. Brad Feld’s Term Sheet Series (2005). 

6. Raising Venture Capital - the Series A round. 

# Formation and Founders

[How to Start a Startup](http://paulgraham.com/start.html) - Paul Graham, 2005. Start here. 

## Resources:

[Clerky](https://www.clerky.com/) |  A spin-off from the law firm Orrick, Clerky helps you generate the founders’ arrangements you need for a VC-backable DE corporation. Clerky will form your entity and keep track of your e-signed paperwork. You may need a lawyer to understand all the bells and whistles.
[Docracy](http://www.docracy.com/) |  Open source legal contracts. Eric and Zeke were early advisors to the project, and Eric ended up with his face on the landing page. 
[Shake](http://www.shakelaw.com/) | Create, send and sign legal docs. Shake’s lightweight app is perfect for small agreements. 

## When to Incorporate?

[Founders' Agreement Template](https://www.docracy.com/6348/founders-agreement-template#) | Zeke Vermillion, 2013 | A general guide for a pre-incorporation business agreement between cofounders. It allows people to collaborate on speculative, early-stage business projects on fair terms, without a lot of hassle or paperwork. Founders should replace this with a corporation and traditional startup structure when the following blog post applies. 
[When do I need to incorporate a company?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/07/20/when-do-i-need-to-incorporate-a-company/) | Yokum Taku, 2009 | Startups should spend some money on incorporation if they have more than one founder, start creating serious intellectual property, need to hire employees or contractors, issue stock options, get visas, or want to start the capital gains holding period. 

**Cofounder Agreements and Initial Equity Splits.** Should you split startup ownership 50/50 with your cofounder? Are you both putting in exactly 50% of the work and 50% of the seed capital? 

[Finance Fridays: Getting Started – Allocating Equity and Founder’s Investment](http://www.feld.com/archives/2011/07/finance-fridays-getting-started-allocating-equity-and-founders-investment.html) | Brad Feld, 2011 | Feld discusses the issue with a hypothetical: Jane and Dick each bring a similar level of skill to thestartup, but only Jane has the spare cash to invest in the startups initial expenses. How could they treat Jane’s cash investment in the business in a way that was fair to both cofounders?
[The only wrong answer is 50/50: Calculating the co-founder equity split](http://www.geekwire.com/2011/wrong-answer-5050-calculating-cofounder-equity-split/)  | Dan Shapiro, Geekwire, 2011  |  Shapiro offers a formula for dividing up initial cofounder equity. 
[Dividing equity between founders](http://cdixon.org/2009/08/23/dividing-equity-between-founders/) | Chris Dixon, 2009  |  
[Founder Vesting](http://cdixon.org/2009/04/21/founder-vesting/)  | Chris Dixon, 2009  | 
[The Perils of Founder Fighting](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/01/04/the-perils-of-founder-fighting/) | Mark Suster, 2014 | 

## **LLC or Corporation? S Corp or C Corp?**

* [What type of entity should I form?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/03/12/what-type-of-entity-should-i-form/) Yokum Taku, 2009. Form a Delaware corporation (probably). 

* S Corp or C Corp? 

## Incorporate in Delaware? in NY?

Delaware offers the strongest corporate laws and many investors will expect to see a Delaware corporation. The downside is that incorporating in Delaware will add some extra paperwork and a Delaware "franchise tax" of about $350/year for a pre-revenue startup. Overall, you should probably incorporate your business in Delaware. 

* [What state should I incorporate in?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/03/03/what-state-should-i-incorporate-in/) Yokum Taku, 2009. Incorporate in Delaware (probably). 

* [How do you calculate Delaware franchise taxes?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/02/01/how-do-you-calculate-delaware-franchise-taxes/) Yokum Taku, 2008. If you incorporate in Delaware, you need to pay an annual "franchise tax." Here’s how to calculate it. 

* [When do I "really" need to qualify my Delaware-formed startup?](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2013/10/04/texas-startups-qualifying-foreign-entity/) Jose Ancer, 2013. Delaware companies need to “qualify” in the states where they “conduct business.” For example, if your office is in New York, your startup needs to “qualify” in NY by filling out a form and paying a fee. Ancer’s comments are for Texas, but probably apply to New York companies as well, where the fee for an LLC to “qualify” can be over $1,000 (including the anachronistic “publication” requirement). 

## **Issuing Shares & 83(b) Election**. 

A newly incorporated company needs to issue shares, and the cofounders then need to buy these shares (If you think buying the shares of your brand new startup is bad, just wait until you have pay your VC’s legal bills).  If a founder isn’t paying cash for her shares in the company, she should pay with intellectual property. But this IP-for-shares deal need to be documented properly and needs to comply with section 351 of the tax code.

* [How many shares should be authorized in the certificate of incorporation?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/01/25/how-many-shares-should-be-authorized-in-the-certificate-of-incorporation/) Yokum Taku, 2008.  Issue 15 million shares of common stock, with 8 million to founders,  and 2 million to the employee option pool, for a fully-diluted base of 10 million shares. The 5 million remaining shares are an "authorized but unissued" reserve. These are rough numbers, and will get adjusted at each round of financing. 

* [The Founder’s Stock Issuance](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2012/06/11/the-founders-stock-issuance/). Jose Ancer, 2012.

* [Should founders pay for their stock in cash or contribute intellectual property?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/01/14/should-founders-pay-for-their-stock-in-cash-or-contribute-intellectual-property/) Yokum Taku, 2008. If you’re not buying shares with cash, you can buy them with IP, as long as you follow the rules. 

* [What should the vesting terms of founder stock be before a venture financing?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2007/07/19/what-should-the-vesting-terms-of-founder-stock-be-before-a-venture-financing/) Yokum Taku, 2007. Yes, subject your own shares to vesting, especially if you have cofounders. While your first real investors will probably want to adjust the vesting schedule, starting off with a reasonable vesting timeline can be useful.  Try four year vesting with a one year cliff. This means that 25% of a founder’s shares will vest on the one year anniversary, and then 1/48 of the total shares will vest every month after that. 

* [What is an 83(b) election?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/02/15/what-is-an-83b-election/) Yokum Taku, 2007. 

* [How do you set the exercise price of stock options to avoid Section 409A issues?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/01/01/how-do-you-set-the-exercise-price-of-stock-options-to-avoid-section-409a-issues/) Yokum Taku, 2009.

# Hiring Startup Lawyers

**You need a startup lawyer, but not your investor’s startup lawyer. **

* [Lawyers or Insurance Salesmen?](http://startupboy.com/2005/11/30/lawyers-or-insurance-salesmen/) Naval Ravikant, 2005. "Don’t just go with the lawyer that the VCs insist upon. These lawyers will work with the VC on a hundred financings and with you on only one. Where do you think their loyalties lie?"

* [Don’t Use Your Lead Investor’s Lawyers](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2014/01/05/lead-investor-startup-lawyer-dont/). Jose Ancer, 2014. 

**Finding the Right Lawyer.** 

* [Why experienced entrepreneurs hire better lawyers](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2012/11/22/why-experienced-entrepreneurs-hire-better-lawyers/). Jose Ancer, 2013. 

* [The Startup Lawyer Tech Audit](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2012/05/16/the-startup-lawyer-tech-audit/). Jose Ancer, 2012. Would Adler Vermillion pass the lawyer tech audit? We’re serving this webpage from Github right now. 

* [It’s the Hours, not the Rate – Why Most People Focus on the Wrong Thing When Choosing a Lawyer](http://www.jasonmendelson.com/wp/archives/2013/01/its-the-hours-not-the-rate-why-most-people-focus-on-the-wrong-thing-when-choosing-a-lawyer.php). Jason Mendelson, 2013. "In all my years of auditing lawyer bills, it’s the hours that always stand out.  The hours, in any complex matter are what spiral out of control.  In these big issue situations (litigation, patent stuff, M&A, IPOs, etc.), the amount of hours that an efficient and creative lawyer will save you far, far outweigh whatever hourly rate they may charge. 

* [Form Your Austin Startup Yourself Before Hiring a Cheap Lawyer](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2013/05/01/austin-startup-form-yourself-avoid-crappy-lawyers/). Jose Ancer, 2013.

**What do lawyers even do for you?** 

* [Lawyers are referees, not coaches](http://venturehacks.com/articles/referees). Venture Hacks, 2008. Lawyers teach you the rules of the game, but not how to win it. Your lawyer will tell you whether something is legal and whether it would breach a contract. A good lawyer can tell you about problems that tend to arise in similar deals. However, lawyers generally can’t tell you whether something will create value. 

* [Contracts are for the Divorce; Not the Honeymoon](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2014/07/16/startup-contracts-divorce-marriage/). Jose Ancer, 2014. Some lawyers make mountains out of mole-hills. Others save startups real money by avoiding common traps for first-time founders. Know when to listen to your lawyer and when to listen to your investor. 

**Lawyer Fees, and getting the Best Value from your Lawyer. **

* [Should I give my lawyers equity?](http://venturehacks.com/articles/lawyer-equity) Venture Hacks, 2007.  An equity grant to a biglaw shop isn’t a great incentive to the individual lawyers working on your startup because the equity will probably be spread around the entire firm. Here are some other options. 

* [Should I pay my investor's legal fees?](http://venturehacks.com/articles/investors-legal-fee) Venture Hacks, 2007. You will probably need to pay it. Try to get the legal fees capped (for both your lawyer and the VC’s lawyer) before negotiations get started. Don’t give up a big chunk of equity "for the privilege of paying your investor’s legal bill." 

* [What Are Standard Legal Fee Arrangements For Un-Funded Startups?](http://www.askthevc.com/wp/archives/2007/06/what-are-standard-legal-fee-arrangments-for-un-funded-startups.html) Jason Mendelson, 2007. $5k fixed fee for incorporation, founder issuance, all initial contracts. Also discusses common terms for deferring legal fees. 

* [What should legal fees in a Series A financing be?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2007/12/08/what-should-legal-fees-in-a-series-a-financing-be/) Yokum Taku, 2007. "Legal fees in Series A venture financings routinely exceed $50K." Remember that your startup will need to pay both its own lawyer and the VC’s lawyer. 

* [Why Start-up Lawyers Frustrate Me](http://www.jasonmendelson.com/wp/archives/2008/06/why-start-up-lawyers-frustrate-me.php). Jason Mendelson, 2008. The best startup lawyers know when to leave well enough alone. They don’t waste time marking up documents don’t have any major problems. 

* [The Cost of Customization](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2012/07/17/the-cost-of-complexity/). Jose Ancer, 2012. "One way to tell whether you’ve found yourself a decent tech lawyer is to count how often he/she tells you to keep things simple."

**How much Law should founders Learn? **

* [Entrepreneurs need to learn some law](http://cdixon.org/2009/09/13/entrepreneurs-need-to-learn-some-law/). Chris Dixon, 2009. "you can’t outsource the understanding of key financing and other legal documents to lawyers."

* [Reading your legal docs](http://venturehacks.com/articles/legal-docs). Venture Hacks, 2011. "Read and understand everything in the term sheet. But when it comes to the closing docs, ask your lawyer to explain...."

* [You Should Read Every Word of Every Legal Doc](http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/06/you-should-read-every-word-of-every.html). Elad Gil, 2011. I’m not sure I agree. "every word" is an awful lot of reading, and a huge distraction from building a business and a product. 

**Anti-Lawyer Rants**

* [https://twitter.com/bramcohen/status/7336163022](https://twitter.com/bramcohen/status/7336163022)

* [VCs & Tech Lawyers: INNOVATE, AUTOMATE, SIMPLIFY](http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2007/09/vcs-tech-lawyer.html). Dave McClure (2007). A wonderful rant. 

* [Top 10 reasons why Entrepreneurs hate lawyers](http://venturehacks.com/articles/hate-lawyers). Scott Walker, 2010. Jargon, unresponsive, overlawyering & failure to prioritize, inexperienced associates doing all the work, and lawyers love to point out problems without offering solutions.  

* [Legal Fees: Start Swearing Now](https://web.archive.org/web/20130728083853/http://www.burningdoor.com/askthewizard/2007/04/legal_fees_start_swearing_now.html). Dick Costolo, 2007. Costolo is now Twitter’s CEO. The ghost of his old blog lives on at archive.org. It advises startups to find a law firm with experience in "financings, corporate creation, contracts - especially contracts, patent/IP work, M&A work, options plans." Since your startup will be paying fees for both sets of lawyers (your lawyer and the VC’s lawyer), try to get both firms to cap their fees at the start. Also, try Dick’s “patent-pending-financing-legal-fees-negotiation-tactic. Here's how it works. Before the two sides start negotiating, I call both sides and start swearing about how upset I'm going to be if this costs more than some reasonable amount. I'm generally informed that it's going to cost a lot more than that reasonable amount, upon which I call and email both sides again and the investors and swear a lot more about how capital inefficient this is and what a waste it is, and since I actually feel this way and am by now swearing in the office about the cost, it has the added effect of not sounding disingenuous.” 

# Board Members & Advisors

* [Expectations for Outside Board Members](http://www.feld.com/archives/2014/04/expectations-outside-board-members.html). Brad Feld, 2014. 

* [Why You Shouldn’t Decide Anything Important at Your Board Meeting](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/03/19/why-you-shouldnt-decide-anything-important-at-your-board-meeting/). Mark Suster, 2014.

* [How Boards Need to Evolve Over Time](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/01/06/how-boards-need-to-evolve-over-time/). Mark Suster, 2014.

# Raising Money

* [How to Fund a Startup](http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html). Paul Graham, 2005. 

* [Fundraising Mistakes Founders Make](http://blog.samaltman.com/fundraising-mistakes-founder-make). Sam Altman, 2014.

* [Fundraising Survival Guide](http://www.paulgraham.com/fundraising.html). Paul Graham, 2008. 

* [The Equity Equation](http://paulgraham.com/equity.html). Paul Graham, 2007.

* [How to Present to Investors](http://paulgraham.com/investors.html). Paul Graham, 2010. 

* [Hackers Guide to Investors](http://paulgraham.com/guidetoinvestors.html). Paul Graham, 2007. 

* [Why Most VCs Won’t Intro You To Other VCs (Unless You Follow These Steps)](http://hunterwalk.com/2014/08/11/why-most-vcs-wont-intro-you-to-other-vcs-unless-you-follow-these-steps/). Hunter Walk, 2014. 

## How Many Investors? 

* [Party rounds](http://blog.samaltman.com/party-rounds). Sam Altman, 2013. 

* [How Many Investors are Too Many?](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/02/22/how-many-investors-are-too-many/) Mark Suster, 2011. 

## NDAs and Ideas vs. Execution 

Don’t ask a serious VC Investor to sign your NDA before you pitch. Instead, pitch your idea only to investors with a reputation for honest dealing. In any event, the value of a startup isn’t in the idea, its in the execution of the idea. 

* [Why you shouldn’t keep your startup idea secret](http://cdixon.org/2009/08/22/why-you-shouldnt-keep-your-startup-idea-secret/). Chris Dixon, 2009. Talk about your idea to almost anyone who will listen: investors, entrepreneurs, friends, people on the street, the bartender, etc.

* [The myth of the Eureka moment](http://cdixon.org/2009/05/15/the-myth-of-the-eureka-moment/). Chris Dixon, 2009. "In the 10 years I’ve been involved with startups, I have never seen a “Eureka" moment where someone suddenly comes up with a great idea.  Instead, I have always found idea development to be a wrenching and often meandering process that is guided mostly by instinct.”

* [What is important in a confidentiality agreement or non-disclosure agreement (NDA)?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/04/27/what-is-important-in-a-confidentiality-agreement-or-non-disclosure-agreement-nda/) Yokum Taku, 2008. When you do need an NDA, here are the important terms to think about. 

## How much to raise and at what Valuation?

* [What’s the right amount of seed money to raise?](http://cdixon.org/2009/12/28/whats-the-right-amount-of-seed-money-to-raise/) Chris Dixon, 2009. Raise "enough to get your startup to an accretive milestone plus some fudge factor. ‘Accretive milestone’ is a fancy way of saying getting your company to a point at which you can raise money at a higher valuation."

* [Why Startups Should Raise Money at the Top End of Normal](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/06/05/why-startups-should-raise-money-at-the-top-end-of-normal/). Mark Suster, 2011. Reach for a strong valuation, but reach too far and you might can get burned by the dreaded down round. "Most investors won’t want to go through the brain damage of doing a ‘down round,’ which creates tension between them and early investors.

# Angel Investors / Seed Financing

* [Notes on raising seed financing](http://cdixon.org/2011/06/09/notes-on-raising-seed-financing/). Chris Dixon, 2009. A great place to start. 

* [Bridges or Seeds? A Primer on Your First Financing](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2012/06/07/bridge-seed-financing-primer/). Jose Ancer, 2012. 

* [Upside risk](http://blog.samaltman.com/upside-risk). Sam Altman, 2013. Angels make their money from investing in rare companies that deliver 100x returns. The the real risk for angel investors is missing out on that outstanding investment, not failing to get their money back on their non-unicorn companies. "And yet angel investors continue to ask for onerous terms to mitigate their ‘downside risk.’  All this does is piss founders off, misalign incentives, and harm the investors’ chance of getting to invest in the best deals." 

## How to Find the Right Angel Investor/ Seed Fund

* [How to select your angel investors](http://cdixon.org/2009/11/03/how-to-select-your-angel-investors/). Chris Dixon, 2009. 

* [What is an accredited investor?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/04/03/what-is-an-accredited-investor/) Yokum Taku, 2009. If you can’t raise money from an established seed fund, then raise money from an experienced and  "accredited" angel investor. And if not experienced, at the very least “accredited.” (Accredited = sufficiently rich as defined in the securities laws). 

## Incubators, Accelerators, etc. 

* [The most important question to ask before taking seed money](http://cdixon.org/2009/10/30/the-most-important-question-to-ask-before-taking-seed-money/) (from a VC incubator). Chris Dixon, 2009. If your startup goes through a VC’s incubator, and the VC fund doesn’t invest at the end, it sends a strong negative signal to other VCs. So its important to ask, "How many companies that the sponsor passed on went on to raise money from other sources?"

* [The problem with taking seed money from big VCs](http://cdixon.org/2009/08/14/the-problem-with-taking-seed-money-from-big-vcs/). Chris Dixon, 2009. Another post on signaling risk.

* [Thoughts on Convertible Notes.](http://www.k9ventures.com/blog/2011/03/22/thoughts-on-convertible-notes/) Manu Kumar (2011). Convertible debt is appropriate for bridge financing (when a priced equity round is imminent, but convertible debt will misalign incentives in seed financing.

"VCs only need three rights: Up, Down, and Know What The Fuck Is Going On." Up = Pro-rata rights. VCs want to invest in next round to maintain their ownership in growing companies. Down = Liquidation preference. VCs want to get their money out first when the company isn’t growing. Know What The Fuck Is Going On = Board seat.

* [Conditions Precedent to Financing](http://feld.com/archives/2005/04/term-sheet-conditions-precedent-to-financing.html) - Startup doesn’t actually get money until after the VC gets its due diligence information. Terms are often standard, but there are some to watch out for.
