<p class="big-text">
The Trademark Office frequently rejects trademark applications for _Likelihood of Confusion_ with an existing registration, and for _lack of distinctiveness_. Both of these concepts involve the relationship between a "mark" and the product or service being advertised under the mark.</p>

# Merely Descriptive

If the trademark closely describes the product or services, it may receive a rejection under "Section 2(e)(1)" for being "Merely Descriptive." The Office Action will say something like this: 

 > Registration is refused because the applied-for mark merely describes a characteristic or feature of applicant’s goods. Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); see [TMEP §§1209.01(b)](/tmep/tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e6980). 
 > A mark is merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of an applicant’s goods. TMEP §1209.01(b); see, e.g., *DuoProSS Meditech Corp. v. Inviro Med. Devices, Ltd.*, 695 F.3d 1247, 1251, 103 USPQ2d 1753, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2012).

## Responding to a Merely Descriptive Rejection 

There three main options for responding to a "merely descriptive" rejection: (1) move the mark to the "supplemental register", (2) argue that the mark is not "descriptive", or (3) argue that the mark has "acquired distinctiveness" through use in commerce.

### Supplemental Register

First, you can move the mark to the "supplemental register" for 5 years. On the "supplemental register", the trademark will have very limited power,  After 5 years on the supplemental register, you can move the registration to the "primary register", where it will receive the full panoply of trademark protection.  The legal theory is that after 5 years of use, even a "descriptive" trademark will become so closely associated with your product that it will be worthy of a trademark registration. 

**Rights on the Supplemental Register.** A trademark registered on the "Supplemental Register" can still use the ® symbol. A supplemental register registration will get you in the door to a federal court, but it may be difficult to win the federal trademark lawsuit.  It can also be used as a springboard to register the trademark in foreign countries (particularly useful in Latin America). 

Perhaps the most important benefit is that your trademark will show up in trademark searches, and Trademark Examiners may find it and use it to reject third party trademark applications for marks that are similar to yours. 

An "Intent to Use" trademark application is ineligible for the Supplemental Register.

### Argue Inherent Distinctiveness

You can also argue to the examiner that the mark is not actually "descriptive" of the product. The difference between a descriptive mark and a distinctive mark is described at [TMEP 1209.01](/tmep/tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e6993). There are several factors to consider in determining whether a mark is descriptive [TMEP 1209.03](/tmep/tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e7558), and the TM Examiner does not always come to the right conclusion. Sending a polite and carefully researched reply has persuade a Trademark Examining Attorney to change her mind and allow the trademark application. 

### Argue Acquired Distinctiveness

Even if a mark is not "inherently distinctive", it can still "acquire distinctiveness" through use in commerce. [TMEP 1212](/tmep/tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e10316). 

**Five Years of Use.** The easiest route to "acquired distinctiveness" is by submitting evidence of 5 years of continuous use in commerce. After 5 years of use, the TM Office will **presume** that your customers have come to recognize your mark as being closely associated with your products and services, and that it is worthy of a trademark registration. 

**Actual Evidence.** It is also possible to establish distinctiveness by submitting "actual evidence." [TMEP 1212.06](/tmep/tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e11238/). This is a more difficult road to follow, but evidence of substantial advertising expenditures and wide brand recognition will be helpful. Gathering evidence of acquired distinctiveness tends to be an expensive option.
