Trademark protect brand identity. They reduce the risk of [namespace collision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_collision). A trademark can be any name, image or slogan used to identify a company. 

## Trademarks:  <em>Brand Protection</em>

Our attorneys understand modern identity development, trademark registration and enforcement. We understand the fluid nature of branding for the internet, and we guide clients toward unique and defensible brand identities.

## Costs for US Trademark Application

We generally bill a $2,000 flat fee for trademark registrations. This includes a preliminary "knockout" search of the US Trademark Office database, preparation and filing of the US Trademark application, and the application fee for the first "class" of goods. 

This flat fee also includes replies to quick Office Actions (i.e., problems that can be solved with a 5 minute phone call to the Trademark Office). However, responding to longer Office Actions is billed hourly. 

Most of our trademark applications are approved and registered without any additional fees. 

## Costs for International Trademark Applications

**Application Process.** The "Madrid Protocol" provides a fairly efficient mechanism for international trademark registrations. There are three main steps. First, we file a single international trademark application in the US Trademark Office. This application includes a list of foreign countries where we are looking for trademark protection, as well as a fee for each country. Second, The US Trademark Office forwards the application to the International Bureau (“IB”) of the World Intellectual Property Organization for review.  Third, if approved, the IB forwards the application to the trademark offices of every country listed in the original application. The process takes about 18 months from application to registration. 

**Cost.** The cost varies, but generally comes to around $2,000 in legal fees, plus filings fees (which vary by country). For example, the fee for filing in the EU, China, Japan and Mexico is about $3,000 (making the total fee around $5,000). 

**Local Counsel.** If an international application is rejected by a foreign trademark office, the response needs to be filed by a local trademark lawyer from that foreign country. This can add significant cost. 

**Trademark Office Fees.** There are fees at each stage. The International Bureau charges a $650 fee; and each country’s trademark office charges a fee of around $300. 


| Country | Cost |  |
|:--------|:-------|:--------|
| International App   | 650   | For three classes |
| EU   | 1,100   | For three classes |
| China | 250   | For one class|
| Korea | 225   |    |
| Japan | 600   |    |
| Mexico | 225   |    |
| Australia |  407  |    |
| Canada |  N/A  |    |
| Brazil |  N/A  |    |

International fees are paid in Swiss Francs, but exchange rate to USD is about 1:1. 

### Portfolio Management and Brand Monitoring

We help corporate clients manage their trademark portfolios and renewal deadlines. In addition, we offer infringement monitoring services where we track third party use of similar trademarks. We bill a reasonable quarterly fee based on the size and complexity of the trademark portfolio. 


## Domain Name Disputes

We have extensive experience litigating domain name arbitration matters. These arbitrations, called "UDRP" disputes, are often a cost-effective method of removing domain name squatters from your rightful internet domain. 

## Trademark Opposition and Cancellation Proceedings

We have extensive experience litigating opposition and cancellation proceedings at the US Patent and Trademark Office. These proceedings are like a type of "mini trial" at the Trademark Office, where the only issue to be decided is whether a pending trademark application should be allowed ("opposition proceeding") or whether an existing trademark registration should be cancelled ("cancellation proceeding"). 

## Trademark Registration Appeals at the USPTO

We have won several trademark registration appeals, even where the original attorney could not secure a trademark registration. 

## Trademark Non-Infringement Opinions

A trademark non-infringement opinion carefully analyzes your trademark to an existing trademark registration or common law trademark. If the analysis determines your mark is not infringing, it offers some piece of mind against future lawsuits, and demonstrates that you are operating in good faith. Even if a court eventually determines that your brand is infringing a trademark, the existence of the legal analysis and opinion can reduce the penalties. “A party who acts in reasonable reliance on the advice of counsel regarding a close question of trademark law generally does not act in bad faith.” [*Sands, Taylor & Wood Co. v. Quaker Oats Co.*, 978 F.2d 947 (7th Cir. 1992)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15288369877381273970).
