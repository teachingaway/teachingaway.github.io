## Patents:  <em>Defending Research & Development</em>

Our patent practice combines rigorous data analytics with deep patent law experience. As a result, we develop cost-efficient patent portfolio's for growing technology companies. We discuss [basic patent law here](/patent-basics/), and describe our [patent services here](/patent-services/).

A carefully structured portfolio can generate licensing deals, venture capital, and discourage others from aiming a patent lawsuit at your company. Patents can also be abused. However, on balance, patents tend to make business sense. Paul Graham of Y-Combinator argues that technology companies should secure patents for [several reasons](http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html), 

> We do advise the companies we fund to apply for patents, but not so they can sue competitors. Successful startups either get bought or grow into big companies. If a startup wants to grow into a big company, they should apply for patents to build up the patent portfolio theyâ€™ll need to maintain an armed truce with other big companies. If they want to get bought, they should apply for patents because patents are part of the mating dance with acquirers.

Graham also argues that patents help explain disruptive technology in terms that incumbents understand, and gives them a good excuse to buy a startup rather than copy its technology: 

> There's a third reason big companies should prefer buying to building: that if they built their own, they'd screw it up. But few big companies are smart enough yet to admit this to themselves. It's usually the acquirer's engineers who are asked how hard it would be for the company to build their own, and they overestimate their abilities. A patent seems to change the balance. It gives the acquirer an excuse to admit they couldn't copy what you're doing. It may also help them to grasp what's special about your technology.

## Trademarks:  <em>Brand Protection</em>

From identity development, to trademark registration and enforcement, we work side-by-side with clients to maximize brand value. We understand the fluid nature of branding for the internet, and we help direct direct clients toward unique and easily defensible identities. 

We discuss [basic trademark law here](/trademark-basics/), and describe our [trademark services here](/trademark-services/).


## Copyright:  <em>Defending Creative Works</em>

Copyright law helps creative professionals and software developers protect their art and code. We write <a href="http://www.copyrightcodex.com/">Copyright Codex</a>, a free treatise on copyright law that has been recognized by law schools like Stanford and Duke. 

## Trade Secrets

We help clients establish trade secret strategies to protect confidential information that may not fit neatly into the patent or copyright regimes. 

## IP Litigation

We litigate complex contract and intellectual property disputes. We defend technology companies from patent trolls. We also help enforce legitimate IP rights, even against larger, better-funded competitors. We contain litigation costs through efficient staffing and modern discovery technology. 

We have successfully handled disputes including patents, trade secrets, and contract and copyright disputes in federal court. 

### Patent and Trademark Office Litigation 

We have won trademark appeals at the Trademark Trial and Appeal board, and have deep experience in both "ex parte" (arguing against a trademark examiner's rejection) and "inter partes" (arguing against another trademark owner) disputes. 

We can also help dispose of invalid patents at Patent Trial and Appeal Board hearings. This includes "Post-Grant Review", "Covered Business Method Patent Review" and "Inter Partes Review." 

### Trade Secret and Non-Compete Litigation 

We have experience litigating trade secret and non-compete cases in the Manhattan Commercial Division of New York State court. This includes fast-paced "Temporary Restraining Order" hearings and "Preliminary Injunction Hearings." 

### Domain Name Disputes

We have won several domain name disputes (called "UDRP" arbitrations) against URL squatters. 

We also assist with negotiating, buying and transferring domain names.
