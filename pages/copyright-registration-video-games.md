# 700 Literary Works

## 714 Games

A game may be registered as a literary work if the predominant form of authorship in the work consists of text. Examples of works that may satisfy this requirement include word games, card games, party games, riddles, brain teasers, and similar diversions, including the instructions or directions for playing a particular game. A game may be registered as a work of the visual arts if the predominant form of authorship consists of pictorial or sculptural authorship. Examples of works that may satisfy this requirement include board games, playing cards, playing pieces, and the like. See 37 C.F.R. §§ 202.3(b)(1)(i), (iii).

When submitting an application to register a game, the claim should be limited to the text, artwork, and/or photographs that appear in the work (as applicable), the applicant should provide the name of the author who created that material, and the applicant should provide the name of the claimant who owns the copyright in that material. The Literary Division may accept a claim in “text” if the game contains a sufficient amount of written expression, or a claim in “artwork” and/or “photograph(s)” if the work contains a sufficient amount of pictorial or graphic expression. When completing an online application, this information should be provided in the Author Created field, and if applicable, also in the New Material Included field. When completing a paper application on Form TX, this information should be provided in space 2, and if applicable, also in space 6(b). For guidance on completing these portions of the application, see Chapter 600, Sections 618.4 and 621.8.

A registration for a game covers all of the copyrightable elements that appear in the work, regardless of whether the game has been registered as a literary work or a work of the visual arts. However, copyright does not protect the idea for a game, the name or title of a game, or the procedure, process, or method of operation for playing a game. Nor does copyright protect any idea, system, method, or device involved in developing or marketing a game. Once a game has been made available to the public, the copyright law cannot be used to prevent others from developing another game based on similar principles. Copyright protects only the particular expression that appears in the literary or artistic elements that the work may contain. See 17 U.S.C. § 102(b); 37 C.F.R. § 202.1.

If the game combines a number of physically separate elements, and if the claimant owns the copyright in all of those elements, it may be possible to register all of the parts together as a unit of publication. For information concerning this procedure, see Chapter 1100, Section 1107.

For a discussion of the practices and procedures for registering videogames, see Chapter 800, Section 807.7(A). For a discussion of the practices and procedures for registering board games, see Chapter 900, Section 910.

## 807.7 Registration Issues

This Section discusses frequent registration issues involving certain types of audiovisual works.

## 807.7(A) Videogames

### 807.7(A)(1) Videogames Distinguished from Computer Programs

Generally, a videogame contains two major components: the audiovisual material and the computer program. The audiovisual material of a videogame may be registered apart from the computer program that runs the game. When the audiovisual material and the computer program are both owned by the same entity, they may be registered together on one application.

An application to register a videogame should clearly state whether the claim extends to the computer program, the audiovisual material, or both components. If the authorship is described simply as “videogame,” the registration specialist may communicate with the applicant if the scope of the claim is unclear from the deposit material. For example, if the deposit material does not include source code for the computer program, the claim will extend only to the audiovisual material.

### 807.7(A)(2) One Videogame, Multiple Platforms

Videogames are commonly released on several different platforms. Applicants often attempt to register each platform separately. Generally, when the same work is published in different versions, the Office will issue separate registrations for each version only if they contain separable copyrightable material. See Chapter 500, Section 512.

If there are copyrightable differences in the audiovisual material (or the computer program) for each platform, the Office may issue a separate registration for each version. In this situation, the deposit material for each version should show some of the differences. In addition, the applicant should confirm, either in the Note to Copyright Office field or in a cover letter, that the audiovisual material (or computer program) differs between versions. If the applicant does not provide such a statement, the registration specialist will communicate with the applicant to determine whether the versions contain copyrightable differences.

If the differences do not appear in the audiovisual content, but instead appear solely in the computer programming that is used to achieve compatibility with the hardware and/or software for a particular device, console, platform, or operating system, the applicant should register only one version of the audiovisual work. This version will cover the copyrightable content in the other versions. For guidance in registering multiple versions of a computer program that generates a videogame, see Chapter 700, Section 721.8.

NOTE: If the audiovisual material is the same for each platform and the versions are published on separate dates, the applicant must register the version which was published first.

### 807.7(B) Karaoke Displays

Karaoke displays may be registered as audiovisual works if they contain a series of images other than scrolling preexisting lyrics. A display containing only scrolling preexisting song lyrics is not copyrightable. See Section 807.2(D).

Example:

- A karaoke display combining original scenic views of Los Angeles, scrolling lyrics to the Jerry Newfeld song “I Love Cake,” and the melody of that song constitutes a copyrightable audiovisual work (provided that the use of the song and the images is lawful).

### 807.7(C) Apps for Computers, Tablets, or Mobile Phones

Apps may constitute audiovisual works. Many apps contain a significant amount of preexisting artwork, such as icons. In such cases the preexisting material should be identified and excluded from the application, and the claim should be limited to the new copyrightable authorship. If the preexisting material has not been identified on the application, the registration specialist may communicate with the applicant to request that the claim be limited to the new copyrightable authorship.

The new copyrightable authorship should be described as “audiovisual material,” rather than “app” or “computer app.” See Section 807.8(B).

### 807.7(D) Banner Advertisements

Some banner advertisements are comprised of images and words that flash or scroll (using Java- or flash-based script) across a small window. Banner advertisements also may be comprised simply of images, text, and a link. The Office will consider the work as a whole to determine whether it contains sufficient copyrightable expression.

When registering a banner advertisement with an online application the applicant should state “audiovisual material” in the Author Created/Other field, and if applicable, in the New Material Included/Other field.

As a general rule, applicants should not select the box marked “entire motion picture.” If the advertisement contains a copyrightable series of images, but does not impart an impression of motion, or if the work lacks sufficient authorship as a “motion picture,” the registration specialist will communicate with the applicant and request that the authorship be described as “audiovisual material” rather than “entire motion picture.”

Examples:

- Michael Williams submits an application to register his claim in a banner advertisement that he created for a local activist organization. The authorship is described as “audiovisual material.” The deposit consists of short, textual phrases that alternate and zoom in and out with a mouse click. Michael’s original song plays in the background. The claim to copyright in this work will be accepted because the work, as a whole, contains a sufficient amount of copyrightable authorship.

- Mika Roberts submits an application to register her claim in a banner advertisement that she created for a local religious organization. The ad consists of a line of scrolling continuous text that is a long quote from the Bible. In the background, a public domain religious hymn plays. The registration specialist will refuse to register this claim. Although there is a series of images, the work contains an insufficient amount of original material support to base a copyright claim.

### 807.7(E) Slide Presentations

A slide presentation is a series of stills on a computer screen, videodisc, or videotape intended to be viewed as a single cohesive work, such as a PowerPoint presentation. If the work contains preexisting visual or aural material, that material should be identified and excluded from the claim, and the claim should be limited to the new copyrightable authorship.

# 900 Visual Art Works 


## 910 Games

Games often include both copyrightable and uncopyrightable elements. The copyightable elements of a game may include text, artwork, sound recordings, and/or audiovisual material. These elements may be protectable if they contain a sufficient amount of original authorship. Uncopyrightable elements include the underlying ideas for a game and the methods for playing and scoring a game. These elements cannot be registered, regardless of how unique, clever, or fun they may be.

When completing an application for this type of work, applicants should describe the specific elements of the game that the applicant intends to register, such as the text, the artwork on a playing board, and/or the original sculptural elements of game pieces. Applicants should not assert a claim in “game” or “game design,” because it is generally understood that the game as a whole encompasses the ideas underlying the game. For the same reason, applicants should not assert a claim in the methods for playing the game.

Examples:

- Gloria Glam files an application to register a new board game. In her application she asserts a claim in “text and board artwork.” The game board contains intricate designs and the instructions consist of two pages of text. The registration specialist will register the claim.

- Garfield Grant files an application for a new type of soccer playing field. The deposit material contains text and a set of technical drawings. The registration specialist will refuse to register the playing field itself, but will register the drawings and text that describe the field. The registration will extend only to the actual descriptive text and drawings and not to the design for the field itself.

- Glenn Garner files an application to register a “new game of chess, consisting of a new way to play the game, new playing pieces, and a new board with three levels.” The registration specialist may register any descriptive text and the design of the playing pieces if they contain a sufficient amount of creative expression. However, the specialist will refuse to register the idea for and method of playing the new game, as well as the idea of playing the game on a board split into three levels.

For information on how to register purely literary aspects of a game, see Chapter 700, Section 714. For information concerning the deposit requirements for games, see Chapter 1500, Sections 1509.1(B) and 1509.3(A)(7).

## 911 Characters

The original, visual aspects of a character may be protected by copyright if they are sufficiently original. This may include the physical attributes of the character, such as facial features and specific body shape, as well as images of clothing and any other visual elements.

The U.S. Copyright Office will register visual art works that depict a character, such as drawings, sculptures, and paintings. A registration for such works extends to the particular authorship depicted in the deposit material, but does not extend to unfixed characteristics of the character.

When completing an application to register such works, the applicant should use an appropriate term to describe the authorship embodied in the deposit material, such as “2-D artwork,” “photograph,” or “text.” Applicants should not refer to or assert claims in “character,” “character concept, idea, or style,” or a character’s generalized personality, conduct, temperament, or costume. If the applicant uses these terms, the registration specialist may ask the applicant to remove them from the claim. Likewise, if the deposit material contains a well-known or recognizable character, the specialist may ask the applicant to exclude that preexisting material from the claim if the applicant fails to complete the Limitation of Claim portion of the application.

Examples:

- Charles Crest creates a sketch of a field mouse with a straw hat and a mischievous grin. He intends to use the sketch in an animated film. He files an application that asserts a claim in “two-dimensional artwork” and “character.” The registration specialist may ask Charles to limit the claim to the artwork and to remove the term “character” from the application.

- Chris Crow creates a series of drawings featuring a stylized flamingo in several poses and wearing different hats. He files an application to register his drawings under the title “Concept Drawings for Character Designs” and he asserts a claim in “two-dimensional artwork.” The registration specialist may register the claim and may send the applicant a warning letter noting that the registration covers only the specific sketches included in the deposit.

- Chloe Crown creates a series of drawings depicting several well- known comic book characters. She files an application that asserts a claim in “character redesigns” or “new versions of characters.” The registration specialist may ask Chloe if she has permission to prepare these derivative works and to clarify the derivative authorship that she contributed to the preexisting material.




## 912 Comic Books

Comic books generally contain copyrightable pictorial, graphic, and literary content. These types of works often have multiple creators, and the issues surrounding the authorship and ownership of the various contributions can be complex.

In some cases, the creators may prepare their contributions on a work for hire basis as employees or pursuant to a freelancer work made for hire agreement. In some cases, the comic book may be a joint work. In other cases, different authors may create different aspects of the comic book, with some aspects originating from the publisher and other aspects originating from one or more individual, nonemployee authors (i.e., derivative works). For example, the publisher may claim ownership of the characters and the basic story, and may hire others to create the artwork, text, and/or lettering for particular issues. Then a freelance or staff contributor may contribute coloring and editing. If all of the work is done on a work made for hire basis, the authorship is clearly owned by the publisher, and as such the publisher should be named as the claimant.

If multiple authors contributed to the comic book as individual authors (not as joint authors or under a work made for hire agreement), and if it is unclear from the face of the deposit copy(ies) which author created what authorship and on what basis, the applicant should provide that information in the Author Created field of the online application or the Nature of Authorship space of the paper application. Such claims may require multiple separate applications to register the derivative authorship (e.g., an application for the pencil drawings and a separate application for the coloring of the preexisting drawings).

In some cases, comic book publishers license the use of another party’s characters and stories. In other cases, the publisher creates the stories, but the characters have been licensed. In such cases, the applicant should exclude the licensed characters and/or stories from the claim by stating “licensed character” or “licensed character and storyline” in the Material Excluded / Preexisting Materials field/space. The claimant should not name the licensor of the preexisting characters and/or stories as an author of the new text and artwork in the comic book.

The registration specialist will communicate with the applicant if the authorship or ownership information provided in the application is unclear or inconsistent with other statements in the application, the deposit copy(ies), or industry practice. In addition, the specialist may question whether a given work is a collective work or joint work, rather than a work consisting of separately owned contributions or works.

The Office will not register mere reprints, reissues, re-inks/letters/colors, or previously published, or previously registered comic books, unless the author contributed new copyrightable authorship in adapting or changing the preexisting content.
