<p class="big-text">Design patents protect the <em>appearance</em> of a design for <em>15 years</em>. They are relatively inexpensive and a surprisingly effective, for both industrial design and digital user interface design.</p>

<img src="/images/design-patent/famous-design-patent-mix.png" class="big-image">  


Designers have used these patents to protect renowned works like Clarence Fender's electric guitar, Adam Ziska's early Harley Davidson motorcycle, Charles Eames' iconic chairs, and even Christiansen's little lego man. Design patents also protect moderns works of high-tech and digital design like Google's famously simple search interface, and of course, every iteration of Steve Jobs and Jony Ives' iPhone.

# Law of Design Patents


**Application Process**. The design patent application is relatively simple. The most important component is a good set of drawings. The application process takes about a year from application to issuance (compare to 3-5 years for a utility patent). Budget about $2-3,000 in total costs for most design patents, and perhaps a little more for UI design patent. This is much cheaper than a utility patent, which runs between $8-20,000. 

**Non-Functional.** Where *utility* patents protection functional inventions, *design* patents protect "non-functional" inventions. Non-functional is defined loosely. The Design Patent Statute limits protection to the "ornamental" design of a product, but courts interpret “*ornamental*” to really mean “*non-functional*.” Other courts have further interpreted “non-functional designs” to mean something like any design that is not entirely dictated by function. In practice, most industrial designs are eligible for design patent protection, even if the designs are partly functional. 

   * The patent statute says design patents are available to protect the "[ornamental design for an article of manufacture](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/171)."

   * which really means design patents protect "non-functional designs"

   * which really means that design patents protect anything except designs solely "dictated by function."  

A design's *functionality* will only make it non-patentable if its overall appearance is "dictated by function." That is, if the design is governed *solely* by the product’s function, the design cannot be patented. On the other hand, if alternative designs are available for performing the same function, the design is [not dictated ](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5349194340358969962) solely by its function, and it can be patented.

**Easy Litigation**. Design patents are easy to enforce. The legal issues simply involve comparing the plaintiff’s design patent drawings to the defendant’s product. It doesn’t take an expensive team of experts to detect infringement or bring a case to trial. (Although expensive experts are often used in high-stakes design patent litigation, they are not necessarily required.) A judge or jury can simply compare the pictures in the plaintiff’s design patent to the defendant’s product.

**Infringement**. A design patent is infringed if "an ordinary observer, familiar with the prior art designs, would be deceived into believing that the accused product is the same as the patented design." [*Richardson v. Stanley Works*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4065677538492368378). 

**Prior Art**. Prior art is relevant to this comparison. The differences between the claimed design and the allegedly infringing design "are viewed in light of the prior art." Since the ordinary observer is viewing the designs in light of the prior art, her attention will be “drawn to those aspects of the claimed design that differ from the prior art.”  [*Crocs v. Int’l Trade Commission*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8466727333574506240). 

The closer the plaintiff’s design patent is to any prior art designs, the harder it is to show the defendant’s product is infringing. Where the prior art is similar to the design patent, even small differences between the design patent and the defendant’s design become important. "The ordinary observer, however, will likely attach importance to those differences depending on the overall effect of those differences on the design." [*Crocs v. Int’l Trade Commission*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8466727333574506240). 

In litigation, defendants frequently use prior art to chip away at the plaintiff’s design patents. For example, when Apple alleged that Samsung’s "Galaxy Tab" infringed an iPad design patent, Samsung replied by digging up examples of prior art tablets: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ipad-v-galaxy-tab-fidler-design-patent-compare.jpg" class="translucent">  

Samsung was making a simple argument: the Galaxy tab doesn’t copy Apple’s ‘889 design patent, its just using public-domain design elements like the prior art like the  a rectangle with rounded corners found in the 1994 "Fiddler" tablet. (It was a well-reasoned argument, but did not persuade the jury, who returned a verdict in Apple's favor to the tune of a billion dollars). 

**Penalty for Infringement**. The penalties for *design* patent infringement are large, and often larger than the damages in a comparable *utility* patent case.  This is because design patent damages are not "apportioned." In utility patent cases, [damages](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/284) are awarded in proportion to the extent that the infringing feature drove the defendant’s profits. But for design patent infringement, there is no such reduction. Instead, the plaintiff is awarded the infringer’s “[total profit](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/289).”

The design patent owner may also be awarded an "injunction" – a court order forbidding the defendant from selling any products that use the plaintiff’s patented design.

## Design Patent Drawings

The drawings are the heart of a design patent. They define the design that is being protected. In design patent drawings, the difference between solid lines and dashed lines is critical. *Solid lines* identify the parts of the design that are actually protected by the patent. *Dashed lines* are used to show context or environment.

Solid lines represent protected design elements, but the more solid lines in a drawing, the narrower the protection it affords. This is because a competitor's product is only infringing if it incorporates *every* element shown in solid lines. Here's a simplified example: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/solid-v-dashed-line-in-design-patent-example.png" class="translucent">  

Compare the "patent" drawing in the upper left to the "product" in the upper-right. The patent (upper-left) shows a square and a triangle in solid lines. Since the product (upper-right) doesn’t have a triangle, its not infringing the patent. 

Now look at the patent in the lower-left. It has a square drawn in solid lines, and a triangle in dashed lines. This time, we ignore the triangle. Since the product has the matching square elemenft, it is infringing the design patent. More dashed lines leads to stronger protection.

## Design Patents Compared to Other Intellectual Property

Design patents are a strange amalgam of utility patents, copyrights, and trademarks. This section discusses the differences, and how these different IP rights can conflict or overlap. 

### Utility Patent vs. Design Patent

A utility patent protects *functional* aspects of an invention, while a design patent protects new *nonfunctional designs*. As the [statute](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/171) puts it, any "new, original and ornamental design for an article of manufacture" may be granted a 15 year design patent.

Design patent applications are cheaper and faster than utility patent applications. A design patent application costs about $2-4,000 (total) and takes about a year to issue. A utility patent application costs between $8,000-20,000 (total) and lingers in the Patent Office for around 3 years before being issued as a patent. 

To distinguish between a utility patent and a design patent, look at the patent number. If it starts with the letter "D" or “USD”, it's a design patent. The design patent document is generally much shorter than a utility patent document. Design patents have a page or two of text followed by several drawings. Utility patents are bloated with long-winded written descriptions of technology and prior art. 

Many designs can be protected by other design patents and utility patents. For example, this Eames Chair was patented as both a design patent and utility patent: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/eames-chair-design-and-utility-patent-1947.png" class="translucent">  

Likewise, interactive UI design elements can be protected by both utility patents and design patents. For example, [pull-to-refresh](https://www.google.com/patents/US8448084) is a utility patent.  As is Apple’s [pinch-to-zoom](http://www.google.com/patents/US7469381) patent. 

### Copyright vs. Design Patents

Copyright can protect many types of creative works, but this discussion will be limited to copyrighting software, UI elements, and works of industrial design. 

**Non-Functional**. Both copyrights and design patents protect *non-functional* designs. Copyright law applies the non-functional requirement rigorously, while design patent law is lax about what it considers "non-functional." Copyright protection rarely applies to a design that is even *partly* functional. But design patent protection can apply to functional aspects of UI designs and industrial designs. 

**Duration.** Copyright protection lasts longer. Design patents protect industrial design for 15 years. Copyrights protect works of creative authorship for 95 years (often more, but sometimes less, according to some [complicated rules](http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-duration.html)).

**Infringement**. A copyright can only be infringed if there is "copying." That is, the infringer must have *seen* the original copyrighted work at some point. Coincidental similarity is not enough for copyright infringement.  Design patents can be infringed by sheer coincidence. For example, someone who has never seen an iPhone or Apple’s design patents can still infringe them. Unlike copyright, there is no “fair use” defense for design patent infringement.


### Trademark vs. Design Patent

Trade dress, a branch of trademark law, can also protect the non-functional appearance of a product, software design or of certain types of UI elements. But trade dress law revolves around *brand identification* and protecting business *reputations*. Trade dress rights are more difficult to establish than design patent rights, and are not well suited for protecting UI elements. 

**Infringement**. The owner of trade dress rights can prevent a second company from using design elements that are so similar to the protected design that consumers will be confused into thinking the second company’s product is made by the first company, or that the second company is somehow associated with the first company. Put differently, trade dress is infringed if a defendant’s design will confuse consumers into thinking the defendant’s product is actually made by–or somehow associated with–the plaintiff. 

**Functionality**. Trade dress only protects non-functional aspects of a design. Like copyright law (and unlike design patent law), this prohibition against protecting functional design elements is strictly enforced. In litigation, a trade dress plaintiff is required to prove that the trade dress is non-functional. In design patent litigation, a judge will presume the plaintiff’s design patent is nonfunctional, and the defendant can only disprove it with clear and convincing evidence.  

**Perpetual**. Trade dress rights, once established, can be perpetual. Unlike design patents, trade dress rights do not have a set expiration date. Trade dress rights will only expire when a company stops using the trade dress designs to sell a product.

## UI Design Patent Examples

Design patents can protect user interface icons, layouts, fonts, UI controls, transitions and a variety of  animations, swipes and gestures. These UI design patents are particularly important in modern design. "As far as the customer is concerned, [the interface *is* the product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin)", and owning a unique user interface can provide significant market power.  The UI Design patent examples below simply demonstrate how companies are using design patents to protect their UI elements. They are not necessarily examples of great design.  

### UI Layouts

Design patents for UI layouts are among the more interesting and important type of UI design patents. A clunky UI makes selecting files, navigating menus and launching applications a frustrating chore. But innovative techniques, especially for tablet devices, can make these tasks easier. 

Adobe patented the layout of its iOS file selection system in [D’628](http://www.google.com/patents/USD691628). Note the use of dashed lines to depict the tablet: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/adobe-ios-selection-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

- - - 

Facebook is more aggressive with its dashed lines. [D’621](http://www.google.com/patents/USD691622), Facebook’s recent "status update" UI design patent uses dashed lines for the computer monitor and all of the text. The solid lines– showing the patented portion of the Facebooks UI–are limited to a  few rectangles. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/facebook-status-update-ui-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

- - - 

Apple is famously aggressive in its pursuit of UI design patents. Apple’s  ‘[666](https://www.google.com/patents/USD668666) design patent (left) protects UI with a bottom row of icons. Other than the 4 icons, everything else is drawn in dashed lines. Apple’s [D’864](http://www.google.com/patents/usd660864) patent (right) is similarly sparse. It protects a UI with a few rows of icons, in the proportions of iOS on an iPad.  

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-design-patent-for-gui-with-4-icons-in-row-iphone-ipad-compare.png" class="translucent">

Google has a design patent on its famously simple [landing page ](https://www.google.com/patents/USD599372)and search box ([discussed at Patently-O](http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2009/09/googles-patent-on-its-googlecom-home-page.html) blog). While the "Google" logo is shown in broken lines, much of the other text is shown in solid lines. It would be fairly easy to design a search page that looked like Google but did not infringe on this particular design patent. (Don't try this at home)

 
<figure class="half">

<img src="/images/design-patent/google-search-box-gui-example.png" class="translucent">  

</figure>

### Animated UI Elements 

Design patents can protect animations and transitions as well as layouts. The way a layout adapts to a new context or to user input is often a key UI innovation. 

Apple’s [iBooks page turn](https://www.google.com/patents/USD670713) is an animated design patent shown in 3 positions. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-page-turn-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

[iOS Keyboard Animation](https://www.google.com/patents/USD621848) shows how a key gives user-feedback by way of an expanding bubble above the selected key.  

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-keyboard-animated-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

[Swipe to Unlock](http://www.google.com/patents/USD675639). Some people found the swipe to unlock design patent too bland and obvious to merit patent protection. Setting aside these objections, Swipe-to-Unlock is a good example of how to use a design patent to claim an animated UI element. Swipe to unlock also shows the UI feature in two different modes: ready (fig. 3) and activated (fig.4). Many other animated UI design patents can be claimed with a similar series of drawings. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-slide-to-unlock-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

Most of the design patent is dashed lines. This carefully defines the patent rights, and limits them to the solid-line "swipe bar." Because of the dashed lines, this patent protects Apple against use of *any* similar swipe bar, regardless of what the rest of the OS looks like.

### Icons

Facebook has a design patent on its two-silhouette "friend" icon. Notice that every detail except the icon is shown in dashed lines. This design patent only covers the icon. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/facebook-user-icon-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

### Fonts and Typography 

Fonts can be patented. Adobe regularly secures design patents for its fonts. This is particularly important because copyright law does not protect fonts themselves (although copyright will protect the *software* that draws fonts). Here are two examples of typeface design patents. The first is from Robert Slimbach, and I think it's for an italic Garamond(?). The second is from Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes, for a Lucida Sans(?). 

<img src="/images/design-patent/adobe-font-design-patent.png" class="translucent">

<img src="/images/design-patent/typeface-patent-bigelow-and-holmes-lucida-1987.png" class="translucent">

In addition to UI layouts, dashboards, animations, transitions, icons and typography, design patents can be used to protect nearly any other type of UI or UX element.

# Design Patent Strategies

Since design patents provide a potent legal right, and are relatively affordable, they should play a role in the IP portfolio of nearly any company with consumer-facing products. For certain products, design patents can be combined with utility patents, with copyright registrations, and/or with trade dress registrations to round out the intellectual property portfolio. 

## Design Patent Strategies for Industrial Design 

When developing a product, think about which design features are new and innovative, and which design features will entice consumers to make a purchase. Where there is overlap, a design patent may be appropriate. Identify the portions of the design that are most likely to attract consumers. Each of these portions may merit its own separate design patent. In these separate design patents, most of the overall design should be depicted in dashed lines, while only the individual highlighted component is shown in solid lines. 

**Combine with Trade Dress**. Design patents can also be used to jump-start trade dress protection. While design patents last for 15 years, trade dress does not expire until the product design is abandoned.  

**Combine with Copyright**. Design patents can also be combined with copyright protection. Designers should consider registration of the copyright in their designs, as a 3 dimensional sculpture, to further bolster the intellectual property portfolio. 

**Packaging**. Design patents can touch nearly any part of the user experience. Companies that invest in their packaging design and unboxing experience should strongly consider design patent applications for their packaging. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/macbook-unboxing-design-patent-2014.png" class="translucent">  


## Digital User Interface Design Patent Strategies

Major tech companies like Apple, Samsung and Microsoft pursue UI design patents in a big way. [Microsoft](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=0&f=S&l=50&d=PTXT&RS=%28AN%2Fsamsung+AND+%28%28%28%28%28%28%28%28%28%28CCL%2FD14%2F485+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F486%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F487%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F488%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F489%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F490%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F490%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F491%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F492%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F493%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F494%29%29&Refine=Refine+Search&Refine=Refine+Search&Query=AN%2Fmicrosoft+AND+%28CCL%2FD14%2F485+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F486+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F487+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F488+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F489+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F490+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F490+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F491+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F492+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F493+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F494%29) is aggressively growing its portfolio of 1,800 UI design patents.

Smaller companies can follow this focused patent strategy by carefully selecting its best UI design features for patenting. Founders can focus their resources on acquiring the highest value design patents. Start thinking about design patents as your startup moves from generic frameworks to custom UI elements. A lean startup launching a [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) from pre-packaged frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) might not have  much *new* design to protect. But when it starts to customize its user interface–especially with innovative design elements or layouts–it should start thinking about design patents. 

For critical user interface elements, think about your information architecture, navigation structure, buttons, icon and transitions. Which elements came from a pre-packaged framework? Which ones did you design from the ground up? 

Produce several drawings, and carefully distinguish the custom UI design elements from the pre-packaged elements. Depict custom elements in solid lines, and the standard elements in broken lines.

Drill down into the design. How granular can you make the custom elements before they just become standard design objects? If you can identify several granular UI levels that are not just off-the-shelf elements, you can file several design patents. In each of these design patents, only one of the granular design components should be depicted in solid lines. 

If you have existing *utility* patent applications, you can use them as a springboard for design patents. You can pull *design* patents out of the existing utility patent drawings, and even benefit from the earlier filing date of your utility patent application. 

A company’s unique UI design may be one of its most valuable assets. Without design patents, the UI design may be left unprotected. *Copyrights* alone are not enough. While copyright can protect creative designs, copying is subject to a number of fair use limitations. *Trademarks* alone are not enough. This type of trademark right, called "trade dress", is difficult to establish. It generally requires 5 years of heavy marketing to properly associate a startup’s UI design with its brand, and thus achieve some level of trade dress protection ([some exceptions apply](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?&case=12034599115584297601)).

# Conclusion

Creating engaging design can be a slow, iterative, and research intensive process.  If you’re investing resources, and you want some degree of reasonable protection, consider a handful of design patents.
