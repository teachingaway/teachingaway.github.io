Design patents protect works of industrial design. Famous designers have used design patents to protect iconic works, from the the DC-3 transport plane, to Adam Ziska's early Harley Davidson motorcycle, to Charles Eames' iconic furniture, to Clarence Fender's electric guitar, down to Godtfred Christiansen's little lego man. Design patents also protect moderns works of high-tech design and digital design, like Google's famously simple search interface, and of course, every iteration of Steve Jobs and Jony Ives' iPhone.

Anyone investing in a new product design or interface should know some basic design patent law.




This post has 3 parts. First, we discuss the basics of **design patent law** and how design patents stack up against utility patents, copyright and trademarks. Second, we give some **examples** of how companies use design patents to protect industrial design as well as digital design and UI/UX.  Finally, we discuss how design patents can be used to develop market power as part of a robust intellectual property **portfolio**. 

If you ever find yourself on the receiving end of a design patent lawsuit, a little background knowledge can help contain the damage.

# Law of Design Patents

Design patents protect the *appearance* of a design, and the protection lasts for *15 years*. They are relatively inexpensive, easy to enforce, and infringement can result in monetary penalties.  

**Application Process**. Design patents take about a year from application to issuance (compare to 3-5 years for a utility patent). Budget about $3-4,000 in total costs for a typical UI design patent (a utility patent is more expensive, maybe $8-20,000). 

**Somewhat Non-Functional.** Where utility patents protection functional inventions, design patents protect non-functional inventions. Or at least mostly-non-functional inventions. The Design Patent Statute limits protection to the "ornamental" design of a product. But courts interpret “*ornamental*” to really mean “*non-functional*.” Other courts have further interpreted “non-functional designs” to mean something like any design that is not entirely dictated by function. In practice, most UI elements are eligible for design patent protection, even if the designs are partly functional. 

A design will only be non-patentable if its overall appearance is "dictated by function." That is, if the design is governed *solely* by the product’s function, the design cannot be patented. On the other hand, if alternative designs are available for performing the same function, the design is [not dictated ](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5349194340358969962)solely by its function, and it can be patented.

* The patent statute says design patents are available to protect the "[ornamental design for an article of manufacture](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/171)."

* which really means design patents protect "non-functional designs"

* which really means that design patents protect anything except designs solely "dictated by function."  

**Easy Litigation**. Design patents are easy to enforce. The legal issues simply involve comparing the plaintiff’s design patent drawings to the defendant’s product. It doesn’t take an expensive team of experts to detect infringement or bring a case to trial. (Although expensive experts are often used in high-stakes design patent litigation, they are not necessarily required.) A judge or jury can simply compare the pictures in the plaintiff’s design patent to the defendant’s product.

**Infringement**. A design patent is infringed if "an ordinary observer, familiar with the prior art designs, would be deceived into believing that the accused product is the same as the patented design." [*Richardson v. Stanley Works*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4065677538492368378). 

**Prior Art**. Prior art is relevant to this comparison. The differences between the claimed design and the allegedly infringing design "are viewed in light of the prior art." Since the ordinary observer is viewing the designs in light of the prior art, her attention will be “drawn to those aspects of the claimed design that differ from the prior art.”  [*Crocs v. Int’l Trade Commission*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8466727333574506240). 

The closer the plaintiff’s design patent is to any prior art designs, the harder it is to show the defendant’s product is infringing. Where the prior art is similar to the design patent, even small differences between the design patent and the defendant’s design become important. "The ordinary observer, however, will likely attach importance to those differences depending on the overall effect of those differences on the design." [*Crocs v. Int’l Trade Commission*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8466727333574506240). 

In litigation, defendants frequently use prior art to reduce the potency of the plaintiff’s design patents. When Apple alleged that Samsung’s Galaxy tab infringed an iPad design patent, Samsung replied by digging up examples of prior art tablets. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ipad-v-galaxy-tab-fidler-design-patent-compare.jpg" class="translucent">  

Samsung was making a simple argument: the Galaxy tab doesn’t copy Apple’s ‘889 design patent, its just using public-domain design elements like the prior art like the  a rectangle with rounded corners found in the 1994 "Fiddler" tablet. 

**Infringement Consequences**. The penalties for *design* patent infringement are large, and often larger than the damages in a comparable *utility* patent case.  This is because design patent damages are not "apportioned." In utility patent cases, [damages](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/284) are awarded in proportion to the extent that the infringing feature drove the defendant’s profits. But for design patent infringement, there is no such reduction. Instead, the plaintiff is awarded the infringer’s “*[total profit*](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/289).”

The design patent owner may also be awarded an "injunction" – a court order forbidding the defendant from selling any products that use the plaintiff’s patented design.

## Design Patent Drawings

The drawings are the heart of a design patent. They define the design that is being protected. 

In design patent drawings, the difference between solid lines and dashed lines is critical. *Solid lines* identify the parts of the design that are actually protected by the patent. *Dashed lines* are used to show context or environment.

Solid lines represent protected design elements, but the more solid lines in a drawing, the narrower the protection it affords. This is a counterintuitive concept and merits some explanation. 

More solid lines in a design patent drawing generates narrower protection because an infringing product must incorporate each element shown in solid lines, not just some of them. 

Compare the "patent" drawing in the upper left to the “product in the upper-right. The patent shows a square and a triangle in solid lines. Since the product doesn’t have a triangle, its not infringing the patent. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/solid-v-dashed-line-in-design-patent-example.png" class="translucent">  

Now look at the patent in the lower-left. It has a square drawn in solid lines, and a triangle in dashed lines. This time, we ignore the triangle. Since the product has the matching square element, its infringing the design patent. 

More dashed lines leads to stronger protection. A real-life example from *Apple v. Samsung* will help explain: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/iphone-v-samsung-lozenge-design-patent-compare.png" class="translucent">  

Apple’s D’087 patent uses *solid* lines to depict the shape of its microphone (a rounded-rectangle) but *dashed* lines for its circular home button. This means that the circular home button (dashed) is not considered in the infringement analysis. Samsung’s phones can’t avoid infringement by using a non-circular home button. 

The microphone in Apple’s patent is drawn in *solid* lines. So Samsung can only infringe if its product incorporates a microphone with the same rounded-rectangle shape. Samsung argued this point at trial, and highlighted the differences between the Samsung microphone shape and the Apple microphone shape. This would be a winning strategy for Samsung, if the shapes were actually different. The jury thought Samsung’s microphone was just another rounded-rectangle. Maybe if Samsung’s microphone was a pure rectangle it could have avoided design patent infringement. 

Apple’s D’087 patent could have been even stronger by showing the microphone in dashed lines. If the microphone was shown in dashed lines, a competitors phone would be infringing if it used the design shown in solid lines, regardless of what shape it used for its microphone or home button. In short, dashed lines make design patents stronger by making it easier to prove infringement.

## Design Patents Compared to Other Intellectual Property

Design patents are a strange amalgam of utility patents, copyrights, and trademarks. This section discusses the differences, and how these different IP rights can conflict or overlap. 

### Utility Patent vs. Design Patent

A utility patent protects *functional* aspects of an invention, while a design patent protects new *nonfunctional designs*. As the [statute](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/171) puts it, any "new, original and ornamental design for an article of manufacture" may be granted a 15 year design patent.

Design patent applications are cheaper and faster than utility patent applications. A design patent application costs about $3-4,000 (total) and takes about a year to issue. A utility patent application costs between $8,000-20,000 (total) and lingers in the Patent Office for around 3 years before being issued as a patent. 

To distinguish between a utility patent and a design patent, look at the patent number. If it starts with the letter "D" or “USD”, its a design patent. The design patent document is generally much shorter than a utility patent document. Design patents have a page or two of text followed by several drawings. Utility patents are bloated with long-winded written descriptions. 

Interactive UI design elements can be protected with by both utility patents and design patents. For example, [pull-to-refresh](https://www.google.com/patents/US8448084) is a utility patent.  As is Apple’s [pinch-to-zoom](http://www.google.com/patents/US7469381) patent. 

### Copyright vs. Design Patents

Copyright can protect many types of creative works, but this discussion will be limited to copyrighting software, UI elements, and works of industrial design. 

**Non-Functional**. Both copyrights and design patents protect *non-functional* designs. Copyright law applies the non-functional requirement rigorously, while design patent law is lax about what it considers "non-functional." Copyright protection rarely applies to a design that is even *partly* functional. But design patent protection can apply to functional aspects of UI designs and industrial designs. 

**Duration.** Copyright protection lasts longer. Design patents protect industrial design for 15 years. Copyrights protect works of creative authorship for 95 years (often more, but sometimes less, according to some [complicated rules](http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-duration.html)).

**Infringement**. The rules for infringement are different. Copyright infringement requires "copying." That is, an infringer must have seen the original copyrighted work at some point. Design patents can be infringed by sheer coincidence. For example, someone who has never seen an iPhone or Apple’s design patents can still infringe them. And, unlike copyright, there is no “fair use” defense for design patent infringement.

Copyright only protects designs that have been expressed in a "tangible medium." That is, the design needs to be real and actually executed. A design patent doesn't. A design patent can protect a purely hypothetical design; a design that hasn't yet been executed in a product. 

### Trademark vs. Design Patent

Trade dress, a branch of trademark law, can also protect the non-functional appearance of a product, software design or of certain types of UI elements. But trade dress law revolves around *brand identification* and protecting business *reputations*. Trade dress rights are more difficult to establish than design patent rights, and are not well suited for protecting UI elements. 

**Infringement**. The owner of trade dress rights can prevent a second company from using design elements that are so similar to the protected design that consumers will be confused into thinking the second company’s product is made by the first company, or that the second company is somehow associated with the first company. Put differently, trade dress is infringed if a defendant’s design will confuse consumers into thinking the defendant’s product is actually made by–or somehow associated with–the plaintiff. 

**Functionality**. Trade dress only protects non-functional aspects of a design. Like copyright law (and unlike design patent law), this prohibition against protecting functional design elements is strictly enforced. In litigation, a trade dress plaintiff is required to prove that the trade dress is non-functional. In design patent litigation, a judge will presume the plaintiff’s design patent is nonfunctional, and the defendant can only disprove it with clear and convincing evidence.  

**Perpetual**. Trade dress rights, once established, can be perpetual. Unlike design patents, trade dress rights do not have a set expiration date. Trade dress rights will only expire when a company stops using the trade dress designs to sell a product. 

**For Particular Products**. Each grant of trade dress rights is limited to a particular type or category of product. Design patents are not so narrowly limited. For example, Google’s trade dress rights for its  landing page will prevent other people from using a similar design for a search engine, but perhaps not from using a similar design for a launchrock page, where the simple input box is for an email signup rather than search input (This is just an example, don’t try this at home).

## UI Design Patent Examples

Design patents can protect user interface icons, layouts, fonts, UI controls, transitions and a variety of  animations, swipes and gestures. These UI design patents can be particularly important. "[As far as the customer is concerned, the interface *is* the product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin)", and owning a unique user interface can provide significant market power.  The UI Design patent examples below simply demonstrate how companies are using design patents to protect their UI elements. They are not necessarily examples of great design.  

**Basics**. The Patent Office likes to call UI design patents "Generated Images" (short for computer-generated images).  The Patent Office also has a strange requirement that UI design patents need to be shown within a computer screen or some similar physical context. 

**Classification**. The Patent Office classifies patents by technology-type in a wonky, multi-tier taxonomy. UI design patents tend to fall within USPTO class [D14/486](http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/uspcd14/defsd14.htm#CD14S485000). Under the US patent classification system, D14/486 is defined to include: 

* **D14**: Recording, Communication or Information Retrieval Equipment

    * **D14/485 Generated Image**: Design for electronically produced symbol for computer that may be viewed on a computer screen.

        * **D14/486 Drop down menu or full screen menu type**: Design for image that fills the entire display area of a computer screen or within a strictly defined area therein.

### UI Layouts

Design patents for UI layouts are among the more interesting and important type of UI design patents. A clunky UI makes selecting files, navigating menus and launching applications a frustrating chore. But innovative techniques, especially for tablet devices, can make these tasks easier. 

Adobe patented the layout of its iOS file selection system in [D’628](http://www.google.com/patents/USD691628). Note the use of dashed lines to depict the tablet: 

<img src="/images/design-patent/adobe-ios-selection-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

Facebook is more aggressive with its dashed lines. [D’621](http://www.google.com/patents/USD691622), Facebook’s recent "status update" UI design patent uses dashed lines for the computer monitor and all of the text. The solid lines– showing the patented portion of the Facebooks UI–are limited to a  few rectangles. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/facebook-status-update-ui-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

Apple is famously aggressive in its pursuit of UI design patents. Apple’s  ‘[666](https://www.google.com/patents/USD668666) design patent (left) protects UI with a bottom row of icons. Other than the 4 icons, everything else is drawn in dashed lines. Apple’s [D’864](http://www.google.com/patents/usd660864) patent (right) is similarly sparse. It protects a UI with a few rows of icons, in the proportions of iOS on an iPad.  

<figure class="half">

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-design-patent-for-gui-with-4-icons-in-row.png" class="translucent"> 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-ipad-home-screen-design-patent.jpg" class="translucent">

</figure>

 
**Google** has a design patent on its famously simple [landing page ](https://www.google.com/patents/USD599372)and search box ([discussed at Patently-O](http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2009/09/googles-patent-on-its-googlecom-home-page.html) blog). While the "Google" logo is shown in broken lines, much of the other text is shown in solid lines. It would be fairly easy to design a search page that looked like Google but did not infringe on this particular design patent. (Don't try this at home)

<figure class="half">

<img src="/images/design-patent/google-search-box-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

<img src="/images/design-patent/google-search-box-gui-example.png" class="translucent">  

</figure>

Google has also patented the layout of its search results, of Google Maps elements like its "[teardrop shaped marker icon](https://www.google.com/patents/USD621413)", and of Android design elements like its [chat bubbles](https://www.google.com/patents/USD685384). Google even a patent on the layout of [Google Patents](https://www.google.com/patents/USD591304).

### Animated UI Elements 

Design patents can protect animations and transitions as well as layouts. The way a layout adapts to a new context or to user input is often a key UI innovation. 

Apple’s [iBooks page turn](https://www.google.com/patents/USD670713) is an animated design patent shown in 3 positions. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-page-turn-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

[iOS Keyboard Animation](https://www.google.com/patents/USD621848) shows how a key gives user-feedback by way of an expanding bubble above the selected key.  

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-keyboard-animated-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  


[Swipe to Unlock](http://www.google.com/patents/USD675639). Some people found the swipe to unlock design patent too bland and obvious to merit patent protection. Setting aside these objections, Swipe-to-Unlock is a good example of how to use a design patent to claim an animated UI element. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/ios-slide-to-unlock-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

Most of the design patent is dashed lines. This carefully defines the patent rights, and limits them to the solid-line "swipe bar." (because of the dashed lines, this patent protects against use of a similar swipe bar, regardless of what the rest of the OS looks like). 

Swipe to unlock also shows the UI feature in two different modes: ready (fig. 3) and activated (fig.4). Many other animated UI design patents can be claimed with a similar series of drawings.

### Controls 

Autodesk’s [tour building wheel](http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2010/ENU/AutoCAD%202010%20User%20Documentation/index.html?url=WS73099cc142f48755-4607e7cc11b1cfff571794.htm,topicNumber=d0e28487) (left) is a nice example of an arrangement of complicated controls. It uses different shapes and sizes to differentiate buttons. The purpose and functionality of autodesk's 3d Roller Ball control (right) is less obvious to me. 

<figure class="half">

<img src="/images/design-patent/auto-desk-3d-roller-ball-design-patent.png" class="translucent">

### Icons

Facebook has a design patent on its two-silhouette "friend" icon. Notice that every detail except the icon is shown in dashed lines. This design patent only covers the icon. 

<img src="/images/design-patent/facebook-user-icon-design-patent.png" class="translucent">  

### Fonts and Typography 

Fonts can be patented. Adobe regularly secures design patents for its fonts. This is particularly important because copyright law does not protect fonts (although copyright will protect the *software* that draws fonts). 

<img src="/images/design-patent/adobe-font-design-patent.png" class="translucent">

# Design Patent Strategies

Since design patents provide a potent legal right, and are relatively affordable, they should play a role in the IP portfolio of nearly any company with consumer-facing products. For certain products, design patents can be combined with utility patents, with copyright registrations, and/or with trade dress registrations to round out the intellectual property portfolio. 

## Design Patent Strategies for Industrial Design 

When developing a product, think about which design features are new and innovative, and which design features will entice consumers to make a purchase. Where there is overlap, a design patent may be appropriate. 


## Digital User Interface Design Patent Strategies

Major tech companies like Apple, Samsung and Microsoft pursue UI design patents in a big way. [Microsoft](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=0&f=S&l=50&d=PTXT&RS=%28AN%2Fsamsung+AND+%28%28%28%28%28%28%28%28%28%28CCL%2FD14%2F485+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F486%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F487%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F488%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F489%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F490%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F490%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F491%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F492%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F493%29+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F494%29%29&Refine=Refine+Search&Refine=Refine+Search&Query=AN%2Fmicrosoft+AND+%28CCL%2FD14%2F485+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F486+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F487+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F488+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F489+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F490+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F490+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F491+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F492+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F493+OR+CCL%2FD14%2F494%29) is aggressively growing its portfolio of 1,800 UI design patents.

Startups can follow this focused patent strategy by carefully selecting its best UI design features for patenting. Founders can focus their resources on acquiring the highest value design patents. 

A company’s unique UI design may be one of its most valuable assets. Without design patents, the UI design may be left unprotected. *Copyrights* alone are not enough. While copyright can protect creative designs, copying is subject to a number of fair use limitations. *Trademarks* alone are not enough. This type of trademark right, called "trade dress", is difficult to establish. It generally requires 5 years of heavy marketing to properly associate a startup’s UI design with its brand, and thus achieve some level of trade dress protection. ([but not always](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?&case=12034599115584297601). )  

Design patents can be used in combination with utility patents, trademarks and copyrights. These different types of intellectual property provide overlapping protections and result in more robust protection and opportunities for enforcement.

## When to Start the Design Patent Process

Start thinking about design patents as your startup moves from generic frameworks to custom UI elements. A lean startup launching a [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) from pre-packaged frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) might not have  much *new* design to protect. But when it starts to customize its user interface–especially with innovative design elements or layouts–it should start thinking about design patents. 

For critical user interface elements, think about your information architecture, navigation structure, buttons, icon and transitions. Which elements came from a pre-packaged framework? Which ones did you design from the ground up? 

Produce several drawings, and carefully distinguish the custom UI design elements from the pre-packaged elements. Depict custom elements in solid lines, and the standard elements in broken lines.

Drill down into the design. How granular can you make the custom elements before they just become standard design objects? If you can identify several granular UI levels that are not just off-the-shelf elements, you can file several design patents. In each of these design patents, only one of the granular design components should be depicted in solid lines. 

If you have existing *utility* patent applications, you can use them as a springboard for design patents. You can pull *design* patents out of the existing utility patent drawings, and even benefit from the earlier utility patent application filing date (that is, the potential universe of prior art that can be used against your design patent is limited to prior art dated before your earlier utility patent).

<h1> Conclusion</h1>

Creating engaging design can be a slow, iterative, and research intensive process.  If you’re investing resources, and you want some degree of reasonable protection, consider a handful of design patents.

But since the best UI designs tend to be [invisible](http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/24/3177332/ia-oliver-reichenstein-writer-interview-good-design-is-invisible), UI design patents are a tricky animal. 

Not every product needs to be "unique." Some designers shortcut painstaking design research and A/B testing by just imitating a popular design experience. When you intend to donate an original design concept to the public conversation, imitation is sincere flattery. Other products may remix and riff off your original designs. But the boundary between riffing and ripping-off is hard to define. Design patents, used carefully, can facilitate a design conversation while discouraging design plagiarism.
