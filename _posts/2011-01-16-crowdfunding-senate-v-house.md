<p class="big-text">Hard as it may be to believe, it seems there is a fighting chance that a crowdfunding exemption may actually become law. The House passed <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c112:4:./temp/~c112xvFR9F::">a version</a> on November 3, and a Senate <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.1791:">version</a> has been introduced by <a href="http://scottbrown.senate.gov/public/">Senator Brown</a>. I had the pleasure of contributing some ideas and language to the Senate bill.</p>

Although the two bills are similar and can probably be reconciled without too much dissension, the Senate bill has some structural advantages that retain the spirit of crowdfunding and discourage abuse, which I would like to see make it into any final law.

Warning, this post is long and tedious.

<strong>Individual Investment Limits</strong>

The heart of crowdfunding is putting your idea out to the masses and letting the wisdom of the crowd and not the old gatekeepers of capital decide your investment worthiness.  Small investment limits are what make this process work. There is some talk out there that the Senate bill, by capping individual investment at $1,000, would keep away real big money “accredited” investors who would not be interested in such a measly investment opportunity. I agree. An exemption cannot be all things to all issuers and investors. Accredited investors have Rule 506; that’s their territory. There is a movement to get rid of the ban on general solicitation for Rule 506 accredited investor offerings, which would help equalize access to investors among the less “connected” aspiring entrepreneurs out there.

The House bill in contrast would allow investments up to the lesser of $10,000 or 10% of the investor’s annual income. That is a lot to an average person, and by allowing investors to certify their own income, you will have people falsifying this information to be able to invest more money (think stated income home loans); significant losses would inevitably ensue and then lawyers would have to get involved.

<strong>Use of Crowdfunding Platform “Intermediaries”</strong>

Both the House and Senate bill contemplate the use of “intermediaries,” third party crowdfunding platforms, to conduct any offerings. The Senate bill, however, would actually require the use of an intermediary, which I believe is a better way to go to, both deter fraud and stop issuers from getting in over their head.

The compliance requirements for intermediaries are largely the same in both bills and contain some solid provisions that would deter fraud. These include, among others, (I) requiring out-sourcing of cash-management to a third-party custodian, (II) holding raised funds until 60% of issuer’s target has been met, (III) having investors answer questions demonstrating an understanding of some investment risks, and (IV) providing notices and information to the SEC.  Investors will lose money, that is for sure, but it is hard to see how fraud would run rampant in such a system.

The House bill would allow issuers to conduct their own offerings with similar requirements, however, this may be asking too much of a new or small company. Many issuers would inevitably not meet some condition and would lose their exemption. A direct issuer offering would require a lot of lawyerly assistance, which a crowdfunding platform could provide much cheaper with built in interfaces and relationships. I think you would also see some great new opportunities for related shareholder service companies to help issuers manage their shareholder relations.

<strong>Re-Sale Restrictions</strong>

Both the House and Senate versions restrict the re-sale of crowdfunding securities.  The House imposes a straight and simple 1 year ban on re-sale, except back to the issuer or to an accredited investor. The Senate accomplishes the same in effect by defining crowdfunded securities as “restricted securities” with a 1 year holding period. I think that the Senate’s use of the existing “restricted securities” framework and Rule 144 is a preferable approach since there are established rules for re-sales that us lawyers have grown comfortable with. There is no need to start from scratch.

[Note: The House bill may actually (by accident?) result in the securities being deemed restricted, as Rule 144 stills refers to the old Section 4(6) that no longer exists, but would be replaced by the crowdfunding exemption.]

<strong>Issuers in Corporate Form</strong>

The Senate bill requires any crowdfunding issuer to be a corporation formed under and subject to the law of a state. The House has no specific requirement on the legal form of the issuer. While I think there are good business structures other than a corporation, a corporation remains the most commonly understood type of entity among the public (and lawyers). LLCs are great, but there are reasons that most professional investors strongly prefer a corporation, taxes being a big one.

<strong>Fraud Prevention—Federal Preemption of State Regulatory Authority</strong><em></em>

It is no surprise that state regulators are not fans of including crowdfunded securities in the definition of “covered security” subject to federal preemption of state regulation. State regulators deal with the brunt of small-time securities fraud and seem to have a pretty cynical view about allowing any business to go unregulated. Read through some state securities enforcement actions and you will see some bad cases of fraud, but you will also see cases of small companies that simply didn’t think they were selling securities (a topic for another day) and/or got mixed up trying to comply with the rules.

The problem is that creating an exemption doesn’t open up a new means of legalized fraud; fraud is and will remain illegal with or without a securities law exemption. Crowdfunding is unique in that it is designed to limit any one individual’s losses to a manageable amount. It is easier to find a few suckers to invest a lot than it is to find many to invest a little. Surely, some ambitious entrepreneurs will overstate their accomplishments and play down the risks, but if you have read a prospectus lately you’ll know this is nothing new.

<strong>Preemption and State Notice Filings</strong><em></em>

While “covered securities” are exempt from state regulation, under the preemption rules any state where the securities are offered or sold can still require the filing of any document filed with the SEC and charge a filing fee (typically $250-$300 for a Rule 506 offering). This is problematic for crowdfunding because the securities will essentially be offered in all 50 states and therefore potentially subject to 50 state filings and fees.

The Senate version addresses this by expressly limiting notice filings and fees to the issuer’s state of incorporation and any state “in which 50 percent or greater of the aggregate amount of the issue are residents.” Although the House bill provides that the SEC will make an issuer’s federal notice filings available to the states, it is not clear if this is intended or sufficient to preempt state notice filings. States are not going to give up their filings and fees voluntarily.

<strong>Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act</strong><em></em>

I have to take one last little technical issue with the House bill in its creation of a carve-out to Section 12(g) registration. As the Exchange Act now provides, once a company gets to 500 shareholders and $10M in assets it has to register as a public company. I have no problem with exempting crowdfunded companies from this registration rule, but the House’s method is clunky and may cause unforeseen issues by creating a new Section 12(g)(5)(B) which would define crowdfunded securities as not being “held of record.” I think a better route would be to simply direct the SEC to make an exemption by rule, which could be added to existing Rule 12(h)-1.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I am excited about the possibility of easing the path between ideas and the money necessary to make them happen.

I am happy to hear about why I am wrong or stupid or some combination of both, so please leave any comments you may have.
