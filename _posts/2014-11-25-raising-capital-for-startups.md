# Raise Money

[How to Fund a Startup](http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg), 2005.  As usual, Paul Graham's essays are a good jumping off point. This one provides an overview of the startup funding process. 

[Fundraising Mistakes Founders Make](http://blog.samaltman.com/fundraising-mistakes-founder-make). [*Sam Altman*](https://twitter.com/sama), 2014. Talk to investors  *in parallel, not in series*, to setup a competitive environment. Explain the company’s mission, product, current traction, future vision, the market, the competition, your long-term competitive advantage, how you make money, and the team. 

[Fundraising Survival Guide](http://www.paulgraham.com/fundraising.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg),  2008. Practical advice for early stage startups. For example, fit meetings with investors into the spare moments in your development schedule, rather than doing development in the spare moments between meetings with investors. And be ready to "downshift" into consulting if necessary. 

[Hackers Guide to Investors](http://paulgraham.com/guidetoinvestors.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg),  2007. VCs are looking for big hits:  "the way VCs seem to operate is to invest in a bunch of companies, most of which fail, and one of which is Google."

# Bootstrap - Building a Company without Raising Money

Think about how far you can bootstap the company before raising outside money.  The more revenue and traction you can show investors, the sweeter your first term sheet will be. Many startups don't need to raise outside money at all. 

[Bootstrapped, Profitable, & Proud](http://37signals.com/bootstrapped). Basecamp. Series profiles companies that have over one million dollars in revenues, didn’t take VC, and are profitable.

Spanx - Sara Blakely bootstrapped Spanx from a $5,000 investment into a billion dollar business. She owns 100% of the private company, with no debt.

# Finding Investors

## Investor Introductions

[Don’t Ask Your Startup Lawyer for Investor Intros](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2014/02/01/dont-ask-startup-lawyer-investor-intro/). [Jose Ancer](https://twitter.com/ancerj), 2014. "Nothing says 'I can’t hustle' like a paid introduction." 

[Why Most VCs Won’t Intro You to Other VCs (Unless You Follow These Steps)](http://hunterwalk.com/2014/08/11/why-most-vcs-wont-intro-you-to-other-vcs-unless-you-follow-these-steps/). [*Hunter Walk*](https://twitter.com/hunterwalk), 2014. Do your homework before you ask for an intro. Write the draft pitch and intro email for the VC. Follow up. Send periodic updates. 

[Introductions and the "Forward Intro Email"](http://also.roybahat.com/post/92544681186/introductions-and-the-forward-intro-email). [Roy Bahat](https://twitter.com/roybahat), 2014. You write the draft intro email, and "I do only the things I’m best at — knowing the receiver, and sharing my opinion of you." 

[The Double Opt-In Introduction](http://avc.com/2009/11/the-double-optin-introduction/). Fred Wilson, 2009. Asking for permission to make an email intro before making it is good form. I try to do it as a matter of practice. 


## Finding the Right Angels: Accredited Investors

[How to select your angel investors](http://cdixon.org/2009/11/03/how-to-select-your-angel-investors/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. Don't reach for the “celebrity” investors. Celebrity investors might help generate buzz, but a startup is a long trip. Look for investors who will actually roll up their sleeves and help you after the initial buzz dies down.

[What is an accredited investor](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/04/03/what-is-an-accredited-investor/)? [*Yokum Taku*](https://twitter.com/Yokum), 2009. If you can’t raise money from an established seed fund, then raise money from an experienced and  "accredited" angel investor. And if not experienced, at the very least “accredited.” (Accredited = sufficiently rich as defined in the securities laws). 

[Taking Non-Accredited Money – Survival](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2014/10/01/taking-non-accredited-money-startups/). [Jose Ancer](https://twitter.com/ancerj), 2014. Taking non-accredited money is risky, but sometimes it's the only option, especially for startups outside of California and New York.

## How Many Investors? 

[How Many Investors are Too Many](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/02/22/how-many-investors-are-too-many/)? [*Mark Suster*](https://twitter.com/msuster), 2011. “VC’s are like martinis: the first is good, the second one great, and the third is a headache.”


[Party rounds](http://blog.samaltman.com/party-rounds). [*Sam Altman*](https://twitter.com/sama), 2013. The rising popularity of party rounds is bad for companies. In a typical party round, no single investor cares enough about the company.

# Pitching and Investor Presentations

[Pitch yourself, not your idea](http://cdixon.org/2009/11/14/pitch-yourself-not-your-idea/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. Tell the story of someone who has been building stuff her whole life and now just needs some capital to take it to the next level.

[How to Present to Investors](http://paulgraham.com/investors.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg),  2010. Practical advice on giving presentations:  describe a compelling product and get right to the demo; focus on a narrow solution to a widespread problem, don't waste time on business models or secondary matters.  

[How to Pitch Your Startup On Stage](http://justinkan.com/how-to-pitch-your-startup-on-stage). Justin Kan, 2014. How you pitch is important, because investors aren't obligated to expend the mental energy to figure out what you are talking about. Follow this basic flow: market and problem, your solution, evidence that your solution will work (traction, sales, your team’s expertise, etc). 


## NDAs and Ideas vs. Execution 

Don’t ask a serious VC to sign an NDA before you pitch. Instead, pitch your idea only to investors with a reputation for honest dealing. In any event, the value of a startup isn’t in the idea, it's in the *execution* of the idea. 

[Why you shouldn’t keep your startup idea secret](http://cdixon.org/2009/08/22/why-you-shouldnt-keep-your-startup-idea-secret/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. Talk about your idea to almost anyone who will listen: investors, entrepreneurs, friends, people on the street, the bartender, etc.

[The Myth of the Eureka Moment](http://cdixon.org/2009/05/15/the-myth-of-the-eureka-moment/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. "In the 10 years I’ve been involved with startups, I have never seen a “Eureka" moment where someone suddenly comes up with a great idea.  Instead, I have always found idea development to be a wrenching and often meandering process that is guided mostly by instinct.”

[Important Terms for Nondisclosure Agreements](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/04/27/what-is-important-in-a-confidentiality-agreement-or-non-disclosure-agreement-nda/)? [*Yokum Taku*](https://twitter.com/Yokum), 2008. For those times when you *actually* need an NDA, specifically define what information must be confidential, and who must keep it confidential (i.e., mutual or one-way obligation).  Is the obligation not to *disclose* information, or not to *use* the information, or both? 


# How Much to Raise and at What Valuation?

[What’s the right amount of seed money to raise?](http://cdixon.org/2009/12/28/whats-the-right-amount-of-seed-money-to-raise/) [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. Raise "enough to get your startup to an accretive milestone plus some fudge factor. ‘Accretive milestone’ is a fancy way of saying getting your company to a point at which you can raise money at a higher valuation."

[Why Startups Should Raise Money at the Top End of Normal](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/06/05/why-startups-should-raise-money-at-the-top-end-of-normal/). [*Mark Suster*](https://twitter.com/msuster), 2011. Reach for a strong valuation, but reach too far and you might can get burned by the dreaded down round. "Most investors won’t want to go through the brain damage of doing a ‘down round,’ which creates tension between them and early investors.


[The Equity Equation](http://paulgraham.com/equity.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg),  2007. When trading stock in your company for anything (money, an employee, etc.) the test for whether to do it is always the same. You should give up n% of your company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome enough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the whole company was before.
