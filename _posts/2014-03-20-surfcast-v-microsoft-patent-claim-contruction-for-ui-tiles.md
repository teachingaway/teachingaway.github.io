The "tile" interface in Windows 8 was so <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/30/5362156/windows-8-1-update-1-boot-to-desktop-by-default" target="_blank">poorly received</a> that Microsoft is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/windows-8-1-update-1-more-interface-concessions-that-still-wont-make-people-happy/" target="_blank">backpedaling</a> away from it. But intellectual property for user interface ("UI") elements is so important that Microsoft is continuing to defend a patent lawsuit over its unpopular UI. The lawsuit is <em>Surfcast v. Microsoft</em> in the District of Maine. <a href="http://www.surfcast.com/" target="_blank">Surfcast</a>, as Ars Technica <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/10/patent-troll-claims-it-invented-the-windows-8-and-windows-phone-tiles/" target="_blank">notes</a>, is an entity that owns a few patents and its sole business appears to be asserting these patents against Microsoft. Last week (March 2014), Microsoft suffered a setback when Judge Woodcock issued a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2655377192649191314" target="_blank">claim-construction order</a> that went mostly in Surfcast's favor.

This case is interesting because "tiles" are the UI metaphor at the heart of Windows Phone OS, and to a degree, Windows 8. To protect its investment in UI design, Microsoft has been filing hundreds of design and utility patents on its tile and related aspects of its UI. Here's an example of a Microsoft patent that came up in the Surfcast case:

Surfcast, of course, claims to be the true inventor of UI tiles. Here's an image from Surfcast's patent, originally filed in 2000:

&nbsp;

Judge Woodcock is presiding over the case, and he seems to understand the importance of UI design as part of the big picture:

<blockquote>one of skill in the art would read the patent not only for the trees but also for the forest... This invention is, at its heart, a human interface concept that is meant to replace the icon-based paradigm with a tile-based paradigm.</blockquote>

Where are we in the case? In a patent lawsuit, claims are defined (as a matter of law) in a separate claim construction hearing called a "<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5582995013670943601" target="_blank">Markman</a> Hearing." The March 2014 decision in this case was a claim constructing order.

At a claim construction hearing, the defendant can choose from two strategies. First, it can argue for very broad definitions of the claim terms. If the claims are broadly defined, its easier to invalidate them with prior art. But there's also a danger. If the judge grants the broad definition, but the defendant can't invalidate the patent with prior art, the defendant will almost certainly be found infringing on the broadly defined (and valid) claim.

The plaintiff, on the other hand, needs to walk the Markman tightrope. It needs a claim construction that is broad enough to catch the defendant, but narrow enough to avoid all the prior art.

In this <em>Surfcast</em> case, Microsoft argued for a broad definition of the claim terms. If the judge agreed with the broad definition, I'm sure Microsoft had rock-solid prior art lined up to invalidate Surfcast's patent.  However, Judge Woodcock disagreed with Microsoft's proposed definition of "tiles", finding it overly broad.

<blockquote>the Court does not accept Microsoft’s proposed construction: “An area of a display which presents content from an information source.” This is a much broader definition of “tile” than appears in the patent. The whole point of a “tile” in the invention is to combine features of “windows” and “icons” in a way that balances the advantages of each while discarding some features not desirable in the new “tile” interface paradigm.</blockquote>

After a detailed and well-organized claim construction analysis, Judge Woodcock essentially adopts Surfcast's narrower definition of "tiles",

<blockquote>the Court concludes that within the ‘403 Patent, a “tile” is “a graphical representation of an associated information source capable of displaying refreshed content, the graphical representation being persistent and selectable to provide access to underlying information of the associated information source.”</blockquote>

Surfcast's '403 patent doesn't seem to be as weak as the usual patent troll fare, and this claim construction ruling certainly doesn't hurt its case. In the year 2000, I don't really know what the state of the art was for UI design, or whether "tiles" were already known. Was it obvious back then? Maybe it was an innovation?

What does this mean for Microsoft? Probably not much. I assume the narrower definition saves Surfcast from invalidity at the hands of Microsoft's prior art references. Microsoft might appeal up to the Federal Circuit, where the claims will be construed again <em>de novo</em> (a standard of review recently confirmed in <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/12-1014.Opinion.2-18-2014.1.PDF" target="_blank"><em>Lighting Ballast v. Philips</em></a>).

All we can really say at this point is that technology companies are starting to understand the business value of good UI design, and the need to protect UI intellectual property.
