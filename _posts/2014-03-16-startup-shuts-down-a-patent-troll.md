<em>Lumen View v. FindTheBest.com</em> is not the usual troll vs. startup story. Instead of paying to settle, FindTheBest hired a <a href="http://www.leventhallaw.com/about-joe-leventhal/">litigator</a> and launched a public, aggressive and ultimately successful defense. On Friday November 22, 2013, the Honorable Denise Cote invalidated Lumen View's patent, and threw out Lumen View's case. There are a few lessons here for startups who receive similar demand letters.

<h3>The Parties</h3>

FindThebest (FTB) is a startup that helps shoppers compare things in categories like <a href="http://whiskey.findthebest.com/">whiskey</a> and <a href="http://law-school.findthebest.com/">law schools</a>. Lumen View (LV) "is a company that owns patents and licenses them to other users for fees." While it can be difficult to distinguish a “patent troll” from a  “non-practicing entity”, I think we can safely call LV a troll because a judge has invalidated its patent and described its legal arguments as “meritless.”

<h3>The Demand</h3>

In May of 2013, LV sent a <a href="http://adlervermillion.com/PDF/2013-LumenView-v-FindTheBest-PatentLitigation/2013.05.30-LVsDemandLetter.pdf">demand letter</a> accusing FTB of infringing LV’s patent on a type of “bilateral decision-making.” LV demanded a $50,000 payout.

The demand letter was standard fare, including threatening boilerplate like: "Plaintiff is prepared for full-scale litigation to enforce its rights," and "You must act immediately to preserve potentially relevant electronic evidence" or else "we will not hesitate to seek sanctions." etc.

<h3>The Case</h3>

When FindtheBest refused to pay the $50,000, LV followed through on its threatened lawsuit. The parties ended up in front of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denise_Cote">Hon. Denise Cote</a> in the Southern District of New York (Manhattan Federal Court).

In this case, LV asserted a <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US8069073">single patent</a>, with a single independent claim. This is a red flag for a weak case. Patent lawsuits tend to involve at least a handful patents, and several independent claims. An infringement case asserting a single independent claim is dangling from a weak thread.

<h3>LV's Attempted Gag Order</h3>

FindTheBest <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/07/26/how-to-slaughter-a-patent-troll-in-5-steps/">blogged</a> the case. Lumen View wasn't happy about the publicity, so it <a href="http://adlervermillion.com/PDF/2013-LumenView-v-FindTheBest-PatentLitigation/2013.10.22-LVsMotionForGagOrder.pdf">asked</a> the court for a gag-order prohibiting FTB from any further blogging. LV’s theory was that FTB’s blogging violated <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_408">Federal Rule of Evidence 408</a>. This is nonsense. As Judge Cote <a href="http://adlervermillion.com/PDF/2013-LumenView-v-FindTheBest-PatentLitigation/2013.11.12-ORDER-DenyingLVsMotionforGagOrder.pdf">points out</a>,

<blockquote>The plaintiff first explains that its motion is predicated on Federal Rule of Evidence 408, which restricts the admission of settlement negotiations into evidence. That argument is meritless. Rule 408 is a rule of evidence. It is inapposite where, as here, the question is not whether material will be admitted into evidence in court but whether a party may discuss certain matters in public... Moreover, a gag order implicates serious constitutional issues. Without opining as to what circumstances might justify such an order, it is enough to note that they are not present here.</blockquote>

[hat tip to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/patent-trolls-request-for-no-media-gag-order-its-not-happening/">Joe Mullin</a> for picking out these highlights ]

So Lumen View lost its long-shot motion for a gag order. FindTheBest is free to continue blogging the case.

<h3>Judgment on the Pleadings</h3>

FindTheBest had made its own long-shot motion. It <a href="http://adlervermillion.com/PDF/2013-LumenView-v-FindTheBest-PatentLitigation/2013.09.24-FTBsMotionForJudgmentOnThePleadings.pdf">asked</a> the court to invalidate Lumen View's patent on what's called a "motion for judgment on the pleadings." (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_12#rule_12_c">FRCP 12(c)</a>). FTB's motion argued that the LV patent is invalid because it was not really an invention, but merely an "abstract idea." FTB made a strong case in its first 2 paragraphs:
<blockquote>U.S. Patent No. 8,069,073 does not claim patent-eligible subject matter. It is invalid, therefore, under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/101">35 U.S.C. §101</a>. Several recent cases confirm that covering an abstract idea in a veneer of computer implementation does not render the idea patentable.

The '073 Patent claims only the abstract idea of "multilateral analyses" of "preference data" and computing a "closeness of fit value" based on those analyses. Put differently, the '073 Patent claims retrieving a stored list of preferences provided by one party, retrieving a similar stored list of preferences from another party, comparing the lists to determine how closely the preferences of the first party match the preferences of the second party, and generating a list to the parties. Marriage matchmakers have been performing this function for centuries without the aid of computers. [lightly edited].</blockquote>
A 12(c) motion is a procedural longshot, but FindTheBest made a <a href="http://adlervermillion.com/PDF/2013-LumenView-v-FindTheBest-PatentLitigation/2013.09.24-FTBsMotionForJudgmentOnThePleadings.pdf">strong case</a> and Lumen View came back with a <a href="http://adlervermillion.com/PDF/2013-LumenView-v-FindTheBest-PatentLitigation/2013.10.11-LVsOppositionToMotionOnThePleadings.pdf">weak reply</a>. For example, LV failed to appreciate the difference between a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_12#rule_12_b_6">12(b)(6)</a> argument (that the pleadings lack sufficient detail to start a lawsuit) and a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_12#rule_12_c">12(c)</a> argument (that the pleadings are not only sufficient to start a lawsuit, they're enough to finish it). FTB had asked the court to invalidate LV's patent based on the pleadings alone (12(c)), but in reply, LV argued that its pleadings were sufficient to state a claim (12(b)(6)). In her <a href="http://adlervermillion.com/PDF/2013-LumenView-v-FindTheBest-PatentLitigation/2013.11.22-ORDER-InvalidatingLVsPatent.pdf">decision</a>, Judge Cote picked this up right away:
<blockquote>First, Lumen View argues that the only relevant inquiry is whether it complied with the “Form 18” -- an illustrative pleading form for patent cases in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. [LV thinks it should win because it picked the right form and filled in all the blanks.] ...

Lumen View confuses the fact that compliance with Form 18 may immunize a complaint from an attack on the sufficiency of the details pled with the notion that compliance with Form 18 prevents a legally meritless claim from being dismissed on the pleadings. ... Compliance with a pleading form cannot prove that a claim is legally meritorious.</blockquote>

After leading with its weakest argument, Lumen View followed with a stronger theory. LV argued that patents are presumed valid, and that FindTheBest needs to present “clear and convincing” evidence to invalidate LV's patent. This “clear and convincing” standard is why patents are rarely invalided at the early stages of litigation. Judge Cote <a href="http://www.adlervermillion.com/PDF/2013-LumenView-v-FindTheBest-PatentLitigation/2013.11.22-ORDER-InvalidatingLVsPatent.pdf">continues</a>,

<blockquote>It is true that it will be rare that a patent infringement suit can be dismissed at the pleading stage for lack of patentable subject matter because every issued patent is presumed to have been issued properly, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. But rare does not mean never....  It is evident by clear and convincing evidence that the patent is invalid.</blockquote>

FindTheBest made its case convincing by packaging complicated patent issue in simple metaphor. According to FTB, the patent was simply "matchmaking." It was a patent on something "Marriage matchmakers have been performing... for centuries." Judge Cote <a href="http://www.adlervermillion.com/PDF/2013-LumenView-v-FindTheBest-PatentLitigation/2013.11.22-ORDER-InvalidatingLVsPatent.pdf">agreed</a>,

<blockquote>Having two or more parties input preference data is not inventive. Matchmakers have been doing this for millennia. Nor is an unspecified closeness of fit process an inventive idea. It is merely a mathematical manifestation of the underlying process behind matchmaking: determining good matches.</blockquote>

Lumen View’s papers were more disjointed. There was no strong frame or an overarching theme, and the argument was peppered with awkward types like "FTB’s mere arguments about humanity do not present a scintilla of evidence necessary to invalidate any patent."

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

And so, on Friday, a tech startup trounced a patent troll, invalidating its patent only 6 months after the case was filed. Judge Cote concludes,
<blockquote>Claim 1 of the ‘073 patent claims an abstract idea, which is patent ineligible subject matter under Section 101 of the codified Patent Act.  The dependent claims are invalid as well. FindTheBest’s September 24, 2013 motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted.  The Clerk of Court shall enter judgment for the defendant and close the case.</blockquote>

<h3>Legal Costs</h3>

FTB spent about <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/findthebest-destroys-matchmaking-patent-pushes-rico-case-against-troll/">$200,000</a> in legal fees over 6 months. This is 4x more than LV's settlement demand, but FindTheBest won, and won publicly. Future patent trolls may think twice before knocking on their door.

FTB also has an opportunity to recover its attorneys’ fees. FTB can essentially ask Judge Cote to order LV to compensate FTB for the $200,000 FTB had to pay its lawyers. Given the language of her decisions, she seems inclined to grant it.

<h3>Takeaway for Startups</h3>

Its important for tech startups to differentiate amateur patent trolls from the pros, and to plan their legal strategy accordingly. For example, a demand letter citing a single patent with a single independent claim suggests a weak legal case. Its the mark of an amateur troll.

A patent troll filing in the Southern District of New York is another good sign (for the defendant). Pro trolls gravitate towards the Eastern District of Texas where courts are fast and favor plaintiffs.

Finally, if you receive a <a href="http://adlervermillion.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/patent-troll-demand-letter.jpg">demand letter</a> that is only 2 sentences long, set in weird italics, and signed by a non-lawyer, you may be dealing with an amateur patent troll.

When an amateur patent troll asserts a weak patent, it may make more sense for a startup to defend itself than to pay out a quick settlement.
