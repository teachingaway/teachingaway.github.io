DRAFT POST

<p class="big-text">This technology law <a href="/tags/#link+list">Link List</a> collects guidance on employment issues at technology startups.</p> 








# Employment Contracts


# Compensation 

Know the difference between "stock options" and "restricted stock." 


## Stock Options

Stock options are a contract that gives you the right to buy shares in the future at a pre-determined price. Ideally, you get the right to buy shares at today's price (say, $1) at a future date when everyone else is paying a much higher price (say, $100).

## Restricted Stock

Restricted stock is normal "common stock," but the company will have certain rights to buy the stock back from you in certain circumstances. 


## Vesting

A "vesting schedule" incentivizes employees to stick with their employer, by gradually sweetening the equity incentives over time.

## 83(b) Tax Election 

Consider filing an 83(b) Election when you *exercise* stock options and receive *unvested* stock (that is, the stock you receive is still subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture").

Paul Graham [comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3639285), "This sort of scenario is unfortunately very common. The antidote is never to allow acquisition talks to be the main thing you're focusing on. We advise startups who get approached by acquirers to treat it as a background process, and not to take things seriously until the very last stage. If acquisition discussions are just a side show, you can easily terminate them if anything goes wrong. Which, interestingly, probably decreases the chances of things going wrong. M&A guys can smell it when you really want a deal, and that makes them want it less."
