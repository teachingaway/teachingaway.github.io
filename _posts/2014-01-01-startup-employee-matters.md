DRAFT POST

<p class="big-text">This technology law <a href="/tags/#link+list">Link List</a> collects guidance on employment issues at technology startups.</p> 








# Employment Contracts


# Compensation 

Know the difference between "stock options" and "restricted stock." A stock option is the right to buy stock in the future at a pre-determined price. Restricted stock is almost like the reverse. The employee receives the stock today, but the startup has the right to buy the stock back from the employee under certain circumstances. 

In order to negotiate your compensation, you need to know the the startup's "Fully Diluted Capital."

"The only thing that matters in terms of your equity when you join a startup is what percent of the company they are giving you.  If management tells you the number of shares and not the total shares outstanding so you can’t compute the percent you own – **don’t join the company!**"

[*Mary Russell*](https://twitter.com/StockOptionCnsl), 2014. This post includes a good tax comparison of restricted stock, non-qualified stock options (early exercised), incentive stock options, restricted stock units, and non-qualified stock options (not early exercised). 



## Stock Options

Stock options are a contract that gives you the right to buy shares in the future at a pre-determined price. Ideally, you get the right to buy shares at today's price (say, $1) at a future date when everyone else is paying a much higher price (say, $100).

[Employee Equity: How Much](http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-how-much/)? [*Fred Wilson*](https://twitter.com/fredwilson), 2011. For the first 3-5 hires, equity grants are more art than science. After that, when the business is starting to scale up, Fred offers some formulas to help set the size of employee equity grants. 

## Restricted Stock

Restricted stock is normal "common stock," but the company will have certain rights to buy the stock back from you in certain circumstances. 


## Vesting

A "vesting schedule" incentivizes employees to stick with their employer, by gradually sweetening the equity incentives over time.  

The most common vesting scenario is "4 years with a 1-year cliff." This means that 1/4 of your equity will vest after your first full year with the employer, and after that, it 1/12 will vest after each additional 3 month period you stay with the employer. Note: you don't need to agree to just a vesting schedule just because it's commonly used. Faster or slower may be appropriate, depending on the circumstances. 

[Vesting is a Hack](http://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2012/04/vesting-is-a-hack/) - [*Dan Shapiro*](https://twitter.com/danshapiro), 2012. "stock grants are, at their heart, a crude hack to avoid taxes.  Vesting is a hack to the hack – and one almost every founder needs."

## Can the Startup Repurchase Vested Stock? 

Some stock option grants will give the company the right to repurchase an employees fully vested stock at "fair market value." Of course, the company will pick a "fair market value" that may not seem fair to the employee. 

YCombinator's Sam Altman called this arrangement ["horrible" for employees](http://blog.samaltman.com/employee-equity). Angellist's Babak Nivi suggests that employees should "[run screaming from the right to purchase vested stock](http://venturehacks.com/articles/vesting-microhacks)."

Provides an example of how a startup's "fair market value" repurchase right could mean the difference between a $60k payday or a $1.6MM payout at an IPO.

## Tax Issues 

[Incentive Stock Options vs. Nonqualified Stock Options](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2013/05/15/incentive-stock-options-vs-nonqualified-stock-options/).  [*Joe Wallin*](https://twitter.com/joewallin), 2013. Incentive Stock Options ("ISO") offer some tax advantage, but substantially increase complexity. Under many conditions, the Alternative Minimum Tax will eat away at the ISO's benefits anyway. Nonqualified Stock Options ("NQO") are less complicated, and often preferable to ISOs. Joe has previously written about this issue [here](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2010/08/11/top-reasons-nqos-over-isos/). 


## 83(b) Tax Election 

Consider filing an 83(b) Election when you *exercise* stock options and receive *unvested* stock (that is, the stock you receive is still subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture"). 

[83(b) Elections](http://www.startuplawblog.com/section-83b/). [*Joe Wallin*](https://twitter.com/joewallin), 2012. 

[What is an 83(b) election?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/02/15/what-is-an-83b-election/) [*Yokum Taku*](https://twitter.com/Yokum), 2007. When you receive shares subject to vesting, an 83(b) election lets you pay tax on the shares immediately, when the tax burden is smallest. 

## Early Employees

Acceleration, Double-Trigger Acceleration. 
- "Acceleration" refers to skipping or shortening the vesting period. Generally, "acceleration" refers to automatic vesting upon a merger or acquisition of the company. 
- "Double-Trigger Acceleration" refers to automatic vesting upon both (i) a merger and (ii) the new company firing the employee.

Paul Graham [comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3639285), "This sort of scenario is unfortunately very common. The antidote is never to allow acquisition talks to be the main thing you're focusing on. We advise startups who get approached by acquirers to treat it as a background process, and not to take things seriously until the very last stage. If acquisition discussions are just a side show, you can easily terminate them if anything goes wrong. Which, interestingly, probably decreases the chances of things going wrong. M&A guys can smell it when you really want a deal, and that makes them want it less."
