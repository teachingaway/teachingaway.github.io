# Compensation 

Know the difference between "stock options" and "restricted stock." A stock option is the right to buy stock in the future at a pre-determined price. Restricted stock is almost the reverse. The employee receives the stock today, but the startup has the right to buy the stock back from the employee under certain circumstances. Restricted stock tends to be the better tax arrangement for the employee, especially for a pre-series A company.  

To negotiate your compensation, you need to know the number of shares outstanding based on the startup's "fully diluted capital." This needs to include the common stock, preferred stock, options outstanding, unissued shares remaining in the options pool, warrants and convertible notes. 

[The one number you should know about your equity grant](http://cdixon.org/2009/08/28/the-one-number-you-should-know-about-your-equity-grant/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. "The only thing that matters in terms of your equity when you join a startup is what percent of the company they are giving you.  If management tells you the number of shares and not the total shares outstanding so you can’t compute the percent you own – *don’t join the company!*"

## Stock Options - Startup's Perspective 

[The Right Way to Grant Equity to Your Employees](http://firstround.com/article/The-Right-Way-to-Grant-Equity-to-Your-Employees). 

[Employee Equity: How Much](http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-how-much/)? [*Fred Wilson*](https://twitter.com/fredwilson), 2011. For the first 3-5 hires, equity grants are more art than science. After that, when the business is starting to scale up, Fred offers some formulas to help set the size of employee equity grants. 


## Stock Options - Employee's Perspective

Stock options are a contract that gives you the right to buy shares in the future at a pre-determined price. Ideally, you get the right to buy shares at today's price (say, $1) at a future date when everyone else is paying a much higher price (say, $100). 

[An Engineer’s guide to Stock Options](http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/an-engineers-guide-to-stock-options). [*Alex Maccaw*](https://twitter.com/maccaw), 2013. 

[An alternative to employee options/equity grants](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2987-an-alternative-to-employee-optionsequity-grants). [*Jason Fried*](https://twitter.com/jasonfried), 2011. 

[The 14 Crucial Questions About Stock Options](https://blog.wealthfront.com/stock-options-14-crucial-questions/). Andy Rachleff, Wealthfront, 2014. A nice overview of issues to consider before negotiating an equity incentive package. 

[First Employee of a Startup? You're Probably Getting Screwed](http://blog.itlater.com/first-employee-of-startup-you-are-probably-getting-screwed/)! Boris Dinkevich (2011). Boris lays down some simple math to help early employees compare their employee equity deal to the VC's investment equity deal. 

## Restricted Stock

In a restricted stock grant, the employee owns normal "common stock," but the company has the right to buy the stock back in certain circumstances. 


# Vesting

A "vesting schedule" incentivizes employees to stick with their employer, by gradually sweetening the equity incentives over time.  

The most common vesting scenario is "4 years with a 1-year cliff." This means that 1/4 of your equity will vest after your first full year with the employer, and after that, it 1/12 will vest after each additional 3 month period you stay with the employer. Note: you don't need to agree to just a vesting schedule just because it's commonly used. Faster or slower may be appropriate, depending on the circumstances. 

[Vesting is a Hack](http://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2012/04/vesting-is-a-hack/) - [*Dan Shapiro*](https://twitter.com/danshapiro), 2012. "stock grants are, at their heart, a crude hack to avoid taxes.  Vesting is a hack to the hack – and one almost every founder needs."

[Employee Equity](http://blog.samaltman.com/employee-equity).  [*Sam Altman*](https://twitter.com/sama), 2014.

## Can the Startup Repurchase Vested Stock? 

Some stock option grants will give the company the right to repurchase an employees fully vested stock at "fair market value." Of course, the company will pick a "fair market value" that may not seem fair to the employee. 

YCombinator's Sam Altman called this arrangement ["horrible" for employees](http://blog.samaltman.com/employee-equity). Angellist's Babak Nivi suggests that employees should "[run screaming from the right to purchase vested stock](http://venturehacks.com/articles/vesting-microhacks)."

[Can the Company Take Back my Vested Shares](http://stockoptioncounsel.com/blog/standards-ownership-canthecomanytakebackmyvestedshares)? [*Mary Russell*](https://twitter.com/StockOptionCnsl), 2014. Provides an example of how a startup's "fair market value" repurchase right could mean the difference between a $60k payday or a $1.6MM payout at an IPO.  


[Supersize Your Vesting with these Microhacks](http://venturehacks.com/articles/vesting-microhacks). [*Babak Nivi*](https://twitter.com/nivi), 2007. 

## Accelerating the Vesting Schedule

Founders and early employees may be able to negotiate for an "acceleration"  clause - a clause that shortens the vesting period under certain conditions.

-  "Acceleration" generally refers to automatic vesting upon a merger or acquisition of the company. This is favorable to the employee, but the acquiring company will not be happy if all of the key employees vanish soon after the acquisition. 
- "Double-Trigger Acceleration" refers to automatic vesting upon both (i) a merger and (ii) the new company firing the employee. This should be less objectionable to startups and acquiring companies because it still incentives employees to stay with the new company after a merger. 



## Tax Issues 

[Incentive Stock Options vs. Nonqualified Stock Options](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2013/05/15/incentive-stock-options-vs-nonqualified-stock-options/).  [*Joe Wallin*](https://twitter.com/joewallin), 2013. Incentive Stock Options ("ISO") offer some tax advantage, but substantially increase complexity. Under many conditions, the Alternative Minimum Tax will eat away at the ISO's benefits anyway. Nonqualified Stock Options ("NQO") are less complicated, and often preferable to ISOs. Joe has previously written about this issue [here](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2010/08/11/top-reasons-nqos-over-isos/). 

[Tips on Negotiating Equity Incentives when Joining an Early Stage Startup](http://stockoptioncounsel.com/blog/joining-an-early-stage-startup-negotiateyour-equity-wisely-with-stock-option-counsel-tips/2014/2/12). [*Mary Russell*](https://twitter.com/StockOptionCnsl), 2014. This post includes a good tax comparison of (a) restricted stock, (b) non-qualified stock options (early exercised), (c) incentive stock options, (d) restricted stock units, and  (e) non-qualified stock options (not early exercised). 


## 83(b) Tax Election 

Consider filing an 83(b) election when you receive stock subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture" (a specially defined tax phrase). This may include, for example: (i) receiving stock subject to vesting, (ii) *exercising* stock options and receive *unvested* stock (that is, the stock you receive is still subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture"). 

[83(b) Elections](http://www.startuplawblog.com/section-83b/). [*Joe Wallin*](https://twitter.com/joewallin), 2012. 

[What is an 83(b) election?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/02/15/what-is-an-83b-election/) [*Yokum Taku*](https://twitter.com/Yokum), 2007. When you receive shares subject to vesting, an 83(b) election lets you pay tax on the shares immediately, when the tax burden is smallest.

# Hiring Engineers


[The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html). Joel Spolsky, 2006. 

[Hiring a VP Engineering for your Internet Startup](http://cdixon.org/2008/04/17/what-to-look-for-in-hiring-a-vp-engineering-for-your-internet-startup/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2008. 

[Recruiting Programmers to Your Startup](http://cdixon.org/2011/12/29/recruiting-programmers-to-your-startup/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2011. 

[How to Hire](http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-hire).  [*Sam Altman*](https://twitter.com/sama), 2013. Hiring decisions are critical, so don't be afraid to spend time on them. Consider having prospects audition for a job instead of interview for it. That is, hire them for a two-day project as a contractor and see how it goes.

# Employment Contracts

**At Will**. Most employment contracts are for "at will" employment, as opposed to employment for a particular length of time. 

## Non-Compete Agreements

# Firing Employees

Document a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for filing anyone, regardless of whether they are "at will." Talk to your lawyer. Consider making a separation payment to the employee in exchange for signing a release of any and all claims against the company. 



[Firing](http://cdixon.org/2012/06/20/firing/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2012. 

[Startup Mantra: Hire Fast, Fire Fast](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/05/26/startup-mantra-hire-fast-fire-fast/). [*Mark Suster*](https://twitter.com/msuster), 2011. 

[How to Deal with Pure Recruiting Mistakes.](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2013/11/27/how-to-deal-with-pure-recruiting-mistakes/) [*Mark Suster*](https://twitter.com/msuster), 2013. 

[Parting Ways With A Founding Team Member](http://avc.com/2010/06/parting-ways-with-a-founding-team-member/). [*Fred Wilson*](https://twitter.com/fredwilson), 2010.  

[When to fire your co-founders](http://venturehacks.com/articles/fire-co-founders). Venture Hacks, 2010. 

[NY State WARN Act](http://labor.ny.gov/workforcenypartners/warn/warnportal.shtm).  NY companies with 50 or more employees need to provide 90 days notice of any mass layoffs. 

**References**. It can be dangerous to provide a negative reference, even if it's an honest description of the former employee's work. Instead, just confirm the former employee's dates of employment and say "we have a policy of not providing references."
