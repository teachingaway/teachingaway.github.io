<p class="big-text">A couple years ago, at a securities law teaching seminar for artists hosted by a well-known Seattle law firm, an audience member asked the presenting lawyer what he thought about Kickstarter. The securities lawyer had never heard of it, but he added that it sounded pretty sketchy and was probably a bad idea. The statement did not go over well. I heard at least one audible scoff of disbelief from the back of the room.</p>

Fast forward to just a couple weeks ago at a formal “Meet the Securities Regulators” event where a state securities regulator gave a presentation to a group of securities lawyers on the proposed SEC crowdfunding regulations, <a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2013/33-9470.pdf">Regulation Crowdfunding</a>. While the presentation was a decent summary of the proposed rules, its tone was of a not so subtle mockery of the entire crowdfunding concept. The biggest laugh-line came from the presenter’s use of irony quotes in referring to the “wisdom” of the crowd. Get it, the crowd is not wise. The audience loved it.

Maybe the skepticism of traditional securities lawyers toward crowdfunding is just due to fear of the unknown, or the tendency to diminish the importance of things one doesn't understand. But, I think the derision of crowdfunding by serious types also stems from a  deeper generational shift in attitudes about the nature and scope of effective regulation. Where the existing old school approach relies on a paternalistic scheme of full-scale prescriptive regulation, the new internet-raised school looks more to reputational and structural mechanisms to moderate risk to the public.

## Wither old school regulation

The old school regulatory approach is direct and comprehensive oversight--registration, licensing and multiple layers of bureaucracy and hoop jumping. This approach is good at creating high barriers for new market entrants, but has always been a poor way to ensure either honesty or quality. Many of our existing regulatory structures have been built up over long years of mutually-reinforced protectionist attitudes and cooperation between legacy players and regulators. In the worst cases,  regulators lose sight of the actual harms they are chartered to protect the public from and behave as though protecting legacy players from “unfair” competition is part of their mission.

In many cases, regulation seems to be just for the sake of regulation. The long list of industries and professions subject to special types of licensing  is both humorous and sad. (Check out the list just for Washington State <em><a href="http://www.dol.wa.gov/listoflicenses.html">here</a></em>.) However, what you don't see on this list are the newer web- and tech-related professions. There is no “social networking company” or “website developer” specific license. Is it just a matter of time until regulations catch up with these new fields and a website designer will have to be licensed like an <a href="http://www.iida.org/content.cfm/state-licensing-guide">interior designer</a> has to now?

I don’t think that will happen. I am not an <em><a href="http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2009/03/the_third_wave.htm">internet exceptionalist</a></em>, but new technologies change the way that people actually live, which in turn shifts cultural attitudes and expectations and then the finally the law. I don’t think there has been a new technology as transformative as the internet since possibly the automobile.

The internet has changed the way that people engage in business and make commercial decisions. Pre-internet, with limited transparency and available information, strict rules on who can do what and how they have to do it may have been the best way to stop scammers and phonies from ripping off the public. But that time is past. The internet allows us to rely on reputational and structural mechanisms to protect us from the unscrupulous and incompetent. This is not a techno-libertarian fantasy or a call for widespread deregulation, just new thinking about what actually works in reaction to the huge changes that the internet has brought.

The shift in attitudes and regulatory expectations can be seen in the trend of startups offering intermediary platforms for peer-to-peer services and market facilitation. Startups like <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a>, <a href="http://www.rover.com/">Rover</a>, <a href="http://porch.com/">Porch</a>, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, <a href="http://www.lyft.me/">Lyft</a>, and technologies like Bitcoin open the connection between customers and service providers. With increasing frequency, these young companies are picking fights with old school regulators and legacy players. The last thing to change will be the law.

## Crowdfunding is the native internetian response to a capital markets failure

The goal of securities regulation has traditionally been to protect the investing public from being taken in by glint-eyed and fast-talking visionaries peddling investments in underwater oil mining operations in Antarctica. They say you can’t con an honest man. The securities regulators have never met one.

Whether we are witnessing the final death of the modernist era or only a post-postmodernist interruption, there has been a tremendous shift toward local, craft, artisan and other social ventures. Our old ideas about proper securities regulation have created nearly insurmountable barriers to the traditional capital markets for these companies. Non-investment crowdfunding (e.g. Kickstarter) is serving as a tiny spigot for society’s huge desire to have capital flow to interesting ideas and local, small-scale startups. Kickstarter has proved that people are willing to give almost free money to back entrepreneurs and artists they want to see succeed.

<div class="pullquoteright">Investment crowdfunding is peer-to-peer democratization of the small business capital markets. It is time that people are allowed to invest in their own communities.</div>

Unlike the old school approach to protection of the investing public--registration, disclosure, investor wealth conditions, securities legends, etc--, the risk to the public from crowdfunding is limited by its structure, and the ability of people to judge the reputation of both the company and the intermediary (e.g. funding portal).

Crowdfunding, in ideal form, accomplishes this primarily through two mechanisms:

<ul>
	<li>fixed, low limits on the amount people can invest (structural); and</li>
	<li>the requirement that all crowdfunding be done passively and openly through online “intermediaries” (structural and reputational).</li>
</ul>
Unfortunately, the JOBS ACT and the SEC weakened both these structural and reputational mechanisms by:
<ul>
	<li>allowing scaled investment limits based on investor income and net worth;</li>
	<li>limiting the ability of funding portals to screen companies based on any criteria that has to do with the actual merits of the offering; and</li>
	<li>giving registered brokers a distinct advantage in the market over funding portals by way of item (2) above and by limiting the complementary services that a funding portal can provide (e.g. transfer agent, shareholder nominee).</li>
</ul>
Instead of playing to the strengths of online crowdfunding, the drafters of the JOBS ACT and the SEC went crawling back to the old school regulatory tool box: more registration, licensing, audits, financials, annual filings, and those oh-so crucial ALL CAPS warning legends. Even after turning the crowdfunding <em>exemption</em> into a de facto micro-cap IPO <em>registration</em>, "serious" lawyers still scoff at the idea that average people should be trusted to invest small amounts of their own money in small businesses.

Instead, I suppose, people should open e-Trade accounts and trade <a href="http://www.popmodal.com/video/1277/Trading-Places-Final-Exchange-Scene-amp-Explanation">frozen concentrated orange juice futures</a> or whatever Jim Cramer says is a must-buy this week.


## Will crowdfunding work as proposed?

All is not lost, however. I think the SEC left just enough room for investment crowdfunding to work. It will be cumbersome for sure and will require adjustments in some of the attitudes and expectations of both the crowd-funded companies and their service-providers, mainly the lawyers. Lawyers that want to work in the crowdfunding space are going to have to forget what they think they know and learn how to operate lighter, smarter and more flexibly.

Coming up in future posts, I plan on explaining a little more about the importance of service-providers in making crowdfunding work, some of the ugly and less ugly details of proposed Regulation Crowdfunding and ways to make it better.
