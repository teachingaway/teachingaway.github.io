Our technology law [Link List](/tags/#link+list) series collects useful startup guidance from around the internet.[^1]  This post is about raising a very first round of funding for a technology startup - alternatively called a "seed round", "angel round", or "friends and family round." Check out our more general [Raising Capital for Startups ](/raising-capital-for-startups/) post for links applicable to all stages of venture financing. 

[^1]: This is advice worth reading, but it may not be advice that’s right for your startup.

# Incubators and Accelerators

Incubators like [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and [Tech Stars](http://www.techstars.com/program/locations/nyc/) are generally great for startups. However, not all incubators are created equal. 

[The Most Important Question to Ask Before Taking Seed Money (from a VC incubator)](http://cdixon.org/2009/10/30/the-most-important-question-to-ask-before-taking-seed-money/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. If your startup goes through a VC’s incubator, and the VC fund doesn’t invest at the end, it sends a strong negative signal to other VCs. So it's important to ask, "How many companies that the sponsor passed on went on to raise money from other sources?"

[We Got Accepted Into Techstars & Turned Them Down](http://talkroute.com/got-accepted-into-techstars-turned-it-down/). While I generally think Tech Stars and YCombinator are helpful, here's a counterpoint from a startup called TalkRoute. 

[Startup Accelerators: The Legal Terms](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2014/07/01/startup-accelerators-legal-terms/).  [Jose Ancer](https://twitter.com/ancerj), 2014. Depending on the accelerator, the legal terms can sometimes be aggressive and give the accelerator undue influence over your company’s trajectory. 

# Angel Investors / Seed Financing

[Notes on Raising Seed Financing](http://cdixon.org/2011/06/09/notes-on-raising-seed-financing/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2011. A great overview. Ideally, (1)  raise money after you have a product / traction, (2) build momentum... (5) network like crazy, but  "avoid anyone who asks you to pay for intros (even indirectly like committing to a law firm in exchange for intros)."

[Upside Risk](http://blog.samaltman.com/upside-risk). [Sam Altman](https://twitter.com/sama), 2013. Angels make their money from investing in rare companies that deliver 100x returns. The the real risk for angel investors is missing out on that outstanding investment, not failing to get their money back on their non-unicorn companies. "And yet angel investors continue to ask for onerous terms to mitigate their ‘downside risk.’  All this does is piss founders off, misalign incentives, and harm the investors’ chance of getting to invest in the best deals." 


# Finding Investors

## Investor Introductions

[Don’t Ask Your Startup Lawyer for Investor Intros](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2014/02/01/dont-ask-startup-lawyer-investor-intro/). [Jose Ancer](https://twitter.com/ancerj), 2014. "Nothing says 'I can’t hustle' like a paid introduction." 

[Why Most VCs Won’t Intro You to Other VCs (Unless You Follow These Steps)](http://hunterwalk.com/2014/08/11/why-most-vcs-wont-intro-you-to-other-vcs-unless-you-follow-these-steps/). [*Hunter Walk*](https://twitter.com/hunterwalk), 2014. Do your homework before you ask for an intro. Write the draft pitch and intro email for the VC. Follow up. Send periodic updates. 

[Introductions and the "Forward Intro Email"](http://also.roybahat.com/post/92544681186/introductions-and-the-forward-intro-email). [Roy Bahat](https://twitter.com/roybahat), 2014. You write the draft intro email, and "I do only the things I’m best at — knowing the receiver, and sharing my opinion of you." 

[The Double Opt-In Introduction](http://avc.com/2009/11/the-double-optin-introduction/). Fred Wilson, 2009. Asking for permission to make an email intro before making it is good form. I try to do it as a matter of practice. 


## Choosing the Right Angels

[How to Select Your Angel Investors](http://cdixon.org/2009/11/03/how-to-select-your-angel-investors/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. Don't reach for the “celebrity” investors. Celebrity investors might help generate buzz, but its better to have investors who will roll up their sleeves and help out when the buzz dies down.

[What is an Accredited Investor](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/04/03/what-is-an-accredited-investor/)? [*Yokum Taku*](https://twitter.com/Yokum), 2009. If you can’t raise money from an established seed fund, then raise money from an "accredited" angel investor. (Accredited = sufficiently rich as defined in the securities laws). 

[Taking Non-Accredited Money – Survival](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2014/10/01/taking-non-accredited-money-startups/). [Jose Ancer](https://twitter.com/ancerj), 2014. Taking non-accredited money is risky, but sometimes it's the only option, especially for startups outside of California and New York.

## How Many Investors? 

[How Many Investors are Too Many](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/02/22/how-many-investors-are-too-many/)? [*Mark Suster*](https://twitter.com/msuster), 2011. “VC’s are like martinis: the first is good, the second one great, and the third is a headache.”

[Party rounds](http://blog.samaltman.com/party-rounds). [*Sam Altman*](https://twitter.com/sama), 2013. The rising popularity of party rounds is bad for companies. In a typical party round, no single investor cares enough about the company.

# How Much to Raise and at What Valuation?

[What’s the Right Amount of Seed Money to Raise?](http://cdixon.org/2009/12/28/whats-the-right-amount-of-seed-money-to-raise/) [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. Raise "enough to get your startup to an accretive milestone plus some fudge factor. ‘Accretive milestone’ is a fancy way of saying getting your company to a point at which you can raise money at a higher valuation."

[Why Startups Should Raise Money at the Top End of Normal](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/06/05/why-startups-should-raise-money-at-the-top-end-of-normal/). [*Mark Suster*](https://twitter.com/msuster), 2011. Reach for a strong valuation, but reach too far and you might can get burned by the dreaded down round. "Most investors won’t want to go through the brain damage of doing a ‘down round,’ which creates tension between them and early investors.

[Seed Rounds: How to Pick a Valuation](http://josephwalla.com/seed-rounds-how-to-pick-a-valuation). [Joseph Walla](https://twitter.com/josephwalla), 2014. "Valuations have little basis in reality for early stage companies. You evaluate the team, product, market and other variables - then, make a general guess."

[The Equity Equation](http://paulgraham.com/equity.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg),  2007. When trading stock in your company for anything (money, an employee, etc.) the test for whether to do it is always the same. You should give up n% of your company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome enough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the whole company was before.

[Bridges or Seeds? A Primer on Your First Financing](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2012/06/07/bridge-seed-financing-primer/). [Jose Ancer](https://twitter.com/ancerj), 2012. Raising a round between $500k and $1M requires you to carefully balance the benefits of a convertible note versus an equity round. Lots of good guidance in this primer. 



## Signalling Risk 

[The Importance of Investor Signaling in Venture Pricing](http://cdixon.org/2010/03/12/the-importance-of-investor-signaling-in-venture-pricing/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2010.  There are very few hard metrics in venture pricing. As a result, one of the primary valuation inputs is what other investors think about a company.

[The Problem with Taking Seed Money from Big VCs](http://cdixon.org/2009/08/14/the-problem-with-taking-seed-money-from-big-vcs/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. If you take *seed* money from a big VC fund, be aware of the potential signalling risk if the VC fund decides not to invest in your Series A round.  Other potential investors will think “if this top VC that has hundreds of millions of dollars and knows this company the best doesn’t want to invest, why would I?” 

[*Sam Altman*](https://twitter.com/sama) disagrees: "Many little things simply don't matter very much--for example, the '*signal*' sent when an early investor chooses not to participate in a later round. If the company is doing well stuff like this is easily overlooked, and if the company's not doing it will struggle to raise money anyway."

# Standardized Seed Financing Docs


[How do the sample Series Seed financing documents differ from typical Series A financing documents](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2010/03/14/how-do-the-sample-series-seed-financing-documents-differ-from-typical-series-a-financing-documents/)? [*Yokum Taku*](https://twitter.com/Yokum), 2010. A nice matrix comparing the details of the Series Seed, Y Combinator, and TechStars standard documents. 

[Why There Will Never be a Standard Set of Seed Documents](http://www.jasonmendelson.com/archives/2010/03/why-there-will-never-be-a-standard-set-of-seed-documents-a-k-a-why-brad-feld-will-fail.php) [(aka why Brad Feld will Fail)](http://www.jasonmendelson.com/archives/2010/03/why-there-will-never-be-a-standard-set-of-seed-documents-a-k-a-why-brad-feld-will-fail.php), Jason Mendelson, 2010. Perhaps the more important takeaway is that the National Venture Capital Association docs "are too complicated for 90% of the folks out there doing the deals."  

[Don’t be creative about the wrong things](http://cdixon.org/2010/02/16/dont-be-creative-about-the-wrong-things/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2010. "your deal terms should be plain vanilla. These things are time tested and you are far more likely to screw things up than create value by tinkering with them." 



- Here are some of the most popular standard seed documents: 

  - [SAFE Financing Documents](http://www.ycombinator.com/documents/). Y Combinator 2014. 
  - [Series Seed Financing Documents](http://www.seriesseed.com/) - by Fenwick & West (with input from Zeke Vermillion).
  - [TechStars Model Seed Funding Documents](http://www.techstars.org/2009/02/07/techstars-model-seed-funding-documents/) (by Cooley). 
  - [Y Combinator Series AA Equity Financing Documents](http://ycombinator.com/seriesaa.html) (by WSGR). 
  - [Founders Institute Plain Preferred Term Sheet](http://www.founderinstitute.com/posts/69) (by WSGR).
