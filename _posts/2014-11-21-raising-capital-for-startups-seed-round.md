# Raising Money

[How to Fund a Startup](http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg), 2005.  As usual, Paul Graham's essays are a good jumping off point. This one provides an overview of the startup funding process. 

[Fundraising Mistakes Founders Make](http://blog.samaltman.com/fundraising-mistakes-founder-make). [*Sam Altman*](https://twitter.com/sama), 2014. Talk to investors  *in parallel, not in series*, to setup a competitive environment. Explain the company’s mission, product, current traction, future vision, the market, the competition, your long-term competitive advantage, how you make money, and the team. 

[Fundraising Survival Guide](http://www.paulgraham.com/fundraising.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg),  2008. Practical advice for early stage startups. For example, fit meetings with investors into the spare moments in your development schedule, rather than doing development in the spare moments between meetings with investors. And be ready to "downshift" into consulting if necessary. 

[Hackers Guide to Investors](http://paulgraham.com/guidetoinvestors.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg),  2007. VCs are looking for big hits:  "the way VCs seem to operate is to invest in a bunch of companies, most of which fail, and one of which is Google." 

[Was Paul Graham Right in his "High Resolution" Financing Post](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/09/25/revisiting-paul-grahams-high-resolution-financing/)? [*Mark Suster*](https://twitter.com/msuster), 2010.

# Finding Investors

## Investor Introductions

[Don’t Ask Your Startup Lawyer for Investor Intros](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2014/02/01/dont-ask-startup-lawyer-investor-intro/). [Jose Ancer](https://twitter.com/ancerj), 2014. "Nothing says 'I can’t hustle' like a paid introduction." 

[Why Most VCs Won’t Intro You to Other VCs (Unless You Follow These Steps)](http://hunterwalk.com/2014/08/11/why-most-vcs-wont-intro-you-to-other-vcs-unless-you-follow-these-steps/). [*Hunter Walk*](https://twitter.com/hunterwalk), 2014. Do your homework before you ask for an intro. Write the draft pitch and intro email for the VC. Follow up. Send periodic updates. 

[Introductions and the "Forward Intro Email"](http://also.roybahat.com/post/92544681186/introductions-and-the-forward-intro-email). [Roy Bahat](https://twitter.com/roybahat), 2014. You write the draft intro email, and "I do only the things I’m best at — knowing the receiver, and sharing my opinion of you." 

[The Double Opt-In Introduction](http://avc.com/2009/11/the-double-optin-introduction/). Fred Wilson, 2009. Asking for permission to make an email intro before making it is good form. I try to do it as a matter of practice. 


## Choosing the Right Angels

[How to Select Your Angel Investors](http://cdixon.org/2009/11/03/how-to-select-your-angel-investors/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. Don't reach for the “celebrity” investors. Celebrity investors might help generate buzz, but a startup is a long trip. Look for investors who will actually roll up their sleeves and help you after the initial buzz dies down.

[What is an Accredited Investor](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/04/03/what-is-an-accredited-investor/)? [*Yokum Taku*](https://twitter.com/Yokum), 2009. If you can’t raise money from an established seed fund, then raise money from an "accredited" angel investor. (Accredited = sufficiently rich as defined in the securities laws). 

[Taking Non-Accredited Money – Survival](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2014/10/01/taking-non-accredited-money-startups/). [Jose Ancer](https://twitter.com/ancerj), 2014. Taking non-accredited money is risky, but sometimes it's the only option, especially for startups outside of California and New York.

## How Many Investors? 

[How Many Investors are Too Many](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/02/22/how-many-investors-are-too-many/)? [*Mark Suster*](https://twitter.com/msuster), 2011. “VC’s are like martinis: the first is good, the second one great, and the third is a headache.”

[Party rounds](http://blog.samaltman.com/party-rounds). [*Sam Altman*](https://twitter.com/sama), 2013. The rising popularity of party rounds is bad for companies. In a typical party round, no single investor cares enough about the company.

# Pitching and Investor Presentations

[Pitch Yourself, Not Your Idea](http://cdixon.org/2009/11/14/pitch-yourself-not-your-idea/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. Tell the story of someone who has been building stuff her whole life and now just needs some capital to take it to the next level.

[How to Present to Investors](http://paulgraham.com/investors.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg),  2010. Practical advice on giving presentations:  describe a compelling product and get right to the demo; focus on a narrow solution to a widespread problem, don't waste time on business models or secondary matters.  

[How to Pitch Your Startup On Stage](http://justinkan.com/how-to-pitch-your-startup-on-stage). Justin Kan, 2014. How you pitch is important, because investors aren't obligated to expend the mental energy to figure out what you are talking about. Follow this basic flow: market and problem, your solution, evidence that your solution will work (traction, sales, your team’s expertise, etc). 

# NDAs and Ideas vs. Execution 

Don’t ask a serious VC to sign an NDA before you pitch. Instead, pitch your idea only to investors with a reputation for honest dealing. The value of a startup isn’t in the idea, it's in the *execution* of the idea. 

[Why You Shouldn’t Keep Your Startup Idea Secret](http://cdixon.org/2009/08/22/why-you-shouldnt-keep-your-startup-idea-secret/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. Talk about your idea to almost anyone who will listen: investors, entrepreneurs, friends, people on the street, the bartender, etc.

[The Myth of the Eureka Moment](http://cdixon.org/2009/05/15/the-myth-of-the-eureka-moment/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. "In the 10 years I’ve been involved with startups, I have never seen a “Eureka" moment where someone suddenly comes up with a great idea.  Instead, I have always found idea development to be a wrenching and often meandering process that is guided mostly by instinct.”

[Important Terms for Nondisclosure Agreements](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/04/27/what-is-important-in-a-confidentiality-agreement-or-non-disclosure-agreement-nda/)? [*Yokum Taku*](https://twitter.com/Yokum), 2008. For those times when you *actually* need an NDA, specifically define what information must be confidential, and who must keep it confidential (i.e., mutual or one-way obligation).  Is the obligation not to *disclose* information, or not to *use* the information, or both? 






# How Much to Raise and at What Valuation?

[What’s the Right Amount of Seed Money to Raise?](http://cdixon.org/2009/12/28/whats-the-right-amount-of-seed-money-to-raise/) [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. Raise "enough to get your startup to an accretive milestone plus some fudge factor. ‘Accretive milestone’ is a fancy way of saying getting your company to a point at which you can raise money at a higher valuation."

[Why Startups Should Raise Money at the Top End of Normal](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/06/05/why-startups-should-raise-money-at-the-top-end-of-normal/). [*Mark Suster*](https://twitter.com/msuster), 2011. Reach for a strong valuation, but reach too far and you might can get burned by the dreaded down round. "Most investors won’t want to go through the brain damage of doing a ‘down round,’ which creates tension between them and early investors.

[Seed Rounds: How to Pick a Valuation](http://josephwalla.com/seed-rounds-how-to-pick-a-valuation). Joseph Walla, 2014. "Valuations have little basis in reality for early stage companies. You evaluate the team, product, market and other variables - then, make a general guess."

[The Equity Equation](http://paulgraham.com/equity.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg),  2007. When trading stock in your company for anything (money, an employee, etc.) the test for whether to do it is always the same. You should give up n% of your company if what you trade it for improves your average outcome enough that the (100 - n)% you have left is worth more than the whole company was before.


# Signalling Risk 

[The Importance of Investor Signaling in Venture Pricing](http://cdixon.org/2010/03/12/the-importance-of-investor-signaling-in-venture-pricing/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2010.  There are very few hard metrics in venture pricing. As a result, one of the primary valuation inputs is what other investors think about a company.

[The Problem with Taking Seem Money from Big VCs](http://cdixon.org/2009/08/14/the-problem-with-taking-seed-money-from-big-vcs/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. If you take *seed* money from a big VC fund, be aware of the potential signalling risk if the VC fund decides not to invest in your Series A round.  Other potential investors will think “if this top VC that has hundreds of millions of dollars and knows this company the best doesn’t want to invest, why would I?” 

[*Sam Altman*](https://twitter.com/sama) disagrees: "Many little things simply don't matter very much--for example, the '*signal*' sent when an early investor chooses not to participate in a later round. If the company is doing well stuff like this is easily overlooked, and if the company's not doing it will struggle to raise money anyway." [Fundraising Mistakes Founders Make](http://blog.samaltman.com/fundraising-mistakes-founder-make), 2014.


# Angel Investors / Seed Financing

[Notes on Raising Seed Financing](http://cdixon.org/2011/06/09/notes-on-raising-seed-financing/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2011. A great overview. Ideally, (1)  raise money after you have a product / traction, (2) build momentum... (5) network like crazy, but  "avoid anyone who asks you to pay for intros (even indirectly like committing to a law firm in exchange for intros)."

[Upside Risk](http://blog.samaltman.com/upside-risk). [Sam Altman](https://twitter.com/sama), 2013. Angels make their money from investing in rare companies that deliver 100x returns. The the real risk for angel investors is missing out on that outstanding investment, not failing to get their money back on their non-unicorn companies. "And yet angel investors continue to ask for onerous terms to mitigate their ‘downside risk.’  All this does is piss founders off, misalign incentives, and harm the investors’ chance of getting to invest in the best deals." 

[Bridges or Seeds? A Primer on Your First Financing](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2012/06/07/bridge-seed-financing-primer/). [Jose Ancer](https://twitter.com/ancerj), 2012. Raising a round between $500k and $1M requires you to carefully balance the benefits of a convertible note versus an equity round. Lots of good guidance in this primer. 

[Thoughts on Raising Angel Money](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/07/19/raising-angel-money/). [*Mark Suster*](https://twitter.com/msuster), 2009. Entrepreneurs should raise money from the most experienced people possible. 


# Incubators, Accelerators, etc. 

Incubators like [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and [Tech Stars](http://www.techstars.com/program/locations/nyc/) are generally great for startups. However, not all incubators are created equal. 

[The Most Important Question to Ask Before Taking Seed Money (from a VC incubator)](http://cdixon.org/2009/10/30/the-most-important-question-to-ask-before-taking-seed-money/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. If your startup goes through a VC’s incubator, and the VC fund doesn’t invest at the end, it sends a strong negative signal to other VCs. So it's important to ask, "How many companies that the sponsor passed on went on to raise money from other sources?"

[We Got Accepted Into Techstars & Turned Them Down](http://talkroute.com/got-accepted-into-techstars-turned-it-down/). While I generally think Tech Stars and YCombinator are helpful, here's a counterpoint from a startup called TalkRoute.

# Standardized Seed Financing Docs

## Commentary on Standardized Seed Docs 

[How do the sample Series Seed financing documents differ from typical Series A financing documents](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2010/03/14/how-do-the-sample-series-seed-financing-documents-differ-from-typical-series-a-financing-documents/)? [*Yokum Taku*](https://twitter.com/Yokum), 2010. A nice matrix comparing the details of the Series Seed, Y Combinator, and TechStars standard documents. 

[Why There Will Never be a Standard Set of Seed Documents](http://www.jasonmendelson.com/archives/2010/03/why-there-will-never-be-a-standard-set-of-seed-documents-a-k-a-why-brad-feld-will-fail.php) [(aka why Brad Feld will Fail)](http://www.jasonmendelson.com/archives/2010/03/why-there-will-never-be-a-standard-set-of-seed-documents-a-k-a-why-brad-feld-will-fail.php), Jason Mendelson, 2010. Perhaps the more important takeaway is that the National Venture Capital Association docs "are too complicated for 90% of the folks out there doing the deals."  

[Don’t be creative about the wrong things](http://cdixon.org/2010/02/16/dont-be-creative-about-the-wrong-things/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2010. "your deal terms should be plain vanilla. These things are time tested and you are far more likely to screw things up than create value by tinkering with them."
