Last week, a NY Federal Court was not sympathetic to defendants' pleas that they were being harassed by a patent troll:

<blockquote>Deluxe attempts to disparage MPV as “a non-practicing entity,” apparently hoping to take advantage of the general disfavor in which patent assertion entities are held today. However, MPV is not a “patent troll,” but instead is a small company run by the inventor of the technology that Deluxe misappropriated, whose commercialization efforts were frustrated by rampant infringement both in the United States and in Europe by Deluxe and former defendant Technicolor.</blockquote>

Judge McMahon continues, "Indeed, it is at least in part because of the fact that MPV was blocked from commercializing [the] invention that further delaying the ultimate resolution of this case will inflict substantial prejudice on MPV."  After finding the plaintiff's patent valid and infringed in January 2014, last week's ruling refused to stay the trial on damages pending an appeal to the Federal Circuit. <em>Medien Patent Verwaltung AG v. Warner Bros. Ent. Inc</em>., No. 10 Civ. 4119 (McMahon)(S.D.N.Y. March 2014).

A warning: if you're going to call the plaintiff out as a patent troll, take a moment to see if they actually are one, and make sure you can convince the judge. It can be a particularly dangerous tactic in a case like this one, where the <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US7187633" target="_blank">patent at issue</a> involves software for preventing theft of copyrighted movies.
