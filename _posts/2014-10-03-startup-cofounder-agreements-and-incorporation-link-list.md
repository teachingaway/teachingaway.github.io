<p class="big-text">Useful reading on pre-incorporation cofounder agreements and selecting a corporate entity. Sorting your cofounder agreement and basic incorporation can be simple. Don't overlawyer it.</p>

Our technology law "Link List” series collects useful guidance for startups.[^1]  The first installment helped startups [hire the right lawyer](/tech-law-link-list-hiring-lawyers/). 

[^1]: This is advice worth reading, but it may not be advice that’s right for your startup.

### Pre-Incorporation  

Founders can collaborate on a project before dealing with the expense and distraction of formal incorporation. But they should put their collaboration agreement in writing. Even an informal written agreement, in your own words, is better than a verbal agreement. 

* [Cofounder Collaboration](http://adlervermillion.com/cofounder-collaboration/).  *[Zeke Vermillion](https://twitter.com/zmillion)*, 2011. Negotiating every legal issue before actually starting a project will distract you from building a minimum viable product. Zeke's [Founders' Agreement Template](https://www.docracy.com/6348/founders-agreement-template#) helps  founders collaborate on early-stage business projects on fair terms, without a lot of hassle or paperwork. 

* Vesting - Discuss how long cofounders will need to stick with the project to earn their ownership share. Assume that a cofounder will drift off to a different project, and define what will happen to her pre-incorporation ownership stake. Put it in writing. A reasonable pre-incorporation vesting schedule might be "if you leave before we incorporate, you lose *all* ownership interest."   

* [When Do I need to Incorporate a Company?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/07/20/when-do-i-need-to-incorporate-a-company/) *[Yokum Taku](https://twitter.com/Yokum)*, 2009. Startups should incorporate if they have more than one founder, start creating serious intellectual property, need to hire employees or contractors, issue stock options, or get visas. 

* [Why Incorporating My Startup was My Worst Mistake](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2399139). Hacker News, 2011. [Grellas](https://twitter.com/grellas): "Corporations are not particularly hard or expensive to start, maintain, or dissolve - but you need to be at a stage of life where a thousand dollars here or there is not a major burden." The original link is [broken](https://web.archive.org/web/20110404132033/http://heyhamza.com/why-incorporating-my-startup-was-my-worst-mis), but the HN comments are more interesting anyway. 

### Formation: Use Clerky 

* [Clerky](https://www.clerky.com/) - A spin-off from the law firm Orrick, Clerky helps you generate founders’ arrangements for a VC-backable DE corporation.

* [The Deflation of Startup Law Continues: Clerky](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2013/09/02/deflation-of-startup-law-clerky/). *[Jose Ancer](https://twitter.com/ancerj)*, 2013. Clerky is "LegalZoom prices, but for premium, startup-focused documents." 

* [Hacker News conversation on Clerky](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5357618). 2013. From Grellas: "The beauty of Clerky, as I see it, is that the founders, having worked extensively as superb startup lawyers in their own right, have a keen sense of how all this works and are aiming to develop a service that truly deals with the issues that have burdened clients and lawyers alike."

### LLC or S Corp or C Corp?

If you need venture capital, form a Delaware C-Corp. If your business will never need VC style investors, form an LLC. 

The difference between an "S Corp" and a “C Corp” is just a tax election: S Corp avoids double-taxation, but C Corp allows multiple classes of stockholders (which VCs will demand). “Double taxation” isn’t as bad as it sounds because a clever accountant can often reduce or eliminate the extra tax.  

**Entity** | **Features** | **Notes**
LLC | flexible; tax pass through | &nbsp;
C&nbsp;Corp | VCs Require it. Pays separate taxes | A regular corporation
S&nbsp;Corp | tax pass through | &nbsp;
B&nbsp;Corp | commits to a social mission | like Etsy, Warby Parker & Patagonia

* [What type of entity should I form?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/03/12/what-type-of-entity-should-i-form/) *[Yokum Taku](https://twitter.com/Yokum)*, 2009.  If you want to raise venture capital, form a Delaware C Corp. 

* [Startup Company Form: LLC or S-Corp?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13752) *[Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg)* in HN Comments, 2007. "Ordinarily a startup should be a C corp. It's cheaper to be an LLC, but if you plan to succeed, you may as well do things right from the start."

* [Corporate Entities](http://avc.com/2010/02/corporate-entity/). *[Fred Wilson](https://twitter.com/fredwilson)*, 2010. "When you start a business, it is important to recognize that it will eventually be something entirely different than you. You won't own all of it. You won't want to be liable for everything that the company does. And you won't want to pay taxes on its profits." 

* [B-Corp: Companies with Benefits](http://www.newyorker.com/?p=2640342&currentPage=all). *James Surowiecki*, 2014.    "Becoming a B corp raises the reputational cost of abandoning your social goals. It’s what behavioral economists call a ‘commitment device’—a way of insuring that you’ll live up to your promises." 

### Where to Incorporate? Delaware? NY? California?

Delaware offers the strongest corporate laws and many investors will expect a Delaware corporation. The downside is that incorporating in Delaware will add some extra paperwork and a Delaware "franchise tax" of about $350/year for a pre-revenue startup. 

* [What state should I incorporate in?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2009/03/03/what-state-should-i-incorporate-in/) *[Yokum Taku](https://twitter.com/Yokum)*, 2009. Incorporate in Delaware (probably). 

* [How do you calculate Delaware franchise taxes?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/02/01/how-do-you-calculate-delaware-franchise-taxes/) *[Yokum Taku](https://twitter.com/Yokum)*, 2008. Startups that incorporate in Delaware need to pay an annual "franchise tax." Its about $350/yr for a pre-revenue company. 

* [When do I "really" need to qualify my Delaware-formed startup?](http://siliconhillslawyer.com/2013/10/04/texas-startups-qualifying-foreign-entity/) *[Jose Ancer](https://twitter.com/ancerj)*, 2013. Delaware companies generally *also* need to “qualify” in the states where they “conduct business.” For example, if your office is in New York and you incorporate in Delaware, you also need to “qualify” in NY by filling out a form and paying a fee.
