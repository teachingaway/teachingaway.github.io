DRAFT POST

Our technology law [Link List](/tags/#link+list) series collects useful startup guidance from around the internet.[^1]  This post is about raising a Series A round.

[^1]: This is advice worth reading, but it may not be advice that’s right for your startup.


# Raising Money

[How to Fund a Startup](http://paulgraham.com/startupfunding.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg), 2005.  As usual, Paul Graham's essays are a good jumping off point. This one provides an overview of the startup funding process. 

[Fundraising Survival Guide](http://www.paulgraham.com/fundraising.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg),  2008. Lots of practical advice here, especially for early stage startups. For example, fit meetings with investors into the spare moments in your development schedule, rather than doing development in the spare moments between meetings with investors. And be ready to downshift into consulting if appropriate. 

[Hackers Guide to Investors](http://paulgraham.com/guidetoinvestors.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg),  2007. What motivates VCs and angel investors? VCs are looking for big hits: "Currently the way VCs seem to operate is to invest in a bunch of companies, most of which fail, and one of which is Google."  Angel investors are satisfied with smaller wins, but want to invest at much lower valuations. 

[Fundraising Mistakes Founders Make](http://blog.samaltman.com/fundraising-mistakes-founder-make). Sam Altman, 2014. Get intros to investors, talk to them, *in parallel, not in series*.
Explain the company’s mission, product, current traction, future vision, the market, the competition, your long-term competitive advantage, how you make money, and the team. Get investors to compete with each other to offer the best terms.

# Pitching and Investor Presentations

[Pitch Yourself, Not Your Idea](http://cdixon.org/2009/11/14/pitch-yourself-not-your-idea/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. Tell the story of someone who has been building stuff her whole life and now just needs some capital to take it to the next level.

[How to Present to Investors](http://paulgraham.com/investors.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg),  2010. Practical advice on giving presentations:  describe a compelling product and get right to the demo; focus on a narrow solution to a widespread problem, don't waste time on business models or secondary matters.  

[How to Pitch Your Startup On Stage](http://justinkan.com/how-to-pitch-your-startup-on-stage). Justin Kan, 2014. How you pitch is important, because investors aren't obligated to expend the mental energy to figure out what you are talking about. Follow this basic flow: market and problem, your solution, evidence that your solution will work (traction, sales, your team’s expertise, etc).

# Venture Capital - Series A

[Best Practices for Raising a VC Round](http://cdixon.org/2011/05/04/best-practices-for-raising-a-vc-round/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2011. Pick a minimum valuation, never share the names of other VCs that are interested, talk to about 5 VCs, consider offering certain VCs a "buy it now" valuation, set timelines and move quickly. 

[Why it’s Critical that you Reference Check Your VC](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/12/14/why-its-critical-that-you-reference-check-your-vc/). [*Mark Suster*](https://twitter.com/msuster), 2010. Get to know VCs over a long period of time. Check a reference list, and don't stop with the list they give you, check with companies that went through difficult times.  

[Does a VC’s brand matter?](http://cdixon.org/2009/12/05/does-a-vcs-brand-matter/) [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2009. How much should you weigh the brand of the VCs?  A little, but a lot less than most people assume.

[How to Align Founder and VC Incentives: Why Fund Size Matters](http://tomtunguz.com/how-to-align-founder-and-vc-incentives-why-fund-size-matters/). [*Tomasz Tunguz*](https://twitter.com/ttunguz), 2013. Fund sizes dictate VC strategy. To achieve their target returns. The larger the fund, the larger the exits must be for the venture investors to be successful. A $50M fund and a $500M fund must pursue very different investment and management styles.

[Inside versus outside financings: the nightclub effect](http://cdixon.org/2010/06/08/inside-versus-outside-financings-the-nightclub-effect/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2010. You may need to choose between an *inside round*, where the existing investors lead the new financing, or an *outside round*, where new investors lead. This will raise interesting game-theoretic dynamics among management, existing investors, and prospective new investors.
