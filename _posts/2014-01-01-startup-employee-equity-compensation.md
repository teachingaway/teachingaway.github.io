# Equity Compensation 

Know the difference between "stock options" and "restricted stock" and, more importantly, the tax consequences of each.  A **stock option** is the right to buy stock in the future at a pre-determined price. **Restricted stock** is almost the reverse: the employee receives the stock today, but the startup can buy it back from the employee in the future. Restricted stock tends to be the better tax arrangement for the employee, especially for a pre-series A company.  

## Number of Shares Outstanding (Fully Diluted)

Employers love to offer thousands of shares of company equity. "Thousands" is a big number, but by itself, the number of shares is meaningless. Imagine I told you I had a million dollars of gold divided up into equal-size pieces. Then I offered to give you 10,000 "pieces" of gold in exchange for 4 years of work. Obviously, you'd want to know the weight of a "piece." A milligram? A microgram? It makes a difference. 

What employee-candidates really want to know is what percentage of the company does the equity represent. Specifically, they should ask for the number of shares outstanding on a "**fully diluted**" basis. The number of shares needs to include the common stock, preferred stock, options outstanding, unissued shares remaining in the options pool, warrants and convertible notes.

"The only thing that matters in terms of your equity when you join a startup is what percent of the company they are giving you.  If management tells you the number of shares and not the total shares outstanding so you can’t compute the percent you own – *don’t join the company!*"

## Stock Options - Employee's Perspective

**Basics**. Stock options are a contract giving an employee the right to buy shares, in the future, at a pre-determined price. Ideally, the employee gets the right to buy shares at today's price (say, $1), but at a future date when everyone else is paying a much higher price (say, $100). 

**Tax**. Generally, the employee is not taxed on the grant date, but on the exercise date (the day the employee pays to buy the stock). The tax is based on the difference between the strike price (what the employee pays to buy the company) and the value of the options on the exercise date. This can result in an unfunded tax liability. That is, the newly purchased stock may be valuable on paper, but the employee may not be allowed to sell shares on the open market.

## Restricted Stock

In a restricted stock grant, the employee owns normal "common stock," but the company has the right to buy the stock back in certain circumstances. Restricted stock can offer major tax advantages for founders and early employees. An employee can pay tax on restricted stock *right away* by filing an 83(b) tax election. If the company's valuation is very low (e.g., pre-series A), the tax will be low. 

For later employees, the company's valuation will be higher, and employees will end up paying more substantial tax on upon receipt of their restricted stock. This may be a bad deal for the later employees because they are paying tax on stock that may one day be worthless. Because of this risk, stock **options** are likely to be a better deal for later employees. 

409(a) valuations are not necessary for restricted stock grants.

# Vesting

A "vesting schedule" incentivizes employees to stick with their employer, by gradually sweetening the equity incentives over time.  

The most common vesting scenario is "4 years with a 1-year cliff." This means that 1/4 of your equity will vest after your first full year with the employer, and after that, it 1/12 will vest after each additional 3 month period you stay with the employer. Note: you don't need to agree to just a vesting schedule just because it's commonly used. Faster or slower may be appropriate, depending on the circumstances. 

[Vesting is a Hack](http://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2012/04/vesting-is-a-hack/) - [*Dan Shapiro*](https://twitter.com/danshapiro), 2012. "stock grants are, at their heart, a crude hack to avoid taxes.  Vesting is a hack to the hack – and one almost every founder needs."

## Can the Startup Repurchase Vested Stock? 

Some stock option grants will give the company the right to repurchase an employees fully vested stock at "fair market value." Of course, the company will pick a "fair market value" that may not seem fair to the employee. 

YCombinator's Sam Altman called this arrangement ["horrible" for employees](http://blog.samaltman.com/employee-equity). Angellist's Babak Nivi suggests that employees should "[run screaming from the right to purchase vested stock](http://venturehacks.com/articles/vesting-microhacks)."

[Can the Company Take Back my Vested Shares](http://stockoptioncounsel.com/blog/standards-ownership-canthecomanytakebackmyvestedshares)? [*Mary Russell*](https://twitter.com/StockOptionCnsl), 2014. Provides an example of how a startup's "fair market value" repurchase right could mean the difference between a $60k payday or a $1.6MM payout at an IPO.  


[Supersize Your Vesting with these Microhacks](http://venturehacks.com/articles/vesting-microhacks). [*Babak Nivi*](https://twitter.com/nivi), 2007. 

## Accelerating the Vesting Schedule

Founders and early employees may be able to negotiate for an "acceleration"  clause - a clause that shortens the vesting period under certain conditions.

-  "Acceleration" generally refers to automatic vesting upon a merger or acquisition of the company. This is favorable to the employee, but the acquiring company will not be happy if all of the key employees vanish soon after the acquisition. 
- "Double-Trigger Acceleration" refers to automatic vesting upon both (i) a merger and (ii) the new company firing the employee. This should be less objectionable to startups and acquiring companies because it still incentives employees to stay with the new company after a merger. 


## Acquisitions: Assumption of Option Plan

Employees should know what will happen to their option plan if the company is acquired. Will the options vest immediately? Will the new company "assume" the option plan and give you the same deal? Some option plans do not require an acquiring company to assume the plan, which can hurt employees. 

[If you have startup stock options, check your option plan](http://blog.conspire.com/post/112700131803/if-you-have-startup-stock-options-check-your). [Alex Devkar](https://twitter.com/alexdevkar), 2015. "The acquirer—your new boss—comes to you and says that the remaining half of your options are gone. If you want to keep your job, you have to sign a new equity agreement which won’t make you nearly as much money and comes with a new 4 year vesting schedule that starts today. Can they do that?"

# Tax Issues 

[Incentive Stock Options vs. Nonqualified Stock Options](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2013/05/15/incentive-stock-options-vs-nonqualified-stock-options/).  [*Joe Wallin*](https://twitter.com/joewallin), 2013. Incentive Stock Options ("ISO") offer some tax advantage, but substantially increase complexity. Under many conditions, the Alternative Minimum Tax will eat away at the ISO's benefits anyway. Nonqualified Stock Options ("NQO") are less complicated, and often preferable to ISOs. Joe has previously written about this issue [here](http://www.startuplawblog.com/2010/08/11/top-reasons-nqos-over-isos/). 

[Tips on Negotiating Equity Incentives when Joining an Early Stage Startup](http://stockoptioncounsel.com/blog/joining-an-early-stage-startup-negotiateyour-equity-wisely-with-stock-option-counsel-tips/2014/2/12). [*Mary Russell*](https://twitter.com/StockOptionCnsl), 2014. This post includes a good tax comparison of (a) restricted stock, (b) non-qualified stock options (early exercised), (c) incentive stock options, (d) restricted stock units, and  (e) non-qualified stock options (not early exercised). 


## The 83(b) Tax Election 

Consider filing an 83(b) election when you receive stock with a very low valuation (especially if you are a founder or a very early employee). Talk to your lawyer. When done correctly, the tax savings can be enormous. 

The 83(b) election is only available if the stock is subject to a **"substantial risk of forfeiture"** (a specially defined tax phrase). This may include, for example: (i) receiving stock subject to vesting, and (ii) *exercising* stock options and receive *unvested* stock (that is, the stock you receive is still subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture"). 

[83(b) Elections](http://www.startuplawblog.com/section-83b/). [*Joe Wallin*](https://twitter.com/joewallin), 2012. 

[What is an 83(b) election?](http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/02/15/what-is-an-83b-election/) [*Yokum Taku*](https://twitter.com/Yokum), 2007. When you receive shares subject to vesting, an 83(b) election lets you pay tax on the shares immediately, when the tax burden is smallest. 

## The 409(a) Valuation 

The exercise price of stock options must be set at, or above, the fair market value of the underlying shares at the time of the grant. If it's not, then the IRS (and California) will impose some extremely heavy tax penalties. This is a problem for the *company* as well as the employee, because the company must withhold these taxes and penalties. 

To be safe, the fair market value should be determined by a "409(a)" valuation (a valuation method specifically approved by the IRS).  Startups can hire a 409(a) valuation firm to perform the calculations. 


[Employee Equity: The Option Price](http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-the-option-strike-price/). [*Fred Wilson*](https://twitter.com/fredwilson), 2010. "Companies are paying $5000 to $25,000 per year" to 409(a) valuation consultants. Fred also notes that employees who get hired after a big up-round of financing will tend to get less-valuable stock options (because the fair market value will be higher).
