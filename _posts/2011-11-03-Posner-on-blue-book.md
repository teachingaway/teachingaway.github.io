Judge Posner renews his disgust with the Bluebook in this <a title="Bluebook Blues" href="http://www.yalelawjournal.org/images/pdfs/940.pdf">recent Yale Law Review article.</a> The 12 pages of prose and sarcasm neatly eviscerate a cherished legal institution:

<blockquote>The Bluebook is elaborate but not purposive. Form is prescribed for the sake of form, not of function. The vacuity and tendentiousness of so much legal reasoning are concealed by the awesome scrupulousness with which a set of intricate rules governing the form of citations is observed.</blockquote>

For example,

<blockquote>The basic rule of abbreviating, ignored by the authors of The Bluebook, is to avoid non-obvious abbreviations. An example that I have picked literally at random is “C.Ag.” What does “C.Ag.” stand for? Why, of course, the Código de Águas of Brazil. Now suppose one had occasion to cite the Código de Águas. Why would one want to abbreviate it?</blockquote>

The bluebook is long and mostly pointless. Its grown from 26 pages in the 1927 first edition to its current 511 pages. Posner correlates this growth with the legal profession's increasingly urgent desire "to convince the laity of the inscrutable rigor of its methods." That is, these intricate rules and esoteric tomes help us justify stratospheric fees for a service that is at best "careful reading, rhetoric, and common sense."

Posner's article takes a brief interlude to provide his own citation guide. In 3 pages, he covers the relevant principles of citation and provides useful examples. Need to cite some obscure precedent? Just apply the principles. You can devote your newfound free time to "legal education or practice."
