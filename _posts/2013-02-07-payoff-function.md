Most people think the role of lawyers in business is to reduce risk. But that is an incomplete picture, not to mention a boring job description for anyone who likes doing deals. It calls to mind the annoying pencil-necked weenie from central casting who won’t let the heroes do anything fun.

Of course we do tend to focus on risks, but I prefer to think of it as maximizing the payoff function. The economics of entrepreneurial risk-taking is based on optionality. Short-term planning, rapid iteration, and cost-control carry the day over long-term planning, experience, and bold investments. If this sounds counter-intuitive, go read Nassim Taleb’s essay on “<a href="http://www.edge.org/conversation/understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility" target="_blank">antifragility</a>”. (My post is entirely ripped off from Taleb’s argument.)

Controlling the payoff function allows risk-takers to benefit from complexity. You want a convex function where the cost of a failed attempt is bounded at the lower limit, and the potential payout of the less frequent success is upwardly-sloping -- theoretically unlimited. Given the right payoff function, you can benefit from risk rather than be damaged by it. This is an “antifragile” state, to use Taleb’s coined phrase.

If you are engaged in risky activity with unknown limits such as blue sky research -- or speculative business ventures -- most of your attempts to produce value will fail. Occasionally though, an attempt will succeed, and the magnitude of that success can be enormous. Einstein’s publication of general relativity. Brin and Page launching Google. That is why some VCs say that they invest in entrepreneurs not business plans. A great entrepreneur will iterate (and fail) many times but will do so in a way that is not costly. Then she will succeed. Our job as business lawyers and advisers is to help build this asymmetric payoff function so that you can benefit from your foray into complexity, for reasons other than luck.
