<p class="big-text">This collection of NYC venture capital funds is intended to be a useful starting point for entrepreneurs raising early capital. Finding someone in your network to make a warm introduction will be far more effective than cold emailing. </p>

For tips on requesting introductions, read these two posts by [Hunter Walk](http://hunterwalk.com/2014/08/11/why-most-vcs-wont-intro-you-to-other-vcs-unless-you-follow-these-steps/) and [Roy Bahat](http://also.roybahat.com/post/92544681186/introductions-and-the-forward-intro-email). Do your homework, and make sure your startup fits into the VCs "investment thesis" before asking for an intro. More guidance at our [raising capital for startups](/raising-capital-for-startups/) post.
