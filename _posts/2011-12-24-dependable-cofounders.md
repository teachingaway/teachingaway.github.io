I <a href="/law-firm-as-startup/">posted</a> on September 28 comparing our law firm to a startup and promised to write in more detail on the key inputs: dependable cofounders, paying clients, adequate financing, and efficient technology. This week, a post on cofounders -- aka partners. Can’t live with ‘em, can’t live without ‘em... only kidding, guys!

But seriously, involving partners in a venture is a game-changer from going it alone. Something almost magical happens when a group tackles a common project. Whether we call it synergy, serendipity, or complex results of human-scale cellular automata, this is merely restating conventional wisdom. The choice of partners in any business venture determines the results. That’s why experienced investors back people, not features or ideas.

In choosing people, I consider character, motivation, and talent in that order of importance. Yes, you need all of those things, but each trait is no good without the one before it. Without character -- good moral judgment -- motivation and talent lead to Marc Dreier and Bernie Madoff. Without motivation, talent remains untapped. And while I am fortunate to have talented partners, I know that given character and motivation, talent (or at least, skill) can be learned.

There’s no formula for identifying character and motivation. It comes down to intuition -- you know it when you see it. Or you don’t, and are proven wrong. But over years of observing clients as well as my own decisions, I’ve come to trust my intuition about people and partnerships.

Whether a partnership is going to be productive is apparent at the earliest stages, in negotiating the partnership deal. Whatever changes after that point, sharp negotiating and strategic behavior at the initial stage usually signals trouble ahead. And good faith dealing, honesty about differences and divergent goals at the beginning sets the stage for a robust relationship through the ups and downs of being in business.</div>
