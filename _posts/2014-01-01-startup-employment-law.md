# Hiring Engineers


[The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html). Joel Spolsky, 2006. 

[Hiring a VP Engineering for your Internet Startup](http://cdixon.org/2008/04/17/what-to-look-for-in-hiring-a-vp-engineering-for-your-internet-startup/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2008. 

[Recruiting Programmers to Your Startup](http://cdixon.org/2011/12/29/recruiting-programmers-to-your-startup/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2011. 

[How to Hire](http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-hire).  [*Sam Altman*](https://twitter.com/sama), 2013. Hiring decisions are critical, so don't be afraid to spend time on them. Consider having prospects audition for a job instead of interview for it. That is, hire them for a two-day project as a contractor and see how it goes.

# Employment Contracts

**At Will**. Most employment contracts are for "at will" employment, as opposed to employment for a particular length of time.

# Employment Law Compliance

Many Federal and NY employment apply as soon as a company hires its first employee. Others kick in as the company hires additional employees. Here's a quick summary of laws that apply to companies based on the number of employees.  

\# | Law | Details
| -- | -- | --| 
4 | NY Human Rights Law | No discrimination based on age, race, gender, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship status, etc. *New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law §§ 290-301*. 
15 | ADA | Forbids discrimination against the disabled. (Americans with Disabilities Act). 
15 | Title VII | Prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).
15 | PDA | Forbids discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. (Pregnancy Discrimination Act).
20 | ADEA | Forbids the discrimination against people over 40. (Age Discrimination in Employment Act).

# Firing 

Document a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for filing anyone, regardless of whether they are "at will." Talk to your lawyer. Consider making a separation payment to the employee in exchange for signing a release of any and all claims against the company. 

**References**. It can be dangerous to provide a negative reference, even if it's an honest description of the former employee's work. Instead, just confirm the former employee's dates of employment and say "we have a policy of not providing references." 


## Firing Employees 

[Firing](http://cdixon.org/2012/06/20/firing/). [*Chris Dixon*](https://twitter.com/cdixon), 2012. Fire early. It's terrible, but if you don’t fire the bad employees, you risk running out of money for your startup, and everyone loses their job.  

[Startup Mantra: Hire Fast, Fire Fast](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2011/05/26/startup-mantra-hire-fast-fire-fast/). [*Mark Suster*](https://twitter.com/msuster), 2011. "I have never regretted firing anybody. Not once. I have on many occasions regretted not firing somebody quickly enough." Mark reiterates this point in [How to Deal with Pure Recruiting Mistakes.](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2013/11/27/how-to-deal-with-pure-recruiting-mistakes/), 2013.

[NY State WARN Act](http://labor.ny.gov/workforcenypartners/warn/warnportal.shtm).  NY companies with 50 or more employees need to provide 90 days notice of any mass layoffs. 

Federal WARN Act. Companies with 100 or more employees need to provide notice of mass layoffs. 

## Firing Cofounders

[Parting Ways With A Founding Team Member](http://avc.com/2010/06/parting-ways-with-a-founding-team-member/). [*Fred Wilson*](https://twitter.com/fredwilson), 2010. "If I look back at our most successful investments over the last 25 years... almost every single one of them has seen a founder or critical founding team member shown the door as the company scaled. It's almost inevitable."

[When to fire your co-founders](http://venturehacks.com/articles/fire-co-founders). Venture Hacks, 2010. More about screening for good cofounders than firing bad ones.
