<p class="big-text"><em>“Your clones are impressive. You must be very proud.”</em> – Obi Wan Kenobi.</p>

Copying Chun Li's 'head stomp' would be stealing, but copying Sagat’s 'tiger knee' would just be borrowing inspiration. In 2012, one court decided that copying the size of the Tetris game board (10x20) was infringement, and then four months later, a different court decided that copying the size of the Triple Town game board (6x6) was allowed. Copyright infringement cases can seem arbitrary, but looking at a few examples will help sort out the madness.

# Identical Twins: Always Infringement

A clone that's basically identical to the original game is always going to be copyright infringement. Changing the name from "Donkey Kong" to "Crazy Kong" will not fool a Federal Judge. 

<hr class="tall">

## Crazy Kong: Crazy Infringement (1982)

<img src="/images/copyright/donkey-kong-v-crazy-kong-clone-copyright-infringement.png" class="medium-image">

Elcon made a straight-up identical Donkey Kong clone. According to the judge, Crazy Kong "embodies audio-video material, including the characters on the screen and the sound, that is virtually identical" to Donkey Kong. [*Nintendo v. Elcon*, 564 F. Supp. 937 (ED Mich 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14413211357527714092). Crazy Kong didn't just copy game mechanics or unprotectable ideas. Crazy Kong copied every detail. Predictably, this is copyright infringement. It always is: 

- "Puck Man", an identical clone of Pac-Man, was likewise found to be copyright infringement in [*Midway v. Artic*, 704 F.2d 1009 (7th Cir. 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3345463532258240978). Artic just copied the name “Puck Man” from the original Japanese version of the game. [*Midway v. Artic*, 547 F.Supp. 999 (ND Ill 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3162513435280413681).
- "Space Defense", an identical clone of "Defender" was copyright infringement in [*Williams Electronics v. Artic International,* 685 F.2d 870 (3rd Cir. 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8334646367831709790). 
- "Scramble", an identical clone of "Scramble" was copyright infringement in [*Stern Electronics v. Kaufman*, 669 F.2d 852 (2nd Cir. 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7204019639108685629). 

**Takeaway**: Identical cloning is copyright infringement. 

<hr class="tall">


## The Taint of Originality: Hi-Lo Double Up Joker Poker (1986)

<img src="/images/copyright/kramer-v-andrews-joker-poker.jpg" class="medium-image" >

Kramer made *Hi-Lo Double Up Joker Poker* (Old Reliable). Soon after, Drew Distributing and Lynch Enterprises made *Joker Poker 54*. Kramer sued for copyright infringement. 

This case is very different from Crazy Kong because the video game was basically just poker played on a computer. Kramer can't copyright poker, or a video game that's pure poker, because pure poker is public domain. It's been around forever. 

However, *Hi-Lo Double Up Joker Poker* wasn't pure poker, it was poker with a few little twists and some original artwork. The judge decided that these additions gave the game a "taint of originality" worthy of some minimal copyright protection. A game with just a "taint of originality" is only entitled to a very thin type of copyright protection -- protection that only works against nearly identical clones. 

Joker Poker 54 was a nearly identical clone. The changes were superficial, like changing the "configuration of the board that holds the ROMS, changing some words in the audiovisual display, and by changing the design on some of the cards. Specifically, he inserted the name 'Lynch Enterprises' in the attract mode, inserted the insignia 'LE' on the back of the playing cards, and changed some of the wording in the attract and play modes." 

These superficial changes were not enough to save Joker Poker 54, especially because it copied every other detail of the original game, right down to the easter egg: 

> Kramer Manufacturing embedded in its program a hidden legend that would appear only when the game's buttons were pressed in an abnormal sequence. The defendants' program shows that the legend is included in its copy.

The judge called the two games "virtually identical" and noted that the dissimilarities "appear quite obviously to be the result of a studied effort to make minor distinctions between the two" games. The defendant was trying "to appropriate the plaintiff's design either outright or by frivolous variation." [*Kramer Manufacturing v. Andrews*, 783 F. 2d 421 (4th Cir. 1986)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5294172034546412150)

**Pro tip**: If you're pirating someone else's game, don't put a pirate on your promo material. 

**Takeaway**: Video Games based on existing real-life games or sports will receive a very thin type of copyright protection. They can stop identical clones, but not much else.  

<hr class="tall"> 


# Fraternal Twins: Is the Clone "Substantially Similar" to the Original? 

For more creative and original games, the question isn't whether the games are identical, it's whether the clone is "substantially similar" to the original. This is where copyright law gets murky. Copyright infringement isn't just about *how much* of the original game was copied, it's about *what types* of games elements were copied. 

Copyright protects *creative expression*, but never *ideas*. Lawyers call this the **idea/expression dichotomy**. This policy of free ideas is so powerful that if the idea and its expression are inseparable, then the idea drags it's expression into the public domain. This is the **merger rule**. Copyright can't protect **useful articles** like a trackball controller. Finally, copyright never protects cliches or common tropes. This is the **scènes à faire** doctrine (French for "that which must be done").  

The "substantial similarity" test involves (1) filtering away all ideas and cliches, and then (2) comparing the remaining creative expression in the two games. If you think creative expression in the second game is "substantially similar" to the original (and if you were sitting on a federal jury), then the clone would infringe the original's copyright. Examples might be helpful.

## Copying Ideas is Not Infringement: Asteroids v. Meteors (1981) 

<img src="/images/copyright/asteroids-v-meteors.jpg" class="medium-image">

*"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1."* -- C3PO

Atari made the original Asteroids game. Amusement World made a knockoff called Meteors. Atari was not amused, and sued for copyright infringement. 

Copyright never protects "ideas", it can only protect the "creative expression" of an idea. In the case of *Asteroids v. Meteors*, the judge identified 22 similarities, and decided that the "defendants based their game on plaintiff's copyrighted game; to put it bluntly, defendants took plaintiff's idea. However, the copyright laws do not prohibit this." .

The 22 similarities involved the graphics, game mechanics and sound. According to the judge, they were all part of the unprotectable "idea" of a "a video game in which a player fights his way through space rocks and enemy spaceships." 

The court also noted 9 differences, which seem to mainly involve the more advanced graphics in Meteors. Here are some examples:  

- Meteors is in color, while Asteroids is in black and white. The symbols for rocks and spaceships in Meteors are shaded to appear three-dimensional, unlike the flat, schematic figures in Asteroids.

- At the beginning of Meteors, the player's spaceship is shown blasting off the earth, whereas "Asteroids" begins with the player's spaceship in outer space.

- The player's spaceship in Meteors fires faster and can fire continuously, unlike the player's spaceship in Asteroids, which can fire only bursts of projectiles.

- In Meteors, after the player's spaceship is destroyed, when the new spaceship appears on the screen, the game resumes at the same pace as immediately before the last ship was destroyed; in Asteroids the game resumes at a slower pace.

These changes were enough, at the time, to avoid infringement. "Defendants used plaintiff's idea and those portions of plaintiff's expression that were inextricably linked to that idea [this is the "merger rule"]. The remainder of defendants' expression is different from plaintiff's expression. Therefore, the Court finds that defendants' Meteors game is not substantially similar to and is not an infringing copy of plaintiff's Asteroids game." [*Atari v. Amusement World*, 547 F.Supp. 222 (D. Md. 1981)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6441518363892064579).

**Takeaway**: Copying a game's "ideas" is not infringement. But don't take too much away from Asteroids v. Meteors. I think the judge lumped too much creative expression in with "ideas" and gave too much weight to the minor changes Meteor's made to its graphics. 

<hr class="tall"> 


## Copying Creative Expression is Infringement: Pac-Man v. K.C. Munchkin (1982)

<img src="/images/copyright/kc-munchkin-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image">

K.C. Munchkin was an early Pac-Man clone, but not an identical copy. This means the court needed to "filter out" the unprotectable elements before looking for substantial similarity and copyright infringement. The judge first separated the unprotectable **idea** of Pac-Man: 

 > PAC-MAN is a maze-chase game in which the player scores points by guiding a central figure through various passageways of a maze and at the same time avoiding collision with certain opponents or pursuit figures which move independently about the maze. Under certain conditions, the central figure may temporarily become empowered to chase and overtake the opponents, thereby scoring bonus points. 

The court then filtered out the unprotectable **scènes à faire** (i.e., stock video game elements):

 > The maze and scoring table are standard game devices, and the tunnel exits are nothing more than the commonly used "wrap around" concept adapted to a maze-chase game. Similarly, the use of dots provides a means by which a player's performance can be gauged and rewarded with the appropriate number of points, and by which to inform the player of his or her progress. Given their close connection with the underlying game, K.C. Munchkin's maze design, scoring table, and "dots" are sufficiently different to preclude a finding of infringement on that basis alone.

The court then looked at Pac-Man's protectable **creative expression**. A maze-chase game "does not dictate the use of a 'gobbler' and 'ghost monsters.' Those characters are wholly fanciful creations, without reference to the real world." Finally, comparing only the protectable creative elements, the court found copyright infringement: 

 > The K.C. Munchkin gobbler has several blatantly similar features, including the relative size and shape of the “body,” the V-shaped “mouth,” its distinctive gobbling action (with appropriate sounds), and especially the way in which it disappears upon being captured. An examination of the K.C. Munchkin ghost monsters reveals even more significant visual similarities. In size, shape, and manner of movement, they are virtually identical to their Pac-Man counterparts. K.C. Munchkin’s monsters, for example, exhibit the same peculiar “eye” and “leg” movement. Both games, moreover, express the role reversal and “regeneration” process with such great similarity that an ordinary observer could conclude only that North American copied plaintiffs’ Pac-Man. 
 
[*Atari v. Philips*, 672 F.2d 607 (7th Cir. 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16433139020722034724).

**Takeaway**: The *idea* of a maze-chase game is not copyrightable, and the *game mechanics* that necessarily flow from the idea are not copyrightable. However, the *creative expression* of a gobbler and ghosts, the sound effects and the "role reversal" mechanism are protectable video game elements. 

<hr class="tall">


## Porting is Infringement: Galaxian v. Galaxian (1982)

<img src="/images/copyright/midway-galaxian-v-bandai-galaxian.jpg" class="medium-image">

Midway made the arcade game *Pac-Man*, and Bandai cloned it with the handheld *Packri Monster*. Midway made the arcade game *Galaxian*, and Bandai cloned it with a handheld game called... *Galaxian*. Let's talk about Galaxian. 

As always, the judge first separated the unprotectable *idea* of the Galaxian game from its *expression*. 

> Here, the idea of Midway's Galaxian is relatively simple and easily expressed: it is an outer space video game in which the player controls a rocket ship defending itself against a swarm of computer-controlled attacking aliens who attempt to bomb and collide with the player's ship. 

With the "idea" out of the way, the Judge dug into Bandai for copying so much of Galaxian's creative expression: 

 > It is also clear that, in expressing its version of the game idea, there was no necessity for Bandai to mimic Midway's expression of this idea which involves such elements as the particular insectile shape of the aliens, their movements, and the musical theme.  

The judge reviewed the expert opinion of two music professors, and agreed that the "*musical* themes of the two Galaxian games are fundamentally identical."  Likewise, the *alien enemies* were similar. "The Bandai aliens are unmistakably insectile as are those in Midway's game. In addition, Bandai's insect characters bear a close resemblance to Midway's, both having brightly lighted eyes and two-toned bodies." The backgrounds were similar (both set in space), and both games had "the same sort of sequential lighting of the stars, creating the same illusion that the characters are moving through space toward the top of the screen." 

Finally, the judge looked at the **game play** of both Galaxians, and found them similar as well. "Bandai game's play and sequence of images is extremely similar to Midway's. Thus, the Bandai aliens fly in a pack and peel off to attack singly or in small groups. As they attack, they invert, as do the Midway creatures. Bandai's aliens also appear to flap their wings as they fly and attempt to collide with the player's ship."  [*Midway v. Bandai*, 546 F.Supp. 125 (D. NJ 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7889409527461466580).

**Procedural Note**: Galaxian v. Galaxian is an order on a "motion for summary judgment." This is a type of early motion where a litigant basically says "my case is so strong that we don't need a trial, and I should win right now." While the judge thought Midway had a strong case for copyright infringement, it was not so strong that Midway could win on a "motion for summary judgment." 

**Takeaway**: Defending a spaceship against swarming alien bad guys is an unprotectable idea. The particular insectile shape of the aliens and their attack patterns and animations are protectable "creative expression." 



<hr class="tall">

## No Infringement: Hyperball v. Rapid Fire (1983)

<img src="/images/copyright/hyperball-v-rapidfire.jpg" class="medium-image">

Williams Electronics made Hyperball, a pinball machine with built-in video game elements. Soon after its release, Bally made Rapid Fire, another pinball machine with video game elements. 

The judge first separated the unprotectable *ideas* from the copyrightable *expression*, and found that "many elements of Hyperball are unprotected. The color, shapes and placements of the targets, ball cannon, grip handles, and indicator lights on the targets, the use of lettered targets to assist the player in scoring, and the shape of the speaker and back box" were functional and non-protectable. In addition, "The colors, shapes and locations of these items have no conceptual significance apart from the role they play in the mechanical operation of the game." 

After separating out the functional elements, the judge compared the remaining copyrightable elements. He started by comparing some specific details: 

 > In viewing the two games solely with reference to their copyrightable features, one is struck by the almost complete absence of substantial similarities. The Hyperball playing field contains three columns of thunderbolts. Rapid Fire has only two columns of aliens carrying shields which pass ammunition to two guns. Nothing like the aliens, shields, ammunition or guns appears on the Hyperball playing field. The thunderbolts and aliens are roughly the same color, but there the similarity ends. Hyperball's thunderbolts point toward an oval area on which the logo "Energy Center" appears. Below that the word "Hyperball" in lighted block letters appears, and below that "Hyperball" is again written in stylized italics. The Rapid Fire playing field contains no oval area but rather variously colored dotted lines that radiate out from a dotted line in the shape of a semicircle, with the words "Force Field" written in a gothic style below the semi-circle. Hyperball has several "bombs" arrayed along the side of the playing field, but none of the various colored dotted lines that are on the Rapid Fire field. 

The judge also compared the overall impression of the two games: 

 > But even more important than these specific dissimilarities is the overall difference in the aesthetic impressions generated by the two games. Hyperball displays thunderbolts; the player's adversary is an impersonal natural force represented by geometric figures. Rapid Fire displays enemy creatures, humanoid in appearance. The Rapid Fire player's enemy is more personalized and not simply a geometric shape. 

The differences between the specific details and between the overall impressions were enough to differentiate Rapid Fire from Hyperball. There was no "substantial similarity" and therefore no copyright infringement. [*Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Bally Manufacturing*, 568 F.Supp. 1274 (ND Ill 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16687668448643130747).

**Takeaway**: A "pinball machine with video game elements" is an unprotectable idea. Rapid Fire copied that idea, as it's allowed to do. The way Hyperball expresses that idea is copyrightable, but Rapid Fire didn't copy the expression.

### No Infringement: Tricky Trapper v. Mouser (1987)

<img src="/images/copyright/tricky-trapper-v-mouser.jpg" class="medium-image">

The copyright analysis in Tricky Trapper v. Mouser is similar to the Asteroids v. Meteors case. IBM's Mouser game was suspiciously similar to Frybarger's Tricky Trapper, so Frybarger sued for copyright infringement. The court noticed several similarities between the two games, but decided that IBM had only copied from the game's *idea*, not its *expression*. The judge specifically identified some of the basic game mechanics as not protectable:

- **Board:** The screen of each game is filled with straight rows of pivot points on a solid colored background. Some of the pivot points are connected by solid lines.

- **Hero:** Both games have a single protagonist that moves vertically and horizontally, and rearranges the solid lines to capture bad guys and earn points. 

- **Bad Guys:** In both games, there are several bad guys to capture. The bad guys move toward the hero, and if they catch him, he dies. 


[*Frybarger v. IBM*, 812 F.2d 525 (9th Cir. 1987)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10064022025067012402). 

*Anyone have a Tricky Trapper screenshot from an Apple II? Both images above are from Mouser. I'd love to know what Tricky Trapper actually looked like.*

# Sports Games

Video Games that simulate existing sports (baseball, soccer karate) get a very thin type of copyright protection. Its a copyright that can stop an identical clones, but not much else.  


- - - 

## No Infringement of Karate Champ (1988)

<img src="/images/copyright/karate-champ-no-copyright-infringement.png" class="medium-image">

"World Karate Championship" (right) is a clone, more or less, of "Karate Champ" (left).  The two games have similar graphics and game play. But unlike Crazy Kong, World Karate Championship was not an identical clone, and unlike KC Munchkin, it copied elements that were patterned on the real-life sport of Karate. 

The court first filtered out the elements that were unprotectable under the "merger" rule. Data East could not copyright the idea of a karate game, nor any game mechanics that necessarily flow from that idea. The unprotectable elements 
 
 > consist of the game procedure, common karate moves, the idea of background scenes, a time element, a referee, computer graphics, and bonus points, result from either constraints inherent in the sport of karate or computer restraints. After careful consideration and viewing of these features, we find that they necessarily follow from the idea of a martial arts karate combat game, or are inseparable from, indispensable to, or even standard treatment of the idea of the karate sport. As such, they are not protectable. [*Data East v. Epyx*, 862 F.2d 204 (9th Cir. 1988)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5941890015361159855).

As a result, there was no copyright infringement.  Epyx copied only the "idea" of a Karate video game, and the non-copyrightable graphics and game mechanics that necessarily flowed from that idea. 

**Takeaway**: There is no copyright protection for common video game karate moves like "upper-lunge punch", "back-foot sweep" and "squatting reverse punch wherein the heel is not on the ground." 


Now let's look at a case involving Street Fighter II - a fighting game with a much looser basis in "reality."  

<hr class="tall">


## No Infringement of Street Fighter II (1994)

<img src="/images/copyright/capcom-v-data-east-no-copyright-infringment-street-fighter.jpg" class="medium-image">

The *creative* elements of video games merit stronger copyright protections than the *non-fiction* elements. Since Street Fighter II was largely based on non-fiction karate (IMO, a debatable premise), the judge gave the game a narrow scope of copyright protection: 

 > ... there is no question that the games involved in those three cases -– Pac-Man, Galaxian and Donkey Kong –- were far more fanciful than many of the elements presented in Street Fighter II.

While Fighter's History (right) copied most of its details and game play from Street Fighter II, it was careful not to copy the creative game elements: 

 > For example, although Guile and Matlok both have spiky hair and wear similar clothing, they are not identical to one another. Guile is a military figure who wears military garb and has a military base as his home stage. Matlok is a “punkrocker” whose characterization is underscored by his tough appearance and “breakdance” type moves. Their magic projectiles, while similar in appearance, are not identical. In keeping with his personality, Matlok throws a spinning compact disc, the form of which is apparent in some video sequences. Guile, on the other hand, throws a Ch’i mental energy ball and shouts “sonic boom” upon its release. This is in keeping with his military persona. 

The judge also excluded any **scènes à faire** elements (i.e., stock elements, cliches, stereotypes) from its copyright analysis. The judge discussed the "vitality bar" and the winner designation. "Neither these individual features, nor their particular compilation in Street Fighter II are original to Capcom. Rather, they are better viewed as unprotectable *scènes à faire*." 

The court also excluded game control sequences from its analysis under the **merger doctrine**:  

 > the control sequences presently at issue cannot be expressed in limitless ways. Rather, the expression of an idea and the underlying idea frequently merge.... The universe of possible joystick combinations is further restricted by the need to have the control sequence emulate the natural movements of the body. To make the game realistic and easy to learn, a developer must have its control sequences follow the natural flow of the fighter’s body. The player must be allowed to manipulate the control panel in an intuitive manner if he or she is going to become proficient at the game. For example, to mirror the physical aspects of throwing an object, the developer would want to choose a joystick/button control sequence that consists of pulling the joystick backwards to follow the arms as they draw back and then moving the joystick forward and hitting a punch button as the character winds up and releases the object. The idea of throwing an object and its expression as reflected in a distinct control sequence will, therefore, coincide. 

Some special moves were unprotectable "scènes à faire", while other special moves were copyrightable creative expression. According to the court, these 7 moves were not protectable:  "(1) Sagat’s 'tiger knee' which is a common kickboxing move; (2) E. Honda’s 'knee bash' which is a common wrestling move; (3) Vega’s mid-air throw which is a basic fight maneuver; (4) Vega’s floor slide which again is a basic fight maneuver; (5) Balrog’s 'dashing punch' which is a simple punch; (6) Zangief’s 'backwards throw'; and (7) Zangief’s 'body leap' both of which are common wrestling moves." Two special moves were protectable: "Chun Li’s head stomp and E. Honda’s 100 hand slap." 

Since Fighter's History only copied (a) non-protectable functional game elements, and (b) non-protectable scènes à faire, it was not infringing the Street Fighter II copyright. [*CapCom v. Data East* (ND CA 1994)](/capcom-v-data-east/). Check out [the appendix](/capcom-v-data-east/#appendix) of the case for a detailed copyright analysis of the fighters, [special moves](/various-special-moves) and combos. 

**Takeaway**: Intuitive game controls are "functional" game elements and therefore not copyrightable. Common wrestling moves are not copyrightable, but magical moves (with no basis in reality) are protectable creative expression. Original video game characters are copyrightable, but stereotypes are not.

**Comment**: I've never played Fighter's History, but it looks like a god damn Street Fighter II ripoff. I'd call it copyright infringement.

## Trackball Control Not Copyrightable: Golden Tee Golf (2005)

<img src="/images/copyright/goldentee-v-pga-tour-no-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image" >

Incredible Technologies made the popular Golden Tee arcade game (left). Virtual Technologies made PGA Tour (right) with the explicit purpose of cloning Golden Tee. The games and controls were very similar: 

 > The size and shape of PGA Tour Golf's control panel, and the placement of its trackball and buttons, are nearly identical to those of Golden Tee. The "shot shaping" choices are depicted in a similar way and in the same sequence. Although the software on the two games is dissimilar, both allow a player to simulate a straight shot, a fade, a slice, a draw, a hook, etc. by the direction in which the trackball is rolled back and pushed forward. [*Incredible Technologies v. Virtual Technologies*, 400 F. 3d 1007 (7th Cir. 2005)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10633608556007842361). 

Before comparing the two golf games, the court filtered out the standard golf themes under the *scènes à faire* doctrine: 

 > In presenting a realistic video golf game, one would, by definition, need golf courses, clubs, a selection menu, a golfer, a wind meter, etc. Sand traps and water hazards are a fact of life for golfers, real and virtual. The menu screens are standard to the video arcade game format, as are prompts showing the distance remaining to the hole. As such, the video display is afforded protection only from virtually identical copying. [*Incredible Tech. v. Virtual Tech.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10633608556007842361). 

Condescending golf announcers are apparently *scènes à faire*. Any golf game can use condescending announcers, but they can't copy the identical condescending phrases. Fortunately for PGA Tour, it didn't copy the phrases: 

> "the fairway would be over there" and "I don't think that's going to help a whole lot" in PGA Tour versus "That can only hurt," "You've got to be kidding," and "You can lead a ball to water but ..." from the Golden Tee announcers. [*Incredible Tech. v. Virtual Tech.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10633608556007842361).

Useful articles, like the trackball control, are not copyrightable. A useful article is defined in the copyright act as "an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information." The trackball system of operating the game was considered a useful article, and therefore not subject to copyright protection.

**Takeaway**: Video game controls (like a trackball) and instructions are entitled to very little, if any, copyright protection.

## Interlude: Early Video Game Cases Gave Designers More Leeway to Copy Because Primitive Technology Limited their Design Options. 

The technical limitations of early video games systems didn't give game designers many pixels to work with. If one character looked like another, was it because of copying, or just because designers were limited to sprites using only a handful of pixels and colors? In the early days of video games, perhaps spaceships could only be expressed as blocky little triangles. As a result, early designers were given more leeway to copy from previous games. This is related to the "merger doctrine." 

 > ... most of these similarities are inevitable, given the requirements of the idea of a game involving a spaceship combatting space rocks and given the technical demands of the medium of a video game. [*Atari v. Amusement World*, 547 F.Supp. 222 (D. Md. 1981)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6441518363892064579).

 > "Furthermore, the mere indispensable expression of these ideas, based on the technical requirements of the videogame medium, may be protected only against virtually identical copying." [*Frybarger v. IBM*, 812 F.2d 525 (9th Cir. 1987)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10064022025067012402)(*Tricky Trapper v. Mouser*). 

The judge was basically saying that because video game technology was so crappy back then, changing just a few pixels would be enough to avoid copyright infringement. 

Video game technology has obviously advanced since Mouser, and so we need to be careful when relying on old video game cases.  With so many more design options available, any similarities between games should be viewed with greater suspicion.

## Games Can Infringe Movies, But Dead Rising Didn't (2008)

<img src="/images/copyright/dawn-of-the-dead-v-dead-rising-no-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image">

Capcom's *Dead Rising* game took inspiration from George Romero's 1979 zombie classic *Dawn of the Dead*. In its copyright analysis, the judge noted several similarities. In both works: (1) the story kicks off with a helicopter ride to a rural mall infested with zombies; (2) the mall has a gun shop; and (3) propane tanks and chainsaws are used in creative ways to kill zombies. Both works also parody rampant consumerism and critique sensational journalism. 

Before comparing the game to the original movie, the court filtered out the unprotectable *scènes à faire* (i.e., stock zombie elements). Unfortunately for Romero's Dawn of the Dead, all of the similarities were "driven by the wholly unprotectable concept of humans battling zombies in a mall during a zombie outbreak." Since Capcom's video game only copied unprotectable ideas, there was no copyright infringement. [*Capcom v. MKR Group*, 2008 WL 4661479 (N.D. Cal. 2008)](/capcom-v-mkr-2008/).

**Takeaway**: Using chainsaws to kill zombies is *scènes à faire*. It's cliche, not copyrightable expression.

## Tetris Infringed by Mino (2012)

<img src="/images/copyright/tetris-v-mino-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image" >

Soon after college, Desiree Golden started a video game company called Xio Interactive. Before releasing Mino, a Tetris clone for iOS (right), she did some copyright research: 

 > Before releasing its product, Xio researched copyright law, both through its own independent studying and based on advice of counsel... Based on this research, Xio believed it could freely copy any part of Tetris that was based on a "rule of the game" or that Xio viewed as being functional to the game. 

She understood the basic rules of copyright law, and that the *idea* of a falling-block puzzle game is not part of the Tetris copyright. However, when she tried to draw the line between the "idea" of Tetris and its protectable creative expression, she gave herself too much leeway to copy from the original game. 

Here's how the Judge identified the unprotectable *idea* of Tetris: 

 > Tetris is a puzzle game where a user manipulates pieces composed of square blocks, each made into a different geometric shape, that fall from the top of the game board to the bottom where the pieces accumulate. The user is given a new piece after the current one reaches the bottom of the available game space. While a piece is falling, the user rotates it in order to fit it in with the accumulated pieces. The object of the puzzle is to fill all spaces along a horizontal line. If that is accomplished, the line is erased, points are earned, and more of the game board is available for play. But if the pieces accumulate and reach the top of the screen, then the game is over. These then are the general, abstract ideas underlying Tetris and cannot be protected by copyright nor can expressive elements that are inseparable from them. 

These basic *ideas* involved in a falling-block puzzle game were not protectable. However, the *creative expression* of those ideas as Tetris was protectable. The selection of the 7 basic Tetris shapes was protectable expression. The style of the pieces and the way they move through space was protectable creative expression: 

 > The style, design, shape, and movement of the pieces are expression; they are not part of the ideas, rules, or functions of the game nor are they essential or inseparable from the ideas, rules, or functions of the game.  

Since Mino copied the exact same 7 Tetris shapes, the same board dimensions (10 x 20) and the way the shapes moved through the board, it infringed the Tetris copyright. [*Tetris v. Xio Interactive*, 863 F.Supp.2d 394 (D. NJ 2012)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18064882260025243346).

**Takeaway**: Copyright infringement law is not easy. Desiree Golden seems like a smart young woman who did good research, and still got it wrong.

## Infringement in Triple Town v. Yeti Town (2012)

<img src="/images/copyright/tripletown-v-yeti-town-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image">

Spry Fox made Triple Town (left), LolApp made Yeti Town (right). Spry Fox noticed some suspicious similarities, and sued for copyright infringement.  As usual, the copyright analysis starts by filtering out the unprotectable ideas: 

> The idea underlying Triple Town is that of a hierarchical matching game, one in which players create objects that are higher in the hierarchy by matching three objects that are lower in the hierarchy. Frustrating the player’s efforts are antagonist objects; aiding the player are objects that destroy unwanted or ill-placed objects. Spry Fox’s copyright gives it no monopoly over this idea. 

In addition to the unprotectable idea, Triple Town used some unprotectable *scènes à faire*. The use of points and “coins” to reward a player’s progress is standard. The display of visual game tips in the margins of the game screen is also standard. Finally, the notion of an in-game marketplace where the player can redeem coins for game advantages is standard.

The court also filtered out unprotectable game mechanics. Using a six-by-six game grid is not an expressive choice. "A grid that is too small would make the game trivial; a grid that  is too large would make it pointless." Similarly, the pricing structure in Triple Town’s marketplace, along with its strategic limits on how many advantages a player can purchase, are functional considerations. 

Looking at the remaining protectable game elements, the court decided they were probably infringing. 

 > In Triple Town, the antagonist is a bear. In Yeti Town, the antagonist is a yeti... bears and yetis are both wild creatures....
 
 > The object hierarchy is similar. Progressing from grass to bush to tree to hut is similar to progressing from sapling to tree to tent to cabin. Perhaps more importantly, the object hierarchy coupled with the depiction of the field of play comprise a setting and theme that is similar to Triple Town’s.
 
The judge also defers to the opinion of video game bloggers: "The bloggers, who are ordinary observers of video games, find Yeti Town and Triple Town to be substantially similar."  [*Spry Fox v. LolApps* (WD WA 2012)](/spry-fox-v-lolapps-2012/). 

In any event, this case was settled before a final decision was reached. The settlement details are confidential, but Yeti Town is no longer available in the app store. 

**Takeaway**: Copyright protections for video game mechanics seem to be expanding. This is bad news for cloners. Also, video game bloggers can apparently make a difference in copyright cases.

## Bang! Role Playing Card Game Copyrightable (2014)

<img src="/images/copyright/bang-v-lotk-copyright.jpg" class="translucent">


A recent case involving non-video games further solidifies the idea that game mechanics can be copyrightable.  DaVinci made the original "Bang!" game (left), and  accused Ziko of copyright infringement for its "Legend of the Three Kingdoms" game (right). The parties agreed that the game *mechanics* were identical, but the game *art* was entirely different: 

> The parties agree that Bang! and LOTK have nearly identical rules for playing the game. The setting, artwork, and written instructions are substantially different. LOTK is 're-set in ancient China instead of the wild-west.' The 'ancient Chinese' themed roles in LOTK (the Monarch, Minister, Rebel, and Turncoat) fulfill the same roles as the Sheriff, Deputy, Outlaw, and Renegade in Bang!. 

Drawing on video game cases, the judge decided that the Bang! *game rules* were not copyrightable. "The similar uses of life points, distance between players, action cards, and rewards and punishments do not constitute actionable copying." The character *roles*, unlike game rules, were copyrightable: 

 > The players in both games play virtually identical roles. ... such roles and their expression are not merely rules that prescribe what the players may do; the roles and their expression also describe how the players may do it. If the roles describe the content of the players' interactions in ways that are sufficiently original or creative to merit copyright protection, players' roles can be protectable. 
 
The Bang! characters and capabilities were also copyrightable: 

 > the corresponding characters in the two games have substantially similar capabilities. Each character card in both games has a name, picture, and a description of the character's capabilities and life points. The defendants allegedly copied these capabilities and life points, simply changing the names and artwork. The questions are whether these character elements are protected and whether translating the Bang! characters from a Wild West to an ancient China theme infringes that protection.

 > Given the similarities between the attributes of the characters in Bang! and in LOTK, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the characters of the two games are substantially similar despite the transposition and translation from the Wild-West theme of Bang! to the ancient China theme of LOTK.

The judge contrasted the fictional Bang! game with the realistic golf simulation case. If two golf simulation games are similar, its probably because both games are copying from the sport of golf. If two fictional role playing games are similar, the second may have copied from the first: 

 > There is a limited number of ways for the game designer to show a golfer, a course, a swing, and the ultimate goal: putting the ball in the hole. Such limits do not apply to role-playing games like Bang!. There are nearly infinite ways of expressing the concepts of player elimination or a contest between authorities and their opponents. Instead of choosing a different manner of expressing these concepts, the defendants copied into LOTK protectable elements of DaVinci's original and creative expression in Bang!
 
For context, this is a very early decision in the case. The judge isn't answering the question of whether there is copyright infringement. He is answering the question of whether the plaintiff's copyright claims are *so weak* they can be thrown out on a preliminary "motion to dismiss." The answer was that the copyright claims were plausible, and so they survived the preliminary motion to dismiss. [*Da Vinci v. Ziko Games* (SD Texas 2014)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5597788239119337082)

The case is ongoing (as of October 2014), so we will keep watching.

## Conclusion

Video game copyright cases turn on whether the clone copied "ideas" (tolerated) or "creative" elements (verboten). Before looking for similarities between the clone and the original, we need to mentally "filter out" the unprotectable game elements using several different techniques: 

**Idea-Expression Dichotomy**.  First we filter out the unprotectable "ideas" from the protectable expression. 

- The *idea* of a maze-chase game can't be copyrighted.  
- The *expression* of a chomping gobbler antagonized by colorful ghosts can be protected by copyright.
- The *idea* of a karate style fighting game can't be copyrighted. 
- The *expression* of E. Honda’s "100 hand slap" can be protected by copyright.

**Merger Rule**. If there is only one way to express a particular idea, then idea and expression "merge", and neither will be copyrightable. 

**Realistic Simulations**. The more a game simulates real life, the less copyright protection it will receive. The more creative and abstract the game elements, the stronger the copyright protection. 

**Useful Articles**. Copyright does not “extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation...” 17 USC § 102(b). Game controls like a trackball are unprotectable as useful articles or "methods of operation." 

**Scènes à Faire**. Copyright doesn't protect cliches, stereotypes, stock characters or standard treatments. For example, Pac-Man's dots, Street Fighters vitality bar, and zombie-chainsaw-decapitations are all unprotectable *scènes à faire*. 

The copyright infringement analysis is more an art than a science. The line between creative expression and unprotectable ideas is famously elusive. As Judge Learned Hand (real name) put it, "Nobody has ever been able to fix that boundary, and nobody ever can." [*Nichols v. Universal*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14991934121439658064).

# How to Prepare for the Clones

### Copyright Registration. 

First, register the US copyright to your games. It's not particularly expensive. I've collected the Copyright Office's [recent guidance on video game copyright registration here](/video-game-copyright-registration/). Register several copyrights covering several different aspects of your game, including the code itself and any particularly interesting characters or art. Think about the creative expression in your game, and try to hone in on these creative aspects when filing for a copyright. 

You can even register copyrights before you publish your game, to avoid a  [Ridiculous Fishing](http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/5/3461458/cloning-case-files-vlambeer) scenario, where the clone launches *before* the original. 

### Trademark Registration. 

Second, register the US Trademark in the name of your game. This is more expensive, but it provides broader rights. It prevents other people from making a similar game under a *similar title*. If you own the registered trademark, you can at least force cloners to think up a different name. 

The trademark registration should describe your game play in some detail in its "description of goods and services." A similar-sounding name along side an exact match of the goods and services can be powerful clone deterrent. 

We discuss [trademark law in detail](/trademark-basics/), and offer a [DIY walkthrough of the trademark registration process](http://adlervermillion.com/how-to-trademark-part-2-registration-guide/). Our [trademark services are summarized here](/trademark-services/). 

### Trade Dress

A trademark registration for the game's "trade dress" can also be useful. Trade Dress can protects a product's packaging as well as a product's unique-and-non-functional shape or appearance.  Tetris was able to leverage it's trade dress in its case against Mino. However, trade dress is a tricky area of law, and should be approached with caution. 

<img src="/images/trademark/tetris-trade-dress-registration.png" class="translucent">

### Patents

Patents are the most expensive option, but provide the most valuable protection. Budget about $8,000 for a patent application. Patents are slow. They take about 3 years to issue on average. If you pay extra to expedite the filing, a patent can issue in just under 1 year. 

For small mobile games, patents may be too expensive. However, if you are building a truly new and innovative game, a small patent portfolio may still be a worthwhile investment. We discuss [patent law here](/patent-basics), and our [patent services here](/patent-services).

<img src="/images/patent-drawings/pong-patent-1972.png">



### Enforcement and Public Relations

While clones can be infuriating, it's important to remember that aggressive legal tactics can backfire. Consider a public relations campaign before, or in tandem with, any legal action. A carefully worded copyright infringement letter from a lawyer can be powerful, especially when it makes you look like the reasonable party. The letter should accurately describe the law and similarities between the games, and politely (but firmly) demand that the clone be removed from the app store. 

The first legal action for apps may involve sending a DMCA takedown notice to the appropriate app store. For iOS, You can submit a claim through Apple's [iTunes Content Dispute](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appstorenotices/) form. For Android, submit through Google's [Legal Removal Requests](https://support.google.com/legal) page.

# Copyright Requires Only a "Modicum of Creativity" 

Copyright only protects works of "creative authorship." How creative? Any modicum of creativity will suffice. As one court put it, just the "taint of originality" is enough.  Even simple games like Breakout and video poker meet the minimum creativity requirements for a copyright.  


## Even Simple Video Games are Copyrightable: Breakout (1992)

<img src="/images/copyright/atari-breakout-copyrightable-subject-matter-ginsburg-arkanoid.jpg" class="medium-image">

Atari, maker of "Breakout" (left) was unhappy with Romstar's "Arkanoid" game (right). But before anyone can sue for copyright infringement, they need a  *registered copyright.* While Atari had applied for its Breakout copyright registration, the Copyright Office refused to grant it. The Copyright Office dismissed Breakout as a mere collection of functional rules, basic shapes and colors, and lacking any creative authorship. Atari appealed the matter to a young Ruth Bader-Ginsburg (at the time, a 59 year old appellate judge in D.C.). 

Ruth Bader-Ginsburg appreciated the creativity involved in designing video games. While simple shapes and colors are unprotectable, Atari's *selection and arrangement* of simple shapes were copyrightable, especially because they were paired with creative sound effects. And while game mechanics based on pure physics are public domain, the Breakout game mechanics are governed by *creative physics*: 
 
 > The ball's path in Breakout varies depending on which of four sections of the paddle it hits. Its trajectory does not follow from the laws of physics. [*Atari v. Oman*, 979 F.2d 242 (DC CA 1992)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11202168367195629653).

The representation of game objects were also creative design choices worthy of copyright protection.
 
 > The abstract representation in Breakout is neither an "obvious" nor an "inevitable" choice. Nor is the coordination of a square "ball" and a rectangular shrinking paddle a "time-honored" or "conventional" combination. The same may be said of the choice of colors, the placement and design of the scores, the changes in speed, the use of sounds, and the synchronized graphics and sounds which accompany the ball's bounces behind the wall. [*Atari v. Oman*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11202168367195629653) (edited for length).

Since Breakout includes the types of creative expression that merits copyright protection, Judge Ginsburg cajoled the Copyright Office into approving Atari's copyright registration. (In fact, this was the second time Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the Copyright Office to register the Breakout copyright. The first was in [*Atari v. Oman*, 888 F. 2d 878 (DC CA 1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16631771208846018552)). 


**Takeaway**: The arrangement of simple shapes and colors in a video game, even a simple video game, is the type of *creative expression* that merits copyright protection. 

**Takeaway**: Game-mechanics based in fictional physics are more creative than games based in real-world physics (like realistic sports games), and therefore receive greater copyright protection.

## No Infringement: Sharpshooter v. Police Trainer 2

<img src="/images/copyright/police-trainer-2-title.jpg" class="medium-image">

Boyer designed the game "Sharpshooter" and then recognized some similarities in Team Play's "Police Trainer 2." He accused Team play of copyright infringement, specifically claiming that Police Trainer 2 stole: (1) a shooting challenge in which targets float out of a cylindrical opening in the floor; (2) a shooting challenge in which targets are randomly arranged, and a player must remember which are which and only shoot certain targets; (3) a shooting challenge in which targets randomly "pop" out of cylindrical openings for the player to shoot; and (4) silver iconic objects that appear next to each completed challenge as a progress indicator.

Sadly for Boyer, the judge decided that all 4 items of "allegedly misappropriated graphical art" were either uncopyrightable ideas or *scene a faire*. "In each instance, they are subject to copyright protection only from virtually identical copying." [*Team Play v. Boyer*, 391 F. Supp. 2d 695 (ND Ill 2005)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3622100013857292984). 

In her comparison, the judge decided that team play's copying wasn't that type of "identical copying" that would trigger infringement. 

1. Police Trainer 2's "Balloons" Challenge v. Sharpshooter's "Floating Balls" Challenge

2. Police Trainer's "Memory" Challenge v. Sharpshooter's "Memory" Challenge"

3. Police Trainer's "Whack the Criminal" v. Sharpshooter's "Shoot the Alien"

4. Police Trainer's Icons in "Select Rank Exam" v. Sharpshooter's Icons in "Ultimate Challenge"

[Note: Need images for these comparisons. The copies in the opinion are just black photocopied blobs.]
