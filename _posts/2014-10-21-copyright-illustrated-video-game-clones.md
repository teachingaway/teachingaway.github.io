Copying Chun Li's 'head stomp' would be stealing, but copying Sagat’s 'tiger knee' would just be borrowing inspiration. In 2012, one court decided that copying the size of the Tetris game board (10x20) was infringement, but four months later, a different court decided that copying the size of the Triple Town game board (6x6) was allowed. Copyright infringement cases can seem arbitrary. But looking at a dozen cases over 3 decades, I think we can find *some* method to the madness.

## Idea vs. Expression 

Copyright law allows — even encourages — copying ideas. No one can monopolize an idea. What copyright law *prohibits* is copying the  *original creative expression* of an idea. Since video games are collections of both ideas and expressions, the question of copyright infringement turns on whether the cloner copied any “creative expression” from the original game. 

To oversimplify, you can think about expression vs. idea as game vs. genre. You can copyright the game *Super Mario Brothers*, but not the *idea* of a side-scrolling platformer.  *Doom* can be copyrighted, but not the *idea* of a first-person shooter. Kingdom Rush yes, tower defense no. Games vs. genres is a useful starting point, but it's a blunt instrument. Reasonable people can disagree about how narrowly to define the genre or sub-genre that encompasses the public-domain game elements. 

You should be able to encapsulate the "idea" of a video game in a few sentences. Anything more than that, and you're probably starting to describe the copyrightable "expression."  Here are some examples judges describing the unprotectable "idea" behind some famous video games: 

- **Idea of Galaxian**: "an outer space video game in which the player controls a rocket ship defending itself against a swarm of computer-controlled attacking aliens who attempt to bomb and collide with the player’s ship."

- **Idea of Asteroids**: "a video game in which the player commands a spaceship through a barrage of space rocks and enemy spaceships." 

- **Idea of Pac-Man**: "a maze-chase game in which the player scores points by guiding a central figure through various passageways of a maze and at the same time avoiding collision with certain opponents or pursuit figures which move independently about the maze. Under certain conditions, the central figure may temporarily become empowered to chase and overtake the opponents, thereby scoring bonus points." 

- **Idea of Karate Champ**: "a martial arts karate combat game conducted between two combatants, and presided over by a referee, all of which are represented by visual images, and providing a method of scoring accomplished by full and half point scores for each player, and utilizing dots to depict full point scores and half point scores." 

- **Idea of Tetris**: "Tetris is a puzzle game where a user manipulates pieces composed of square blocks, each made into a different geometric shape, that fall from the top of the game board to the bottom where the pieces accumulate. ... The object of the puzzle is to fill all spaces along a horizontal line. If that is accomplished, the line is erased, points are earned, and more of the game board is available for play. But if the pieces accumulate and reach the top of the screen, then the game is over." 

- **Idea of Triple Town**: "a hierarchical matching game... in which players create objects that are higher in the hierarchy by matching three objects that are lower in the hierarchy. Frustrating the player’s efforts are antagonist objects; aiding the player are objects that destroy unwanted or ill-placed objects." 

We'll need a scalpel to surgically dissect video games and separate their public-domain ideas from their copyrighted expression. And since examples are more fun than theory, so let’s start with a case about Atari’s Breakout. It's not really a case about *Breakout* vs. *Arkanoid*, it's a case about whether a simple video game like *Breakout* has any protectable “creative expression” at all.

<hr class="tall">

# Copyright Require's a "Modicum of Creativity." 

Copyright only protects works of "creative authorship." How creative? Any modicum of creativity will suffice. As one court put it, just the "taint of originality" is enough.  Even simple games like Breakout and video poker meet the minimum creativity requirements for a copyright.  


## Even Simple Video Games are Copyrightable: Breakout (1992)

<img src="/images/copyright/atari-breakout-copyrightable-subject-matter-ginsburg-arkanoid.jpg" class="medium-image">

Atari, maker of "Breakout" (left) was unhappy with Romstar's "Arkanoid" game (right). But before anyone can sue for copyright infringement, they need a  *registered copyright.* While Atari had applied for its Breakout copyright registration, the Copyright Office refused to grant it. The Copyright Office dismissed Breakout as a mere collection of functional rules, basic shapes and colors, and lacking any creative authorship. Atari appealed the matter to a young Ruth Bader-Ginsburg (at the time, a 59 year old appellate judge in D.C.). 

Ruth Bader-Ginsburg appreciated the creativity involved in designing video games. While simple shapes and colors are unprotectable, Atari's *selection and arrangement* of simple shapes were copyrightable, especially because they were paired with creative sound effects. And while game mechanics based on pure physics are public domain, the Breakout game mechanics are governed by *creative physics*: 
 
 > The ball's path in Breakout varies depending on which of four sections of the paddle it hits. Its trajectory does not follow from the laws of physics. [*Atari v. Oman*, 979 F.2d 242 (DC CA 1992)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11202168367195629653).

The representation of game objects were also creative design choices worthy of copyright protection.
 
 > The abstract representation in Breakout is neither an "obvious" nor an "inevitable" choice. Nor is the coordination of a square "ball" and a rectangular shrinking paddle a "time-honored" or "conventional" combination. The same may be said of the choice of colors, the placement and design of the scores, the changes in speed, the use of sounds, and the synchronized graphics and sounds which accompany the ball's bounces behind the wall. [*Atari v. Oman*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11202168367195629653) (edited for length).

Since Breakout includes the types of creative expression that merits copyright protection, Judge Ginsburg cajoled the Copyright Office into approving Atari's copyright registration. (In fact, this was the second time Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the Copyright Office to register the Breakout copyright. The first was in [*Atari v. Oman*, 888 F. 2d 878 (DC CA 1989)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16631771208846018552)). 


**Takeaway**: The arrangement of simple shapes and colors in a video game, even a simple video game, is the type of *creative expression* that merits copyright protection. 

**Takeaway**: Game-mechanics based in fictional physics are more creative than games based in real-world physics (like realistic sports games), and therefore receive greater copyright protection.

# Identical Cloning is Always Infringement

Selling an identical clone is going to be copyright infringement. This is a no-brainer. 

<hr class="tall">

## Crazy Kong: Crazy Infringement (1982)

<img src="/images/copyright/donkey-kong-v-crazy-kong-clone-copyright-infringement.png" class="medium-image">

Elcon made a straight-up Donkey Kong clone called "Crazy Kong." Crazy Kong "embodies audio-video material, including the characters on the screen and the sound, that is virtually identical" to Donkey Kong. [*Nintendo v. Elcon*, 564 F. Supp. 937 (ED Mich 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14413211357527714092). Crazy Kong didn't just copy game mechanics or unprotectable ideas. Crazy Kong copied every detail. Predictably, this is copyright infringement. It always is: 

- "Puck Man", an identical clone of Pac-Man, was likewise found to be copyright infringement in [*Midway v. Artic*, 704 F.2d 1009 (7th Cir. 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3345463532258240978). Artic just copied the name “Puck Man” from the original Japanese version of the game. [*Midway v. Artic*, 547 F.Supp. 999 (ND Ill 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3162513435280413681).
- "Space Defense", an identical clone of "Defender" was copyright infringement in [*Williams Electronics v. Artic International,* 685 F. 2d 870 (3rd Cir. 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8334646367831709790). 
- "Scramble", an identical clone of "Scramble" was copyright infringement in [*Stern Electronics v. Kaufman*, 669 F.2d 852 (2nd Cir. 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7204019639108685629). 

**Takeaway**: Identical cloning is copyright infringement. 

<hr class="tall">


## The Taint of Originality: Hi-Lo Double Up Joker Poker (1986)

<img src="/images/copyright/kramer-v-andrews-joker-poker.jpg" class="medium-image" >

Kramer made *Hi-Lo Double Up Joker Poker*. Drew's Distributing and Lynch Enterprises made *Joker Poker 54* soon afterwards. Kramer sued for copyright infringement. 

[*Kramer Manufacturing v. Andrews*, 783 F. 2d 421 (4th Cir. 1986)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5294172034546412150).

The judge first decided that the plaintiff's game, though similar to standard poker, demonstrated more than a mere "taint of originality." (Better known as the "modicum of creativity" standard).

Since Plaintiff's poker video game was so similar to standard poker, it was entitled to a very narrow type of copyright protection. However, a near identical clone would still be infringing. 

The defendant made some superficial changes to the game, changing the "configuration of the board that holds the ROMS, changing some words in the audiovisual display, and by changing the design on some of the cards. Specifically, he inserted the name 'Lynch Enterprises' in the attract mode, inserted the insignia 'LE' on the back of the playing cards, and changed some of the wording in the attract and play modes." [*Kramer Manufacturing v. Andrews*, 783 F. 2d 421 (4th Cir. 1986)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5294172034546412150)

These minor changes were not enough to save Drews/Lynch 
, and that's what the defendant produced. The defendant copied nearly every detail, right down to the easter egg: 

> Kramer Manufacturing embedded in its program a hidden legend that would appear only when the game's buttons were pressed in an abnormal sequence. The defendants' program shows that the legend is included in its copy. [*Kramer Manufacturing v. Andrews*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5294172034546412150).


Since Drew copied everything down to the copyright traps, the judge predictably found the games to be "virtually identical." And while there were some differences, the dissimilarities "appear quite obviously to be the result of a studied effort to make minor distinctions between the two" games. The defendant was trying "to appropriate the plaintiff's design either outright or by frivolous variation." [*Kramer Manufacturing v. Andrews*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5294172034546412150).

**Pro tip:** If you're pirating someone else's game, don't put a pirate on your promo material. 

- - - 

The more interesting copyright cases involve games that make at least a minimal effort to differentiate themselves from the originals. To explore these cases, you will need a bit of legalese. Remember that copyright protects creative expression, but not ideas. Lawyers call this the **idea/expression dichotomy.** The policy of free ideas is so powerful that if the idea and its expression are inseparable, then the expression must also remain free. This is the **merger rule**. Also, copyright does not protect cliches. This is the **scènes à faire** doctrine. 

<hr class="tall">


## No Infringement: Asteroids v. Meteors (1981) 

<img src="/images/copyright/asteroids-v-meteors.jpg" class="medium-image">

*"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1."* -- C3PO

Atari made the original Asteroids game. Amusement World made a knockoff called Meteors. The judge enumerated 22 similarities and decided that the "defendants based their game on plaintiff's copyrighted game; to put it bluntly, defendants took plaintiff's idea. However, the copyright laws do not prohibit this." [*Atari v. Amusement World*, 547 F.Supp. 222 (D.Md. 1981)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6441518363892064579).

The 22 similarities involved the graphics, game mechanics and sound. According to the judge, they were all part of the unprotectable "idea" of a "a video game in which a player fights his way through space rocks and enemy spaceships." [*Atari v. Amusement World*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6441518363892064579).

The court also noted 9 differences, which seem to mainly involve more advanced graphics. Here are a few examples:  

- Meteors is in color, while Asteroids is in black and white.

- The symbols for rocks and spaceships in Meteors are shaded to appear three-dimensional, unlike the flat, schematic figures in Asteroids.

- At the beginning of Meteors, the player's spaceship is shown blasting off the earth, whereas "Asteroids" begins with the player's spaceship in outer space.

- The player's spaceship in Meteors fires faster and can fire continuously, unlike the player's spaceship in Asteroids, which can fire only bursts of projectiles.

- In Meteors, after the player's spaceship is destroyed, when the new spaceship appears on the screen, the game resumes at the same pace as immediately before the last ship was destroyed; in Asteroids the game resumes at a slower pace.

These changes were enough. "Defendants used plaintiff's idea and those portions of plaintiff's expression that were inextricably linked to that idea. The remainder of defendants' expression is different from plaintiff's expression. Therefore, the Court finds that defendants' Meteors game is not substantially similar to and is not an infringing copy of plaintiff's Asteroids game." [*Atari v. Amusement World*, 547 F.Supp. 222 (D.Md. 1981)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6441518363892064579).

### No Infringement: Tricky Trapper v. Mouser (1987)

<img src="/images/copyright/tricky-trapper-v-mouser.jpg" class="medium-image">

The copyright analysis in Tricky Trapper v. Mouser is similar to the Asteroids v. Meteors case. IBM's Mouser game was suspiciously similar to Frybarger's Tricky Trapper, so Frybarger sued for copyright infringement. The court noticed several similarities between the two games, but decided the similarities were part of the game's *idea*, not it's *expression*. [*Frybarger v. IBM*, 812 F.2d 525 (9th Cir. 1987)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10064022025067012402). The judge specifically identified some of the basic game mechanics as not protectable:

- **Board:** The screen of each game is filled with straight rows of pivot points on a solid colored background. Some of the pivot points are connected by solid lines.

- **Hero:** Both games have a single protagonist that moves vertically and horizontally, and rearranges the solid lines to capture bad guys and earn points. 

- **Bad Guys:** In both games, there are several bad guys to capture. The bad guys move toward the hero, and if they catch him, he dies. 

*Anyone have a Tricky Trapper screenshot from an Apple II? Both images above are from Mouser. I'd love to know what Tricky Trapper actually looked like.* 

<hr class="tall">

## Galaxian v. Galaxian: Porting is Infringement (1982)


<img src="/images/copyright/midway-galaxian-v-bandai-galaxian.jpg" class="medium-image">


Midway made the arcade game *Pac-Man*, and Bandai cloned it with the handheld *Packri Monster*. Midway made the arcade game *Galaxian*, and Bandai cloned it with a handheld game called... *Galaxian*. Let's talk about the Galaxian copyright. 

In his copyright analysis, the judge first separated the unprotectable *idea* of the Galaxian game from its expression. 

> Here, the idea of Midway's Galaxian is relatively simple and easily expressed: it is an outer space video game in which the player controls a rocket ship defending itself against a swarm of computer-controlled attacking aliens who attempt to bomb and collide with the player's ship. With the idea of Midway's Galaxian thus identified, it is clear that Midway's copyright does not in the least preclude the creation of an entire universe of other space video games (e.g., Space Invaders) based on the same, unprotected idea. It is also clear that, in expressing its version of the game idea, there was no necessity for Bandai to mimic Midway's expression of this idea which involves such elements as the particular insectile shape of the aliens, their movements, and the musical theme. [*Midway v. Bandai*, 546 F.Supp. 125 (D. NJ 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7889409527461466580). 

After filtering out the unprotectable idea, the judge then compared the copyrightable expression. He decided that the "*musical* themes of the two Galaxian games are fundamentally identical."  [*Midway v. Bandai*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7889409527461466580). Likewise, the *alien enemies* were similar. "The Bandai aliens are unmistakably insectile as are those in Midway's game. In addition, Bandai's insect characters bear a close resemblance to Midway's, both having brightly lighted eyes and two-toned bodies." The backgrounds were similar (both set in space), and both games had "the same sort of sequential lighting of the stars, creating the same illusion that the characters are moving through space toward the top of the screen."  [*Midway v. Bandai*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7889409527461466580). 

Finally, the court looked at the game play of both Galaxians, and found them similar as well. "Bandai game's play and sequence of images is extremely similar to Midway's. Thus, the Bandai aliens fly in a pack and peel off to attack singly or in small groups. As they attack, they invert, as do the Midway creatures. Bandai's aliens also appear to flap their wings as they fly and attempt to collide with the player's ship." [*Midway v. Bandai*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7889409527461466580). 

The judge did not actually decide the copyright issue in this case, but from his language, he seemed inclined to find infringement. 


<hr class="tall">

## No Infringement: Hyperball v. Rapid Fire (1983)

<img src="/images/copyright/hyperball-v-rapidfire.jpg" class="medium-image">

Williams Electronics made Hyperball, a pinball machine with built-in video game elements. Soon after its release, Bally made Rapid Fire, another pinball machine with video game elements. 

In separating the unprotectable *ideas* from the copyrightable *expression*, the judge decided that, "many elements of Hyperball are unprotected. The color, shapes and placements of the targets, ball cannon, grip handles, and indicator lights on the targets, the use of lettered targets to assist the player in scoring, and the shape of the speaker and back box" were functional and non-protectable. In addition, "The colors, shapes and locations of these items have no conceptual significance apart from the role they play in the mechanical operation of the game." [*Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Bally Manufacturing*, 568 F.Supp. 1274 (ND Ill 1983)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16687668448643130747).

After separating out the functional elements, the judge compared the remaining copyrightable elements, and determined that there was no similarity, and therefore no copyright infringement. 

 > In viewing the two games solely with reference to their copyrightable features, one is struck by the almost complete absence of substantial similarities. The Hyperball playing field contains three columns of thunderbolts. Rapid Fire has only two columns of aliens carrying shields which pass ammunition to two guns. Nothing like the aliens, shields, ammunition or guns appears on the Hyperball playing field. The thunderbolts and aliens are roughly the same color, but there the similarity ends. Hyperball's thunderbolts point toward an oval area on which the logo "Energy Center" appears. Below that the word "Hyperball" in lighted block letters appears, and below that "Hyperball" is again written in stylized italics. The Rapid Fire playing field contains no oval area but rather variously colored dotted lines that radiate out from a dotted line in the shape of a semicircle, with the words "Force Field" written in a gothic style below the semi-circle. Hyperball has several "bombs" arrayed along the side of the playing field, but none of the various colored dotted lines that are on the Rapid Fire field. But even more important than these specific dissimilarities is the overall difference in the aesthetic impressions generated by the two games. Hyperball displays thunderbolts; the player's adversary is an impersonal natural force represented by geometric figures. Rapid Fire displays enemy creatures, humanoid in appearance. The Rapid Fire player's enemy is more personalized and not simply a geometric shape. [*Williams Electronics, Inc. v. Bally Manufacturing*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16687668448643130747).


<hr class="tall">

## K.C. Munchkin: Infringement (1982)

<img src="/images/copyright/kc-munchkin-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image">


K.C. Munchkin was an early Pac-Man clone, but not an identical copy. This means we need to "filter out" the unprotectable elements before looking for copyright infringement. The judge first separated the unprotectable "idea" of Pac-Man: 

 > PAC-MAN is a maze-chase game in which the player scores points by guiding a central figure through various passageways of a maze and at the same time avoiding collision with certain opponents or pursuit figures which move independently about the maze. Under certain conditions, the central figure may temporarily become empowered to chase and overtake the opponents, thereby scoring bonus points. [*Atari v. Philips*, 672 F.2d 607 (7th Cir. 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16433139020722034724).

The court then filtered out *scènes à faire* (i.e., stock video game elements):

 > The maze and scoring table are standard game devices, and the tunnel exits are nothing more than the commonly used "wrap around" concept adapted to a maze-chase game. Similarly, the use of dots provides a means by which a player's performance can be gauged and rewarded with the appropriate number of points, and by which to inform the player of his or her progress. Given their close connection with the underlying game, K.C. Munchkin's maze design, scoring table, and "dots" are sufficiently different to preclude a finding of infringement on that basis alone. [*Atari v. Philips*, 672 F.2d 607 (7th Cir. 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16433139020722034724).

The court then looked at Pac-Man's creative expression. A maze-chase game "does not dictate the use of a 'gobbler' and 'ghost monsters.' Those characters are wholly fanciful creations, without reference to the real world." [*Atari v. Philips*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16433139020722034724). Finally, comparing only the protectable creative elements, the court found copyright infringement: 

 > The K.C. Munchkin gobbler has several blatantly similar features, including the relative size and shape of the “body,” the V-shaped “mouth,” its distinctive gobbling action (with appropriate sounds), and especially the way in which it disappears upon being captured. An examination of the K.C. Munchkin ghost monsters reveals even more significant visual similarities. In size, shape, and manner of movement, they are virtually identical to their Pac-Man counterparts. K.C. Munchkin’s monsters, for example, exhibit the same peculiar “eye” and “leg” movement. Both games, moreover, express the role reversal and “regeneration” process with such great similarity that an ordinary observer could conclude only that North American copied plaintiffs’ Pac-Man. [*Atari v. Philips*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16433139020722034724).

**Takeaway**: The *idea* of a maze-chase game is not copyrightable, and the *game mechanics* that necessarily flow from the idea are not copyrightable. However, the creative expression of a gobbler and ghosts, the sound effects and the "role reversal" mechanism are protectable video game elements. Since K.C. Munchkin copied these protectable elements, it was infringing the Pac-Man copyright. 


Next we'll compare Pac-Man, a maze game with fictional characters, to a sports game rooted in non-fiction themes and physics.

## No Infringement of Karate Champ (1988)

<img src="/images/copyright/karate-champ-no-copyright-infringement.png" class="medium-image">

"World Karate Championship" (right) is a clone, more or less, of "Karate Champ" (left).  The two games have similar graphics and game play. But unlike Crazy Kong, World Karate Championship was not an identical clone, and unlike KC Munchkin, it copied elements that were patterned on the real-life sport of Karate. 

The court first filtered out the elements that were unprotectable under the "merger" rule. Data East could not copyright the idea of a karate game, nor any game mechanics that necessarily flow from that idea. The unprotectable elements 
 
 > consist of the game procedure, common karate moves, the idea of background scenes, a time element, a referee, computer graphics, and bonus points, result from either constraints inherent in the sport of karate or computer restraints. After careful consideration and viewing of these features, we find that they necessarily follow from the idea of a martial arts karate combat game, or are inseparable from, indispensable to, or even standard treatment of the idea of the karate sport. As such, they are not protectable. [*Data East v. Epyx*, 862 F.2d 204 (9th Cir. 1988)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5941890015361159855).

As a result, there was no copyright infringement.  Epyx copied only the "idea" of a Karate video game, and the non-copyrightable graphics and game mechanics that necessarily flowed from that idea. 

**Takeaway**: There is no copyright protection for common video game karate moves like "upper-lunge punch", "back-foot sweep" and "squatting reverse punch wherein the heel is not on the ground." 


Now let's look at a case involving Street Fighter II - a fighting game with a much looser basis in "reality."  

<hr class="tall">

## No Infringement of Street Fighter II (1994)


<img src="/images/copyright/capcom-v-data-east-no-copyright-infringment-street-fighter.jpg" class="medium-image">


The creative elements of video games merit stronger copyright protections than the non-fiction elements. Because of this, the judge gave Street Fighter II a narrow scope of copyright protection: 

 > ... there is no question that the games involved in those three cases -– Pac-Man, Galaxian and Donkey Kong –- were far more fanciful than many of the elements presented in Street Fighter II.

While Fighter's History (right) copied most of its details and game play from Street Fighter II, it was careful not to copy the creative game elements: 

> For example, although Guile and Matlok both have spiky hair and wear similar clothing, they are not identical to one another. Guile is a military figure who wears military garb and has a military base as his home stage. Matlok is a “punkrocker” whose characterization is underscored by his tough appearance and “breakdance” type moves. Their magic projectiles, while similar in appearance, are not identical. In keeping with his personality, Matlok throws a spinning compact disc, the form of which is apparent in some video sequences. Guile, on the other hand, throws a Ch’i mental energy ball and shouts “sonic boom” upon its release. This is in keeping with his military persona. [*CapCom v. Data East* (ND CA 1994)](/capcom-v-data-east/). 


The judge also excluded any "*scènes à faire*" elements (i.e., stock elements, cliches, stereotypes) from its copyright analysis. The judge discussed the "vitality bar" and the winner designation. "Neither these individual features, nor their particular compilation in Street Fighter II are original to Capcom. Rather, they are better viewed as unprotectable *scènes à faire*. [*CapCom v. Data East*](/capcom-v-data-east/). 

The court also excluded game control sequences from its analysis under the "merger doctrine":  

 > the control sequences presently at issue cannot be expressed in limitless ways. Rather, the expression of an idea and the underlying idea frequently merge.... The universe of possible joystick combinations is further restricted by the need to have the control sequence emulate the natural movements of the body. To make the game realistic and easy to learn, a developer must have its control sequences follow the natural flow of the fighter’s body. The player must be allowed to manipulate the control panel in an intuitive manner if he or she is going to become proficient at the game. For example, to mirror the physical aspects of throwing an object, the developer would want to choose a joystick/button control sequence that consists of pulling the joystick backwards to follow the arms as they draw back and then moving the joystick forward and hitting a punch button as the character winds up and releases the object. The idea of throwing an object and its expression as reflected in a distinct control sequence will, therefore, coincide. [*CapCom v. Data East*](/capcom-v-data-east/).

Some special moves were unprotectable "scènes à faire", while other special moves were copyrightable creative expression. According to the court, these 7 moves were not protectable:  "(1) Sagat’s 'tiger knee' which is a common kickboxing move; (2) E. Honda’s 'knee bash' which is a common wrestling move; (3) Vega’s mid-air throw which is a basic fight maneuver; (4) Vega’s floor slide which again is a basic fight maneuver; (5) Balrog’s 'dashing punch' which is a simple punch; (6) Zangief’s 'backwards throw'; and (7) Zangief’s 'body leap' both of which are common wrestling moves." Two special moves were protectable: "Chun Li’s head stomp and E. Honda’s 100 hand slap." [*CapCom v. Data East*](/capcom-v-data-east/).

Since Fighter's History only copied (a) non-protectable functional game elements, and (b) non-protectable scènes à faire, it was not infringing the Street Fighter II copyright. Check out [the appendix](/capcom-v-data-east/#appendix) of the case for a detailed copyright analysis of the fighters, special moves and combos.

## No Infringement of Golden Tee Golf (2005)

<img src="/images/copyright/goldentee-v-pga-tour-no-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image" >

Incredible Technologies made the popular Golden Tee arcade game (left). Virtual Technologies made PGA Tour (right) with the explicit purpose of cloning Golden Tee. The games and controls were very similar: 

 > The size and shape of PGA Tour Golf's control panel, and the placement of its trackball and buttons, are nearly identical to those of Golden Tee. The "shot shaping" choices are depicted in a similar way and in the same sequence. Although the software on the two games is dissimilar, both allow a player to simulate a straight shot, a fade, a slice, a draw, a hook, etc. by the direction in which the trackball is rolled back and pushed forward. [*Incredible Technologies v. Virtual Technologies*, 400 F. 3d 1007 (7th Cir. 2005)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10633608556007842361). 

Before comparing the two golf games, the court filtered out the standard golf themes under the *scènes à faire* doctrine: 

 > In presenting a realistic video golf game, one would, by definition, need golf courses, clubs, a selection menu, a golfer, a wind meter, etc. Sand traps and water hazards are a fact of life for golfers, real and virtual. The menu screens are standard to the video arcade game format, as are prompts showing the distance remaining to the hole. As such, the video display is afforded protection only from virtually identical copying. [*Incredible Tech. v. Virtual Tech.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10633608556007842361). 

Condescending golf announcers are apparently *scènes à faire*. Any golf game can use condescending announcers, but they can't copy the identical condescending phrases. Fortunately for PGA Tour, it didn't copy the phrases: 

> "the fairway would be over there" and "I don't think that's going to help a whole lot" in PGA Tour versus "That can only hurt," "You've got to be kidding," and "You can lead a ball to water but ..." from the Golden Tee announcers. [*Incredible Tech. v. Virtual Tech.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10633608556007842361).

**Takeaway**: Video game controls (like a trackball) and instructions are entitled to very little, if any, copyright protection. 


<hr class="tall">

## Interlude: In Early Video Game Cases, Designers Had More Leeway to Copy Because Design Options were Limited by Primitive Technology. 

Early video games systems didn't give designers many pixels to work with. That means games were more likely to look similar. E.g., if a designer only has 192 pixels and 25 colors to draw with, she shouldn't be penalized for drawing a character that happens to look like Mario. As a result of these early technical limitations, designers were given more leeway to copy from previous games. 
 
"Furthermore, the mere indispensable expression of these ideas, based on the technical requirements of the videogame medium, may be protected only against virtually identical copying." Frybarger v. IBM. 

Modern video game graphics are a little different. With high-resolution graphics and vivid colors, any similarities between games should be eyed with closer suspicion.

## No Infringement of Police Trainer 2

<img src="/images/copyright/police-trainer-2-title.jpg" class="medium-image">

Boyer designed the game "Sharpshooter", and recognized some similarities in Team Play's "Police Trainer 2." Specifically, he claimed Police Trainer 2 stole: 

1. a shooting challenge in which targets float out of a cylindrical opening in the floor; 

2. a shooting challenge in which targets are randomly arranged, and a player must remember which are which and only shoot certain targets; 

3. a shooting challenge in which targets randomly "pop" out of cylindrical openings for the player to shoot; and 

4.silver iconic objects that appear next to each completed challenge as a progress indicator.


Sadly for Boyer, the judge decided that all 4 items of "allegedly misappropriated graphical art" were either uncopyrightable ideas or *scene a faire*. "In each instance, they are subject to copyright protection only from virtually identical copying." [*Team Play v. Boyer*, 391 F. Supp. 2d 695 (ND Ill 2005)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3622100013857292984). 



## No Infringement of Dawn of the Dead (2008)

<img src="/images/copyright/dawn-of-the-dead-v-dead-rising-no-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image">

Capcom's *Dead Rising* game took inspiration from George Romero's 1979 zombie classic *Dawn of the Dead*. In its copyright analysis, the court noted several similarities. In both works: (1) the story kicks off with a helicopter ride to a rural mall infested with zombies; (2) the mall has a gun shop; and (3) propane tanks and chainsaws are used in creative ways to kill zombies. Both works also parody rampant consumerism and critique sensational journalism. 

Before comparing the game to the original movie, the court filtered out the unprotectable scènes à faire (i.e., stock zombie elements). Unfortunately for Romero's Dawn of the Dead, all of the similarities were "driven by the wholly unprotectable concept of humans battling zombies in a mall during a zombie outbreak." *Capcom v. MKR Group*, 2008 WL 4661479 (N.D. Cal. 2008). Since Capcom's video game only copied unprotectable ideas, there was no copyright infringement. 

**Takeaway**: Using chainsaws to kill zombies is scènes à faire; its cliche, not creative copyrightable expression. 

<hr class="tall">

## Tetris Infringed by Mino (2012)

<img src="/images/copyright/tetris-v-mino-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image" >

Soon after college, Desiree Golden started a video game company called Xio Interactive. Before releasing Mino, a Tetris clone for iOS (right), she did some copyright research: 

 > Before releasing its product, Xio researched copyright law, both through its own independent studying and based on advice of counsel... Based on this research, Xio believed it could freely copy any part of Tetris that was based on a "rule of the game" or that Xio viewed as being functional to the game. [*Tetris v. Xio Interactive*, 863 F.Supp.2d 394 (D. NJ 2012)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18064882260025243346).

She understood the law, but perhaps not how the law applied to Tetris. When she tried to draw the line between unprotectable game mechanics and protectable creative expression, she drew it in the wrong place, and granted herself far too much leeway to copy from Tetris. 

Here's how the *Tetris v. Xio* court identified the unprotectable "rules" of Tetris: 

 > Tetris is a puzzle game where a user manipulates pieces composed of square blocks, each made into a different geometric shape, that fall from the top of the game board to the bottom where the pieces accumulate. The user is given a new piece after the current one reaches the bottom of the available game space. While a piece is falling, the user rotates it in order to fit it in with the accumulated pieces. The object of the puzzle is to fill all spaces along a horizontal line. If that is accomplished, the line is erased, points are earned, and more of the game board is available for play. But if the pieces accumulate and reach the top of the screen, then the game is over. These then are the general, abstract ideas underlying Tetris and cannot be protected by copyright nor can expressive elements that are inseparable from them. [*Tetris v. Xio*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18064882260025243346). 

The *idea* of a falling-block puzzle game is not protectable. However, the *creative expression* of that idea as Tetris is protectable. The court decided that the style of the pieces and the way they move through space was protectable creative expression: 

 > The style, design, shape, and movement of the pieces are expression; they are not part of the ideas, rules, or functions of the game nor are they essential or inseparable from the ideas, rules, or functions of the game. [*Tetris v. Xio*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18064882260025243346). 

Since Mino copied the exact same 7 Tetris shapes, the same board dimensions (10 x 20) and the way the shapes moved through the board, it infringed the Tetris copyright. 

**Takeaway**: Don't get your legal advice from blogs?

## Infringement in Triple Town v. Yeti Town (2012)

<img src="/images/copyright/tripletown-v-yeti-town-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image">


LolApp cloned the successful Triple Town (left) to make Yeti Town (right). As usual, the copyright analysis starts by filtering out the unprotectable ideas: 

> The idea underlying Triple Town is that of a hierarchical matching game, one in which players create objects that are higher in the hierarchy by matching three objects that are lower in the hierarchy. Frustrating the player’s efforts are antagonist objects; aiding the player are objects that destroy unwanted or ill-placed objects. Spry Fox’s copyright gives it no monopoly over this idea. [*Spry Fox v. LolApps* (WD WA 2012)](/spry-fox-v-lolapps-2012/). 

In addition to the unprotectable idea, Triple Town used some unprotectable *scènes à faire*. The use of points and “coins” to reward a player’s progress is standard. The display of visual game tips in the margins of the game screen is also standard. Finally, the notion of an in-game marketplace where the player can redeem coins for game advantages is standard. [*Spry Fox v. LolApps*](/spry-fox-v-lolapps-2012/). 

The court also filtered out unprotectable game mechanics. Using a six-by-six game grid is not an expressive choice. "A grid that is too small would make the game trivial; a grid that  is too large would make it pointless." Similarly, the pricing structure in Triple Town’s marketplace, along with its strategic limits on how many advantages a player can purchase, are functional considerations. [*Spry Fox v. LolApps*](/spry-fox-v-lolapps-2012/).  

Looking at the remaining protectable game elements, the court decided they were likely infringing. 

 > In Triple Town, the antagonist is a bear. In Yeti Town, the antagonist is a yeti... bears and yetis are both wild creatures... [*Spry Fox v. LolApps*](/spry-fox-v-lolapps-2012/).  
 
 > The object hierarchy is similar. Progressing from grass to bush to tree to hut is similar to progressing from sapling to tree to tent to cabin. Perhaps more importantly, the object hierarchy coupled with the depiction of the field of play comprise a setting and theme that is similar to Triple Town’s. [*Spry Fox v. LolApps*](/spry-fox-v-lolapps-2012/).
 
The judge also defers to the opinion of video game bloggers: "The bloggers, who are ordinary observers of video games, find Yeti Town and Triple Town to be substantially similar."  In any event, this case was settled before a final decision was reached, and Yeti Town is no longer available in the app store. 

**Takeaway**: Copyright protections for video game mechanics seem to be expanding. This is bad news for cloners. Also, video game bloggers can apparently make a difference in copyright cases.

## Bang! Role Playing Card Game Copyrightable (2014)

<img src="/images/copyright/bang-v-lotk-copyright.jpg" class="translucent">


A recent case involving non-video games further solidifies the idea that game mechanics can be copyrightable.  DaVinci made the original "Bang!" game (left), and  accused Ziko of copyright infringement for its "Legend of the Three Kingdoms" game (right). The parties agreed that the game mechanics were identical, but the game art was entirely different: 

> The parties agree that Bang! and LOTK have nearly identical rules for playing the game. The setting, artwork, and written instructions are substantially different. LOTK is 're-set in ancient China instead of the wild-west.' The 'ancient Chinese' themed roles in LOTK (the Monarch, Minister, Rebel, and Turncoat) fulfill the same roles as the Sheriff, Deputy, Outlaw, and Renegade in Bang!. [*Da Vinci v. Ziko Games* (SD Texas 2014)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5597788239119337082)(punctuation omitted). 

Drawing on video game cases, the judge decided that the Bang! *game mechanics* were not copyrightable. "The similar uses of life points, distance between players, action cards, and rewards and punishments do not constitute actionable copying." [*Da Vinci v. Ziko Games*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5597788239119337082)

However, the Bang! characters and capabilities are copyrightable: 

 > the corresponding characters in the two games have substantially similar capabilities. Each character card in both games has a name, picture, and a description of the character's capabilities and life points. The defendants allegedly copied these capabilities and life points, simply changing the names and artwork. The questions are whether these character elements are protected and whether translating the Bang! characters from a Wild West to an ancient China theme infringes that protection.

 > Given the similarities between the attributes of the characters in Bang! and in LOTK, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the characters of the two games are substantially similar despite the transposition and translation from the Wild-West theme of Bang! to the ancient China theme of LOTK.

Character *roles*, unlike game rules, are copyrightable: 

 > The players in both games play virtually identical roles. ... such roles and their expression are not merely rules that prescribe what the players may do; the roles and their expression also describe how the players may do it. If the roles describe the content of the players' interactions in ways that are sufficiently original or creative to merit copyright protection, players' roles can be protectable. 

The judge contrasted the fictional Bang! game with the realistic golf simulation case (Incredible Tech. v. Virtual Tech). If two golf simulation games are similar, its probably because both games are copying from the sport of golf. If two fictional role playing games are similar, the second may have copied from the first: 

 > There is a limited number of ways for the game designer to show a golfer, a course, a swing, and the ultimate goal: putting the ball in the hole. Such limits do not apply to role-playing games like Bang!. There are nearly infinite ways of expressing the concepts of player elimination or a contest between authorities and their opponents. Instead of choosing a different manner of expressing these concepts, the defendants copied into LOTK protectable elements of DaVinci's original and creative expression in Bang!
 
For context, this is a very early decision in the case. The judge isn't answering the question of whether there is copyright infringement. He is answering the question of whether the plaintiff's copyright claims are *so weak* they can be thrown out on a preliminary "motion to dismiss." The answer was that the copyright claims were plausible, and so they survived the preliminary motion to dismiss. 

The case is ongoing (as of October 2014), so we will keep watching.

## Conclusion

Video game copyright cases turn on whether the clone copied "functional" elements (tolerated) or "creative" elements (verboten). When looking for similarities between the clone and the original game, we need to mentally "filter out" the unprotectable game elements using several different techniques: 

**Idea-Expression Dichotomy**.  First we filter out the unprotectable "ideas" from the protectable expression. 

- The *idea* of a karate style fighting game can't be copyrighted. 
- The *expression* of E. Honda’s "100 hand slap" can be protected by copyright. 
- The *idea* of a maze-chase game can't be copyrighted.  
- The *expression* of a chomping gobbler antagonized by colorful ghosts can be protected by copyright.

**Merger Rule**. If there is only one way to express a particular idea, then idea and expression "merge", and the policy favoring free ideas drags both idea and expression into the public domain. Basic game-play and controls, especially in realistic sports games, are often "merged" with the idea of the game itself and therefore ineligible for copyright protection.

**Functional Elements**. Copyright does not “extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation...” 17 USC § 102(b). Game mechanics are often unprotectable as functional or "methods of operation." 

**Scènes à Faire**. Copyright doesn't protect cliches, stereotypes, stock elements or standard treatments. For example, Pac-Man's dots, Street Fighters vitality bar, and zombie-chainsaw-decapitations are all unprotectable *scènes à faire*. (It's Frech for "that which must be done"). 

The copyright infringement analysis is more an art than a science. The line between creative expression and unprotectable ideas is famously elusive. As Judge Learned Hand (real name) put it, "Nobody has ever been able to fix that boundary, and nobody ever can." [*Nichols v. Universal*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14991934121439658064).

# How to Prepare for the Clones

### Copyright Registration. 

First, register the US copyright to your games. It's not particularly expensive. I've collected the Copyright Office's [recent guidance on video game copyright registration here](/video-game-copyright-registration/). Register several copyrights covering several different aspects of your game, including the code itself and any particularly interesting characters or art. Think about the creative expression in your game, and try to hone in on these creative aspects when filing for a copyright. 

You can even register copyrights before you publish your game, to avoid a  [Ridiculous Fishing](http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/5/3461458/cloning-case-files-vlambeer) scenario, where the clone launches *before* the original. 

### Trademark Registration. 

Second, register the US Trademark in the name of your game. This is more expensive, but it provides broader rights. It prevents other people from making a similar game under a *similar title*. If you own the registered trademark, you can at least force cloners to think up a different name. 

The trademark registration should describe your game play in some detail in its "description of goods and services." A similar-sounding name along side an exact match of the goods and services can be powerful clone deterrent. 

We discuss [trademark law in detail](/trademark-basics/), and offer a [DIY walkthrough of the trademark registration process](http://adlervermillion.com/how-to-trademark-part-2-registration-guide/). Our [trademark services are summarized here](/trademark-services/). 

### Trade Dress

A trademark registration for the game's "trade dress" can also be useful. Trade Dress can protects a product's packaging as well as a product's unique-and-non-functional shape or appearance.  Tetris was able to leverage it's trade dress in its case against Mino. However, trade dress is a tricky area of law, and should be approached with caution. 

<img src="/images/trademark/tetris-trade-dress-registration.png" class="translucent">

### Patents

Patents are the most expensive option, but provide the most valuable protection. Budget about $8,000 for a patent application. Patents are slow. They take about 3 years to issue on average. If you pay extra to expedite the filing, a patent can issue in just under 1 year. 

For small mobile games, patents may be too expensive. However, if you are building a truly new and innovative game, a small patent portfolio may still be a worthwhile investment. We discuss [patent law here](/patent-basics), and our [patent services here](/patent-services).

<img src="/images/patent-drawings/pong-patent-1972.png">



### Enforcement and Public Relations

While clones can be infuriating, it's important to remember that aggressive legal tactics can backfire. Consider a public relations campaign before, or in tandem with, any legal action. A carefully worded copyright infringement letter from a lawyer can be powerful, especially when it makes you look like the reasonable party. The letter should accurately describe the law and similarities between the games, and politely (but firmly) demand that the clone be removed from the app store. 

The first legal action for apps may involve sending a DMCA takedown notice to the appropriate app store. For iOS, You can submit a claim through Apple's [iTunes Content Dispute](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appstorenotices/) form. For Android, submit through Google's [Legal Removal Requests](https://support.google.com/legal) page.
