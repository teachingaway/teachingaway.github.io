<p class="big-text">Video game copyright lawsuits can have weird results. For example, Copying Chun Li's 'head stomp' is infringement, but copying Sagat’s 'tiger knee' is totally fine. Video game designers that understand basic copyright law can develop games that are more difficult to clone, and also take inspiration from existing games without running afoul of copyright prohibitions.</p>

Copyright protects the original <em>creative expression</em> of an idea, but never the <em>idea itself</em>, and never any "systems" or "methods of operation" or utilitarian elements. Video game copyright lawsuits live or die based on whether or not the clone copied "creative expression" from the original game. Our first case is about Atari's Breakout, and whether it has any protectable creative expression at all.

## Even Simple Video Games are Copyrightable: Breakout (1992)

Atari, maker of "Breakout" (left) was unhappy with Romstar's "Arkanoid" game (right). But before Atari could sue for copyright infringement, it needed to register its copyright. The Copyright Office initially refused, dismissing the "Breakout" game as a collection of functional rules, basic shapes and colors, and lacking any creative authorship. In response, Atari appealed the matter to a young Ruth Bader-Ginsburg (59). 

Ginsburg appreciated the creativity involved in designing video games. While simple shapes and colors are unprotectable, Atari's *selection and arrangement* of simple shapes were copyrightable, especially because they were paired with creative sound effects. And while game mechanics based on pure physics are public domain, the Breakout game mechanics are governed by creative physics: 
 
 > The ball's path in Breakout varies depending on which of four sections of the paddle it hits. Its trajectory does not follow from the laws of physics. [*Atari v. Oman*, 979 F.2d 242 (DC CA 1992)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11202168367195629653).

Judge Ginsburg concludes that Breakout includes the types of creative expression that merits copyright protection, and cajoles the Copyright Office into approving Atari's copyright registration. 

 > The abstract representation in Breakout is neither an "obvious" nor an "inevitable" choice. Nor is the coordination of a square "ball" and a rectangular shrinking paddle a "time-honored" or "conventional" combination. The same may be said of the choice of colors, the placement and design of the scores, the changes in speed, the use of sounds, and the synchronized graphics and sounds which accompany the ball's bounces behind the wall. [*Atari v. Oman*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11202168367195629653) (edited for length).

**Takeaway**: While Breakout is a game of simple shapes and rules, the arrangement of those shapes was sufficiently creative to merit copyright protection, especially because the game-mechanics were based in fictional physics. On the other hand, games that rely more heavily on the laws of physics, like many realistic sports games, will merit weaker copyright protection.

## Infringement: Crazy Kong (1982)

Elcon made a straight-up Donkey Kong clone called "Crazy Kong." Crazy Kong "embodies audio-video material, including the characters on the screen and the sound, that is virtually identical" to Donkey Kong. [*Nintendo v. Elcon*, 564 F. Supp. 937 (ED Mich 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14413211357527714092). Crazy Kong didn't just copy game mechanics or unprotectable ideas. Crazy Kong copied everything. Predictably, this is copyright infringement.  The more interesting copyright cases below involve games that make at least a minimal effort to differentiate themselves from the originals.

**Takeaway**: identical cloning is copyright infringement.

<img src="/images/copyright/kc-munchkin-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image">

## K.C. Munchkin: Infringement (1982)

K.C. Munchkin was an early Pac-Man clone, but not an identical copy. This means we need to "filter out" the unprotectable elements before looking for copyright infringement. The court first filtered out *scènes à faire* (i.e., stock video game elements):

 > The maze and scoring table are standard game devices, and the tunnel exits are nothing more than the commonly used "wrap around" concept adapted to a maze-chase game. Similarly, the use of dots provides a means by which a player's performance can be gauged and rewarded with the appropriate number of points, and by which to inform the player of his or her progress. Given their close connection with the underlying game, K. C. Munchkin's maze design, scoring table, and "dots" are sufficiently different to preclude a finding of infringement on that basis alone. [*Atari v. Philips*, 672 F.2d 607 (7th Cir. 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16433139020722034724).

The court then looked at Pac-Man's creative expression. A maze-chase game "does not dictate the use of a 'gobbler' and 'ghost monsters.' Those characters are wholly fanciful creations, without reference to the real world." [*Atari v. Philips*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16433139020722034724). Finally, comparing only the protectable creative elements, the court found copyright infringement: 

 > The K.C. Munchkin gobbler has several blatantly similar features, including the relative size and shape of the “body,” the V-shaped “mouth,” its distinctive gobbling action (with appropriate sounds), and especially the way in which it disappears upon being captured. An examination of the K.C. Munchkin ghost monsters reveals even more significant visual similarities. In size, shape, and manner of movement, they are virtually identical to their Pac-Man counterparts. K.C. Munchkin’s monsters, for example, exhibit the same peculiar “eye” and “leg” movement. Both games, moreover, express the role reversal and “regeneration” process with such great similarity that an ordinary observer could conclude only that North American copied plaintiffs’ Pac-Man. [*Atari v. Philips*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16433139020722034724).

**Takeaway**: The *idea* of a maze-chase game is not copyrightable, and the *game mechanics* that necessarily flow from the idea are not copyrightable. However, the creative expression of a gobbler and ghosts, the sound effects and the "role reversal" mechanism are protectable video game elements. Since K.C. Munchkin copied these protectable elements, it was infringing the Pac-Man copyright. 

Next we'll compare Pac-Man, a maze game with fictional characters, to a sports game rooted in non-fiction themes and physics.

## No Infringement of Karate Champ (1988)

"World Karate Championship" (right) is a clone, more or less, of "Karate Champ" (left).  The two games have similar graphics and game play. But unlike Crazy Kong, World Karate Championship was not an identical clone, and unlike KC Munchkin, it copied elements that were patterned on the real-life sport of Karate. 

The court first filtered out the elements that were unprotectable under the "merger" rule. Data East could not copyright the idea of a karate game, nor any game mechanics that necessarily flow from that idea. The unprotectable elements 
 
 > consist of the game procedure, common karate moves, the idea of background scenes, a time element, a referee, computer graphics, and bonus points, result from either constraints inherent in the sport of karate or computer restraints. After careful consideration and viewing of these features, we find that they necessarily follow from the idea of a martial arts karate combat game, or are inseparable from, indispensable to, or even standard treatment of the idea of the karate sport. As such, they are not protectable. [*Data East v. Epyx*, 862 F.2d 204 (9th Cir. 1988)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5941890015361159855).

As a result, there was no copyright infringement.  Epyx copied only the "idea" of a Karate video game, and the non-copyrightable graphics and game mechanics that necessarily flowed from that idea. 

**Takeaway**: There is no copyright protection for common video game karate moves like "upper-lunge punch", "back-foot sweep" and "squatting reverse punch wherein the heel is not on the ground." 


Now let's look at a clone of Street Fighter II - a fighting game with a much looser basis in reality than World Karate.  

<hr class="tall">

<img src="/images/copyright/capcom-v-data-east-no-copyright-infringment-street-fighter.jpg" class="medium-image">

## No Infringement of Street Fighter II (1994)

The creative elements of video games merit stronger copyright protections than the non-fiction elements. While Fighter's History (right) copied most of its details and game play from Street Fighter II, it was careful not to copy the creative game elements: 

> For example, although Guile and Matlok both have spiky hair and wear similar clothing, they are not identical to one another. Guile is a military figure who wears military garb and has a military base as his home stage. Matlok is a “punkrocker” whose characterization is underscored by his tough appearance and “breakdance” type moves. Their magic projectiles, while similar in appearance, are not identical. In keeping with his personality, Matlok throws a spinning compact disc, the form of which is apparent in some video sequences. Guile, on the other hand, throws a Ch’i mental energy ball and shouts “sonic boom” upon its release. This is in keeping with his military persona. [*CapCom v. Data East* (ND CA 1994)](/capcom-v-data-east/). 


The court also excluded any "scènes à faire" elements (i.e., stock elements, cliches, stereotypes) from its copyright analysis:

 > Almost all of the games, for example, have a vitality bar that runs across the top of the video screen and changes color to indicate the percentage of strength the fighter has left. In addition, most of the games contain similar winner designations to indicate which fighter has won the round. Neither these individual features, nor their particular compilation in Street Fighter II are original to Capcom. Rather, they are better viewed as unprotectable scènes à faire.... Consequently, they are not entitled to copyright protection. [*CapCom v. Data East*](/capcom-v-data-east/).

The court also excluded game control sequences from its analysis under the "merger doctrine":  

 > the control sequences presently at issue cannot be expressed in limitless ways. Rather, the expression of an idea and the underlying idea frequently merge.... The universe of possible joystick combinations is further restricted by the need to have the control sequence emulate the natural movements of the body. To make the game realistic and easy to learn, a developer must have its control sequences follow the natural flow of the fighter’s body. The player must be allowed to manipulate the control panel in an intuitive manner if he or she is going to become proficient at the game. For example, to mirror the physical aspects of throwing an object, the developer would want to choose a joystick/button control sequence that consists of pulling the joystick backwards to follow the arms as they draw back and then moving the joystick forward and hitting a punch button as the character winds up and releases the object. The idea of throwing an object and its expression as reflected in a distinct control sequence will, therefore, coincide. [*CapCom v. Data East*)](/capcom-v-data-east/).

Some special moves were unprotectable "scènes à faire", while other special moves were copyrightable creative expression. According to the court, these 7 moves were not protectable:  "(1) Sagat’s 'tiger knee' which is a common kickboxing move; (2) E. Honda’s 'knee bash' which is a common wrestling move; (3) Vega’s mid-air throw which is a basic fight maneuver; (4) Vega’s floor slide which again is a basic fight maneuver; (5) Balrog’s 'dashing punch' which is a simple punch; (6) Zangief’s 'backwards throw'; and (7) Zangief’s 'body leap' both of which are common wrestling moves." Two special moves were protectable: "Chun Li’s head stomp and E. Honda’s 100 hand slap." [*CapCom v. Data East*](/capcom-v-data-east/).

Since Fighter's History only copied (a) non-protectable functional game elements, and (b) non-protectable scènes à faire, it was not infringing the Street Fighter II copyright. Check out [the appendix](/capcom-v-data-east/#appendix) of the case for a detailed copyright analysis of the fighters, special moves and combos.

### No Infringement of Golden Tee Golf (2005)

Incredible Technologies made the popular Golden Tee arcade game (left). 
Virtual Technologies made PGA Tour (right) with the explicit purpose of cloning Golden Tee. The games and controls were very similar: 

 > The size and shape of PGA Tour Golf's control panel, and the placement of its trackball and buttons, are nearly identical to those of Golden Tee. The "shot shaping" choices are depicted in a similar way and in the same sequence. Although the software on the two games is dissimilar, both allow a player to simulate a straight shot, a fade, a slice, a draw, a hook, etc. by the direction in which the trackball is rolled back and pushed forward. [*Incredible Technologies v. Virtual Technologies*, 400 F. 3d 1007 (7th Cir. 2005)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10633608556007842361). 

Before comparing the two golf games, the court filtered out the standard golf themes under the *scènes à faire* doctrine: 

 > In presenting a realistic video golf game, one would, by definition, need golf courses, clubs, a selection menu, a golfer, a wind meter, etc. Sand traps and water hazards are a fact of life for golfers, real and virtual. The menu screens are standard to the video arcade game format, as are prompts showing the distance remaining to the hole. As such, the video display is afforded protection only from virtually identical copying. [*Incredible Tech. v. Virtual Tech.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10633608556007842361). 

Condescending golf announcers are apparently *scènes à faire*. Any golf game can use condescending announcers, but they can't copy the identical condescending phrases. PGA Tour didn't copy the phrases: 

> "the fairway would be over there" and "I don't think that's going to help a whole lot" in PGA Tour versus "That can only hurt," "You've got to be kidding," and "You can lead a ball to water but ..." from the Golden Tee announcers. [*Incredible Tech. v. Virtual Tech.*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10633608556007842361).

**Takeaway**: Video game controls (like a trackball) and instructions are entitled to very little, if any, copyright protection.

### Tetris Infringed by Mino (2012)

Soon after college, Desiree Golden started a video game company called Xio Interactive. Before releasing Mino, a Tetris clone for iOS (right), she did some copyright research: 

 > Before releasing its product, Xio researched copyright law, both through its own independent studying and based on advice of counsel... Based on this research, Xio believed it could freely copy any part of Tetris that was based on a "rule of the game" or that Xio viewed as being functional to the game. [*Tetris v. Xio Interactive*, 863 F.Supp.2d 394 (D. NJ 2012). ](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18064882260025243346).

She understood the law, but perhaps not how the law applied to Tetris. When she tried to draw the line between unprotectable game mechanics and protectable creative expression, she drew it in the wrong place, and granted herself far too much leeway to copy from Tetris. 

Here's how the Tetris v. Xio court identified the unprotectable "rules" of Tetris: 

 > Tetris is a puzzle game where a user manipulates pieces composed of square blocks, each made into a different geometric shape, that fall from the top of the game board to the bottom where the pieces accumulate. The user is given a new piece after the current one reaches the bottom of the available game space. While a piece is falling, the user rotates it in order to fit it in with the accumulated pieces. The object of the puzzle is to fill all spaces along a horizontal line. If that is accomplished, the line is erased, points are earned, and more of the game board is available for play. But if the pieces accumulate and reach the top of the screen, then the game is over. These then are the general, abstract ideas underlying Tetris and cannot be protected by copyright nor can expressive elements that are inseparable from them. [*Tetris v. Xio*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18064882260025243346). 

The *idea* of a falling-block puzzle game is not protectable. However, the *creative expression* of that idea as Tetris is protectable. The court decided that the style of the pieces and the way they move through space was protectable creative expression: 

 > The style, design, shape, and movement of the pieces are expression; they are not part of the ideas, rules, or functions of the game nor are they essential or inseparable from the ideas, rules, or functions of the game. [*Tetris v. Xio*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18064882260025243346). 

Since Mino copied the exact same 7 Tetris shapes, the same board dimensions (10 x 20) and the way the shapes moved through the board, it infringed the Tetris copyright. 

**Takeaway**: Don't get your legal advice from blogs?

## No Infringement of Dawn of the Dead (2008)
 
Capcom's Dead Rising game took inspiration from George Romero's 1979 zombie classic "Dawn of the Dead." In its copyright analysis, the court noted several similarities. In both works: (1) the story kicks off with a helicopter ride to a rural mall infested with zombies; (2) the mall has a gun shop; and (3) propane tanks and chainsaws are used in creative ways to kill zombies. Both works also parody rampant consumerism and critique sensational journalism. 

Before comparing the game to the original movie, the court filtered out the unprotectable scènes à faire (i.e., stock zombie elements). Unfortunately for Romero's Dawn of the Dead, all of the similarities were "driven by the wholly unprotectable concept of humans battling zombies in a mall during a zombie outbreak." *Capcom v. MKR Group*, 2008 WL 4661479 (N.D. Cal. 2008). Since Capcom's video game only copied unprotectable ideas, there was no copyright infringement. 

**Takeaway**: Using chainsaws to kill zombies is scènes à faire; its cliche, not creative copyrightable expression. 


<hr class="tall">

<img src="/images/copyright/tripletown-v-yeti-town-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image">

### Copyright Infringement in Triple Town v. Yeti Town (2012)

LolApp cloned the successful Triple Town (left) to make Yeti Town (right). As usual, the copyright analysis starts by filtering out the unprotectable ideas: 

> The idea underlying Triple Town is that of a hierarchical matching game, one in which players create objects that are higher in the hierarchy by matching three objects that are lower in the hierarchy. Frustrating the player’s efforts are antagonist objects; aiding the player are objects that destroy unwanted or ill-placed objects. Spry Fox’s copyright gives it no monopoly over this idea. *Spry Fox v. LolApps* (WD WA 2012). 

In addition to the unprotectable idea, Triple Town used some unprotectable *scènes à faire*. The use of points and “coins” to reward a player’s progress is standard. The display of visual game tips in the margins of the game screen is also standard. Finally, the notion of an in-game marketplace where the player can redeem coins for game advantages is standard. [*Spry Fox v. LolApps* (WD WA 2012)](https://pdf.yt/d/GXzLJQoYSlV1mdmC). 

The court also filtered out unprotectable game mechanics. Using a six-by-six game grid is not an expressive choice. "A grid that is too small would make the game trivial; a grid that  is too large would make it pointless." Similarly, the pricing structure in Triple Town’s marketplace, along with its strategic limits on how many advantages a player can purchase, are functional considerations. [*Spry Fox v. LolApps* (WD WA 2012)](https://pdf.yt/d/GXzLJQoYSlV1mdmC).  

Looking at the remaining protectable game elements, the court decided they were likely infringing. 

 > In Triple Town, the antagonist is a bear. In Yeti Town, the antagonist is a yeti... bears and yetis are both wild creatures... [*Spry Fox v. LolApps* (WD WA 2012)](https://pdf.yt/d/GXzLJQoYSlV1mdmC).  
 
 > The object hierarchy is similar. Progressing from grass to bush to tree to hut is similar to progressing from sapling to tree to tent to cabin. Perhaps more importantly, the object hierarchy coupled with the depiction of the field of play comprise a setting and theme that is similar to Triple Town’s. [*Spry Fox v. LolApps* (WD WA 2012)](https://pdf.yt/d/GXzLJQoYSlV1mdmC).
 
The judge also defers to the opinion of video game bloggers: "The bloggers, who are ordinary observers of video games, find Yeti Town and Triple Town to be substantially similar."  In any event, this case was settled before a final decision was reached, and Yeti Town is no longer available in the app store. 

**Takeaway**: Copyright protections for video game mechanics seem to be expanding. This is bad news for cloners. Also, video game bloggers can apparently make a difference in copyright cases.

## Conclusion

Video game copyright cases turn on whether the clone copied "functional" elements (tolerated) or "creative" elements (verboten). When looking for similarities between the clone and the original game, we need to mentally "filter out" the unprotectable game elements using several different techniques: 

**Idea-Expression Dichotomy**.  First we filter out the unprotectable "ideas" from the protectable expression. 

- The *idea* of a karate style fighting game can't be copyrighted. 
- The *expression* of E. Honda’s "100 hand slap" can be protected by copyright. 
- The *idea* of a maze-chase game can't be copyrighted.  
- The *expression* of a chomping gobbler antagonized by colorful ghosts can be protected by copyright.

**Merger Rule**. If there is only one way to express a particular idea, then idea and expression "merge", and the policy favoring free ideas drags both idea and expression into the public domain. Basic game-play and controls, especially in realistic sports games, are often "merged" with the idea of the game itself and therefore ineligible for copyright protection.

**Functional Elements**. Copyright does not “extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation...” 17 USC § 102(b). Game mechanics are often unprotectable as functional or "methods of operation." 

**Scènes à Faire**. Copyright doesn't protect cliches, stereotypes, stock elements or standard treatments. For example, Pac-Man's dots, Street Fighters vitality bar, and zombie-chainsaw-decapitations are all unprotectable *scènes à faire*. (It's Frech for "that which must be done"). 

The copyright infringement analysis is more an art than a science. For example, the size of the game board in Tetris (10x20) was copyrightable "expression" while the size of the game board in Triple Town (6x6) was an unprotectable "functional" game mechanic. The line between creative expression and unprotectable ideas is famously elusive. As Judge Learned Hand (real name) put it, "Nobody has ever been able to fix that boundary, and nobody ever can." [*Nichols v. Universal*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14991934121439658064).
