<p class="big-text">Jekyll is a simple static website generator. Jekyll transforms Markdown into a complete, *static* website.  We switched to Jekyll because it reflects our values as a law firm: keep it simple, prioritize efficiency over bloat, and use the right size tool for the job.</p> 

I started building websites 15 years ago, I built static websites. This involves lots of miserable copy/pasting of HTML and updating links. When I discovered Wordpress, I thought it solved my problems. I used Wordpress for years. Before Jekyll, our website ran on Wordpress. Wordpress had lots of fancy features, but these features made it slow. Wordpress is slow because it serves up dynamic content from a database. When a user hits a Wordpress site, the server chats back and forth with a database, and then builds the whole website. When the next visitor shows up, Wordpress builds the website all over again. Wordpress is painfully slow on Media Temple, Dreamhost, Bluehost, and Wordpress.com.

While Wordpress' dynamic system allows for lots of fancy internet bling, I don't need bling for my blog. I needed a fast website. 

Enter Jekyll. Unlike wordpress, which re-builds a website for each new visitor, Jekyll builds the website once, and then re-serves the same static website over and over. Since Jekyll doesn't query a database each time it serves a website, its much faster than Wordpress. 

We run our law practice like Jekyll, not Wordpress. When a client presents a simple legal question, we don't waste time building a solution from scratch. Instead, we build simple, versatile solutions that can be reused by clients facing similar problems. ???


## Github Pages: Lives in Github

Our website lives in Github and uses their wonderful CDN. Github pages can be set up in [5 quick steps](https://pages.github.com/). If you already use Github, its more like 2 steps. If not, building a Github page is a great way to familiarize yourself with Github.  



## CSS Styles with LESS

I started using [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) last month to build this website. It felt like escaping from the front-end stone age. LESS is a CSS "preprocessor" (whatever that means). All I know that writing CSS is [repetitive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself), and LESS is concise. The LESS learning curve is gentle, and the payoff is huge. 

## Open Source

Jekyll is available under the open source [MIT License](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE). That's free-as-in beer and also free-as-in-speech.
