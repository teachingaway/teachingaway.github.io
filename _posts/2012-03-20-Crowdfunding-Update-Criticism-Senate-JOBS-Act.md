<p class="big-text">After a lull, there has been a lot of movement with crowdfunding in the past weeks. The House re-passed the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr2930pcs/pdf/BILLS-112hr2930pcs.pdf">McHenry Bill</a> inside the larger <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr3606pcs/pdf/BILLS-112hr3606pcs.pdf">Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act</a>. The Senate has taken up the JOBS Act, but substituted the House’s crowdfunding provisions with the Merkley/Brown CROWDFUND ACT (<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s2190is/pdf/BILLS-112s2190is.pdf">S.2190</a>).

[<em>Update: there is now a vote in the Senate today, which even if passed would have to be reconciled with the House version</em>.]

As the more staid congressional chamber, the Senate is naturally more concerned about reigning in the potential for crowdfunding to unleash a flood of online start-up hucksterism.  I try not to be cynical, but the approach the Senate seems to have taken is to create a crowdfunding “exemption”  with so many hoops to jump through that nobody could conceivably commit fraud using it, mainly because nobody will use it. The CROWDFUND ACT calls itself an exemption from securities registration, but really creates its own little microcap-IPO registration regime.

That said, I think there is a way to fix the CROWDFUND ACT and increase its fraud prevention bona-fides at the same time<em>.</em>

<em>[William Carleton (@wac6) has some great comments and suggestions on the bill at </em><a href="http://www.crowdsourcing.org/editorial/crowdfunding-is-white-hot-on-capitol-hill---will-it-survive-the-fire/12564"><em>crowdsourcing.org</em></a><em> as well].</em>

<strong>Ditching the Crowd:  Individual Investment Limits </strong>

The key to crowdfunding is the “crowd”. The crowd has two functions:  breaking up risk into small manageable losses to each investor, and passing as an impartial jury on the worthiness of the investment.

Both the CROWDFUND Act and the House version in the JOBS Act seem to miss this point. By allowing larger individual investments you make the crowd dispensable. The CROWDFUND Act would allow individual investment limits to be the greater of $2000 or 5% of an average person’s annual income or net worth. An average person being anybody whose annual income and net worth is under $100,000. Richer folks could invest up to 10% of their annual income or net worth. The House JOBS Act allows investments of the lesser of $10,000 or 10% of the investor’s annual income.

This isn’t really crowdfunding, and it will open up the potential for fraud and lawsuits. Since you can’t really require hard proof of income or net worth, self-disclosure and certification will be the enforcement mechanism. Enthusiastic investors get imaginative in calculating their net worth and unscrupulous “brokers” or “funding portals” (see below), will encourage such creativity. Greater individual losses will also bring lawsuits when businesses fail (and many will fail).

Income-based investing limits have stuck through all the changes to the various crowdfunding proposals because some people are happy to undermine securities regulation on principal, and others are too stuck in the angel investor/venture capital mindset to imagine anything else. This is almost enough to make me cynical about the whole lawmaking process. Since Democrats are so concerned about fraud, I would have thought they would see the value in setting individual investment limits at a relatively low (e.g. $1000) set amount.  <em>It’s not too late to change</em>.

<strong>Unraveling the Mess of Issuer Requirements</strong>

The CROWDFUND Act is currently a mess of duplicative and confusing regulations. The basic framework is that a company wanting to crowdfund some capital will go to an intermediary, either a broker of a “funding portal,” that will act as a platform for investors to review the company information and handle investments. I believe this is the right approach. An intermediary can afford to have centralized compliance procedures and staff and can guide companies through the offering and disclosure process. Left alone to decide how to run a crowdfunded offering, a lot of start-ups could get themselves in trouble trying figure out what to say (and what not to say) to investors, even with the best intentions.

Unfortunately, the CROWDFUND Act starts off with a basically good concept, but keeps adding on regulations and disclosure requirements until it twists itself in knots and undermines its own structure. As currently drafted, the proposed new Section 4A(b) to the Securities Act provides for a list of issuer requirements, including disclosures to be filed with the SEC and provided to investors. Some of these provisions would surely make life hard and limit usage of the exemption, but ultimately I don’t think they would be impossible to comply with, given some tweaks.

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Financials—Section 4A(b)(3)(D)</span></em>.  This provision requires higher quality financial information to be filed based on the offering amount. The problem is this requires all offerings over $100,000 to have financials reviewed by a public accountant using SEC approved standards and procedures. $100,000 just isn’t a lot of money in the world of capital, and this needs to be raised to something where it becomes economical to have expensive accountants.

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Funding Progress Reports—Section 4A(b)(3)(F)</span></em>.  This provision requires the issuer to provide “<em>regular updates regarding the progress . . . in meeting the target offering amount</em>.” This just doesn’t belong in this Section. Investors who make commitments will want to check-in and see if the funding goal is close. But the drafters overlooked that everything required in this Section also has to be filed with the SEC. If anything, issuers should just file a final notice to the SEC that the offering has closed, without requiring ongoing filings in the meantime. Easy fix. Move this to the funding portal section.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Prospectus—Section 4A(b)(3)(G)</span>. This provision requires that “<em>prior to the sale</em>” all investors are given the “<em>final price</em>”, all required disclosures “<em>in writing</em>”, and a “<em>reasonable opportunity to rescind the commitment</em>.” I am not really sure what this means, but it seems like this is creating some type of final prospectus delivery requirement that has to be provided after the target funding is reached. Even applying the existing rules allowing electronic delivery of information are not adequate; to make this workable for crowdfunding, the disclosures to investors should clearly only be required to be provided on the funding portal’s website. Investors should be given some right to rescind, but his is already covered in the provisions on funding portal requirements.

Whoever thought this Section up was well-intentioned, but wasn’t thinking it through in real-world terms. A better system would be that once investors commit to invest, they would get regular email updates on changes to the issuer’s information and the funding's progress. There could be a final email saying that the funding is about to reach its goal and once it is reached the investor’s funds will be drawn.  Once the target funding goal is reached there has to be some finality to the investors’ commitments or you will be running around in circles trying to close.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Annual Reports—Section 4A(b)(6)</span>.  This provision requires an issuer to provide “<em>results of operations and financial statement</em>” to the SEC and investors no less than annually.  This effectively turns the crowdfunding exemption into a microcap IPO registration regime.  The SEC is allowed to limit this requirement, but any ongoing SEC reporting requirement at all is just not workable. How many small companies produce or can afford to pay somebody to produce complex SEC standard “<em>results of operations</em>.”  This can be fixed easily by just changing this to a straightforward requirement that the issuer make financial statements available to investors.

<strong>Funding Portal Regulation </strong>

The CROWDFUND Act requires all crowdfunding offerings to be conducted through a registered broker or a new type of entity called a “funding portal.”  This creates a split between offerings conducted by a broker and those through a funding portal, and would seem to put existing brokers at a distinct and unwanted advantage, which I don’t think the drafters intended.

For example, an important part of fraud protection is in the definition of “funding portal”, which is defined in part as an entity that does not, among other things, “<em>solicit purchases, sales, or offers to buy the securities offered or displayed on its website or portal</em>.” This is a good provision, preventing the nightmare visions of boiler-room cold calling and twitter spamming. After all, it is the bad behavior of old-school stock-promoting boiler rooms that most critics have in mind when they trash the crowdfunding concept. The crowdfunding rules should encourage issuer-neutral platforms to flourish, because these platforms have a reputational interest in vetting the start-up company issuers that use them.

The problem is brokers don’t seem to be subject to these same restrictions. I think the easy fix is just eliminating the broker option in Section 4A(a) and require all crowdfunding to be through the new funding portals.

<em>Other quick fixes to funding portal requirements</em>:
<ul>
	<li>Eliminate the background history checks on all officers, directors and major shareholders as determined by the SEC. This isn’t practical and won’t stop any actual fraud. Let funding portals set their own standards; just require the company principals to certify that they have not been indicted, convicted, or sanctioned for past securities fraud.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Clear up which party is doing the SEC filing. Right now, the funding portal has to “<em>make available</em>” to the SEC all the issuer information 21 days before a sale. I think this can be cleared up by indicating that the issuer has to file with the SEC, the funding portal just makes it publicly available. Probably need to throw in some immunity provisions for funding portals so they can provide guidance and rely on information as disclosed by the company without becoming liable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Loosen the restrictions on other activities by funding portals.  As drafted, funding portals are only permitted to engage in the business of effecting crowdfunded offering. This is short-sighted. A funding portal should also be able to engage in other related types of crowdfunding (e.g. donations, charity fund-raising), other private offerings, and establish related businesses to help manage investors and shareholders on an ongoing basis (e.g. notices, transfers, dividends, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<strong>Things the CROWDFUND Act gets Right</strong>

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exclusion from Shareholder Cap</span></em>.  Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act is amended to provide that the SEC will by rule “conditionally or unconditionally” exclude crowdfunded securities from the 500 shareholder limit for private companies. The JOBS Act has a similar provision, but is a hack fix that defines “held of record” to not include crowdfunded securities.  I don’t know if somebody in the Senate read my last <a href="http://adlervermillion.com/blog/crowdfunding-senate-v-house-advantage-senate/#more-119">blog post</a>, but I suggested this new approach and am happy to see the CROWDFUND Act adopt it.

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">State Preemption of Covered Securities</span></em>.  The House JOBS Act is still blissfully ignoring the problem of state notice filings. Simply deeming a crowdfunded security a “covered security” isn’t enough.   The CROWDFUND Act nicely keeps Senator Brown’s limit on permitted state notice filings under Section 18(c) of the Securities Act to the issuer’s home state and the state where more than 50% of the investor reside. This is essential because otherwise, each state would have a different requirement as to required filings and associated fees.

Those are my thoughts and suggestions, take them or leave them.  Thanks to Zeke for comments.
