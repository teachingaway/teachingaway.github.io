Trademark rights are automatically granted to anyone who uses a distinctive brand to sell a product or service. These automatic rights (called "common law" rights) are basic and limited. For big league trademark rights, you need to register your trademark with the US Patent and Trademark Office (which I will just call the "Trademark Office").

There is nothing inherently complicated about the trademark application process. The Trademark Office just collects some basic information about the trademark, about the trademark owner, and about how the owner uses the trademark to sell its goods or services. Sadly, the Trademark Office complicates this process with a tangle of confusing forms and baffling instructions. Their design philosophy is "more but worse." 

This walkthrough tries to make sense of the USPTO's trademark application process.  This guide is short, and its mostly pictures. The official Trademark Office manual (the "TMEP") weighs in at 1500 pages. As you'd  expect, I'm glossing over some details. If your brand is important, hire an experienced trademark attorney.[^1]

## Trademark Law Basics: The Branding and the Product

Learning a little trademark law will help you put together a stronger trademark application. The Trademark Office rejects applications for two major reasons: 

1. _Likelihood of Confusion_ -  The Trademark Office will refuse applications for trademarks that are too similar to existing trademark registrations. 

2. _Distinctiveness_ - The Trademark Office will refuse applications for trademarks that define or closely describe your product. 

To understand these rules, we need to understand that a trademark has two components: the branding and the product (or service) being sold. 
 
**Likelihood of Confusion.** The Trademark Office will compare your trademark to its database of existing trademark registrations. If your trademark is too similar to an existing registration, it gets rejected. This comparison considers two factors: the brand and the product. Your trademark should only be refused if the brand, as used on your product, is so similar to an existing brand-as-used-on-product that the average consumer is likely to confuse your product for the older product. This is called the "likelihood of confusion" test, and it involves lots of complicated legal considerations that I'll save for a later discussion.

**Distinctiveness.** A trademark should be "distinctive" as opposed to merely "descriptive" or worse - "generic."  Generic words are words that define a particular product. Trademark Law does not protect these words. Instead, they are kept in the public domain. Every coffee shop can use the word "coffee" in its marketing. The Trademark Office will not grant anyone exclusive trademark rights in such a generic term. If you apply for a trademark that defines - or even closely describes - a product, the Trademark Office will reject your application.  

This is not only the law, its good branding. A distinctive trademark makes an impression, while a generic trademark is quickly forgotten.

## The Trademark Application Process

If you have your unique, distinctive mark, and you started using it to sell your product, you are ready to apply for a trademark registration. First, go to the <a title="USPTO Trademark Application" href="http://www.uspto.gov/teas/teasplus.htm">USPTO's Trademark Application</a> page. You should see the impenetrable wall of text pictured below.

<a href="/images/tm-app/1-pick-teas-plus.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/1-pick-teas-plus.png" class="big-image"></a>

Pick "TEAS Plus." "TEAS" is some trademark Office acronym that doesn't matter.  "TEAS Plus" is the version that saves you $50, but limits your options for describing your goods and services.

Click continue to be whisked away to a new and different page of convoluted warnings and instructions.

## Lawyer or DIY Application? 

All you need to do on this page is pick whether an attorney is filling out the form or not. 

<a href="/images/tm-app/2-is-attorney-filing-trademark.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/2-is-attorney-filing-trademark.png" class="big-image"></a>

**Time Limit** - This form will self destruct in 60 minutes. You can save your work for later by clicking "download portable data" on the "validation" page at the very end of the process (although you can't get to the very end until you finish filling out the form - UX catch 22!). This "portable data" button at the validation page will download a wonky xml file that you can upload again at this start page. 

Click continue, and you will see an ugly data entry form.

## Trademark Owner 

Here, you enter some info about the trademark owner. If the owner is a company that has parents, subsidiaries, or licensees, you should talk to a lawyer. Entering the wrong owner can cause problems.



<a href="/images/tm-app/3-trademark-owner.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/3-trademark-owner.png" class="big-image"></a>

Note that this page asked for info about the trademark _owner_. Later in the process, you will see a very similar form asking for info about the _contact person_.

## The Trademark Itself

Trademark registrations can protect one of two aspects of a mark - protection as a word-mark or as a design-mark. The plaintext word  protects the word (or short phrase or slogan) in any font and in any color. The design mark protects either a specific stylized version of a word, and can also protect a logo or design without any words in it at all. (Really more than these 2 - including sounds, product packaging, colors, smells, animations and more - but for an intro guide, let's focus on the big 2 - trademark registration can protect a plain text word or a logo/design). 

If the trademark is plain text, pick Standard Character. Plain text trademark registrations provide stronger trademark rights, but are more likely to be rejected by office actions. Plain text registration are generally stronger - they protect your trademark in every font, every color, and in any design.  Since they are broader rights, they are more likely to be rejected by the trademark office as being too similar to existing trademark registrations. 

If your trademark includes a logo, image, particular font, then pick "Special Form." You might want to file two trademarks - one for the plain-text words and another for the stylized words or logo. 

Note: If the trademark includes any letters at all, type them into the box. Trademark law doesn't care much about capitalization or punctuation.

<a href="/images/tm-app/4-standard-character-trademark.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/4-standard-character-trademark.png" class="big-image"></a>

Pro tip: claim your logo as _colorless_ even if it includes particular colors. Colorless actually means every color. If you claim a color, your registration is limited to that particular color. A "special form" trademark should be easier to register, but the resulting trademark rights are less extensive than the plain-text option. If you pick "special form", you will be asked to upload a .jpg of your trademark.

## Adding Goods and Services

Now we come to yet another page of complicated warnings. Click "Add Goods/Services." This will take us to a separate page  for selecting appropriate goods and services. 

<a href="/images/tm-app/5-add-goods.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/5-add-goods.png" class="big-image"></a>

## Searching for Goods and Services

Now we're at a search box for the list of pre-approved "TEAS Plus" descriptions of goods and service. Describing your goods and services is tricky.  If the description is too broad, it can void your trademark. If its too narrow you may have trouble stopping infringers. 

Before searching, try to identify the "class" of goods and services applicable to your trademark. The trademark ["International Class"](http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/notices/international.jsp) system tries to categorize all possible goods and services into 45 classes. 

Remember that the USPTO charges a fee of about $300 per class, as well as renewal fees per class.

## Selecting Goods and Services from the List

When viewing the results, be sure the description is in the rights class. You can pick several descriptions, as long as they accurate describe your goods or services. The USPTO charges additional fees per "class" but not for multiple descriptions within a class.

## Filing Basis

Every trademark needs a "filing basis." Think of the filing basis as the reason why you're entitled to a trademark registration. The two filing bases we will discuss here are called "use in commerce" [§1(a)] and "intent to use" [§1(b)]. The other filing basis relate to international trademarks. 
 
Pick §1(a) if you already use the trademark in interstate commerce. That is, you already use this trademark to sell some product or service in more than one US state. 

Pick §1(b) if you don't use the trademark to sell anything yet, but you plan to start soon.


<a href="/images/tm-app/8-assign-filing-basis.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/8-assign-filing-basis.png" class="big-image"></a>

If you selected §1(a) (use in commerce), you will be asked to provide a .jpg image showing how you use the trademark in commerce. The Trademark Office wants some evidence that you are truly using the trademark to sell something. This will be the next step.

If you selected §1(b), you will end up with an "intent to use" registration. This registration is a placeholder. It will not provide full trademark rights until you file a "statement of use" with the Trademark Office. There is a time limit. You must file the statement of use within 6 months after your intent-to-use registration issues. You can extend this deadline for up to 3 additional 6-month periods by paying extension fees. This guide does not cover the §1(b) intent-to-use trademark application process.

## Specimen of Use

If you are already using your trademark (and picked 1(a) above), you need to upload a .jpg that shows how you use the trademark. 



For goods,upload a picture of the trademark on the actual product.  You can use a screen-shot of your website, but only if it shows a "buy now" or "Purchase" button.

For services, upload an advertisement.

<a href="/images/tm-app/9-filing-basis-specimen.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/9-filing-basis-specimen.png" class="big-image"></a>

## Upload the Specimen of Use

On this page, you will upload a jpg of your specimen of use. The image should be smaller than 900px square, but big enough to show the trademark being used to sell your product or service. 

<a href="/images/tm-app/10-attach-specimen-of-use-in-commerce.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/10-attach-specimen-of-use-in-commerce.png" class="big-image"></a>

After you upload the image, click "return to application" (did you even know you left the application??).  

- - - 

## Date of First Use

Next you will input the "date of first use" of the trademark. There are two - first use *in commerce*, and first use *anywhere*. Its critical that you get the date of first use in commerce correct. If its an old trademark, and you don't have the exact launch date, input the month and year. 

For goods in the same class, you can assign filing bases in a batch. If the goods are in different classes, each class needs to be assigned a filing basis separately. 

Click "assign filing basis" at the bottom, and you will be returned to the "Basis for Filing" screen once again. 

<a href="/images/tm-app/11-date-of-first-use.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/11-date-of-first-use.png" class="big-image"></a>

## Back to the Basis for Filing Screen


You have now described your goods and services, and assigned a filing basis for each class. The final steps are easier. You need to enter your contact info, sign the application (swearing that its contents are accurate), and pay the USPTO fee ($275 per class). 

After every line is assigned its filing basis, click continue. 

<a href="/images/tm-app/12-basis-assigned.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/12-basis-assigned.png" class="big-image"></a>

## Enter Correspondence Info.

You entered "owner info" earlier, this time you are entering the contact info for the person who should receive Trademark Office notifications related to this application.

<a href="/images/tm-app/13-correspondence-info.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/13-correspondence-info.png" class="big-image"></a>

## Sign the Application 

Pick "sign directly." Sign your name by typing it between two slashes like this: /Osbert Sitwell/

<a href="/images/tm-app/14-sign-declaration.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/14-sign-declaration.png" class="big-image"></a>

Click "Validate". Don't click "add signatory" unless you want to add a <em>second</em> signer.

## Pay the Filing Fee

Submit payment and you're done.


<a href="/images/tm-app/16-pay-uspto-fee.png"><img src="/images/tm-app/16-pay-uspto-fee.png" ></a>


## What to Expect After You Submit

The USPTO sends an immediate confirmation email. Then, about 3 months later, a Trademark Examining Attorney will review your application and send you an "office action." If the office action is an approval, your trademark will probably register in 2 more months, and the Trademark Office will mail you an official looking document with a shiny gold seal. If the office action is a refusal, you will receive an email explaining the reasons for the rejection. You will have 6 months to respond to the refusal by either amending the application or pointing out any errors in the Trademark Office's reasons for rejecting the application.
