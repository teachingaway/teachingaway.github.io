I've been tempted to buy a Pioneer A4 since Wirecutter named it the <a title="Best Airplay Speaker" href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-airplay-speaker/" target="_blank">best airplay speaker</a>. Last week, I broke down and bought one. It was easy to set up and has  decent sound for $150. The A4 seems to be living up to the hype.

Oddly, despite the positive reviews, Pioneer recently stopped making the A4, and there's no replacement. Why kill off a well-received product? I'm wondering if Bose's active patent assertion in the iPhone/dock/airplay market is somehow related. 

<img class=" wp-image-572 alignright" alt="bose v. ihome patents" src="/../images/bose-v.-ihome-patents-hand.jpg" />

Bose is currently suing Memorex and SDI, alleging that 144 models of their speaker systems infringe <a title="Bose Patent" href="https://www.google.com/patents/US20130158693" target="_blank">Bose patent no. 7,277,765</a>. The Bose patent, filed in 2000, is essentially for a type of speaker system that connects to a digital media player. SDI makes the popular "iHome" line of speakers, which seem to be cheaper versions of various Bose speakers. iHome is getting good reviews (I almost bought SDI's iHome "<a title="iHome iW1" href="http://www.amazon.com/iHome-iW1-AirPlay-Wireless-Rechargeable/dp/B005XTBWQY/r" target="_blank">iW1</a>" speaker instead of the Pioneer).

The case is not going well for Bose. In 2012, Bose lost on a major claim construction issue, and the Federal Circuit just affirmed (March 2014). Bose claimed that 144 speaker systems from Memorex and SDI were infringing its '765 patent. This '765 patent claims something about connecting a media device to a speaker system.

I couldn't figure out exactly what the innovation was in the Bose ’765 patent, but for this case, it doesn't matter. Bose lost on claim construction.

The relevant claims all included an "interface" element. Bose wanted "interface" to just mean "connection", while the defendants wanted "interface" to mean a "connection with a digital to analog converter." This definition was a big deal because only 1 out of the 144 accused speakers had a digital-audio-converter. If the patent required a digital-audio-converter, then 143 of the products are not infringing, based on this fact alone.

Judge Clevenger ruled for the defendants, finding that Bose's claim was limited to speaker systems <em>with</em> a digital-audio-converter. Clevenger relied on 2 of the standard claim construction rules:

<strong>Prosecution History</strong>. During prosecution, Bose amended the language of its original claim 1 from "connection" to "interface." The Court wasn't excited about Bose's argument that "interface" should still be defined as "connection."

<strong>The Specification</strong>. "A reading of the specification further shows that, as used within the asserted patent, 'connection' refers to physical linkages while 'interface' is reserved for linkages that perform data conversion. As properly pointed out in the Appellees’ brief, 'interface' is used in the specification only with reference to the 'embodiment in which a computer is outputting a digital signal to a speaker requiring an analog signal.'”

A handful of Bose claims survived this Federal Circuit appeal, but I expect Bose will quickly settle the case. This narrowing claim construction will follow Bose to future cases, if it decides to assert the same patent against other speaker systems. But I suspect Bose has a hefty arsenal of related patents it can draw from if it needs to.

Does this mean that the Pioneer A4 will come back on the market? I kinda doubt it. But it would be nice to see more high-quality Airplay speakers.

I don't to knock Bose. I like a lot of their speakers, and I listen to most of my music on Bose QuietComfort15 headphones. But sometimes I worry that Bose products come with a steep markup to cover their marketing and legal budget.
