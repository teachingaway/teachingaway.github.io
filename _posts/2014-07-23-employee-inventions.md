When does a company own the rights to its employee's code or inventions?  When can an employee spin off a side project without messy entanglements from her former company? These can be complicated questions. If there's a written invention assignment contract, it will generally be enforceable and  drastically simplify the answers. Without a written contract, the answers are buried in a mess of ambiguous state and federal laws.

### Takeaway for Founders

Have all your employees sign a contract with a IP assignment agreement. Special rules apply in California and Washington State. 

The contract doesn't need to be draconian, it just needs to spell out the details. Encouraging employees to work on creative side projects can be great for innovation. 

Review all of your co-founders IP agreements with previous companies. Learn from [Paul Graham's mistakes](http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html),

> As we were in the middle of getting bought, we discovered that one of our people had, early on, been bound by an agreement that said all his ideas belonged to the giant company that was paying for him to go to grad school. In theory, that could have meant someone else owned big chunks of our software. So the acquisition came to a screeching halt while we tried to sort this out. The problem was, since we'd been about to be acquired, we'd allowed ourselves to run low on cash. Now we needed to raise more to keep going. But it's hard to raise money with an IP cloud over your head, because investors can't judge how serious it is.


### Takeaway for Employees: 
First, double-check your employment agreement and the company's employment policies. There may be enforceable IP assignment agreements in either. If there isn't an applicable IP assignment provision, (a) you probably own the patents to your inventions, and (b) if the project is unrelated to your employer's business, you probably also own the copyright to your side-projects code.

1. Ideally, discuss your side-project with your company, and get their approval in writing. This is the only sure-fire method of owning your own side-project IP. 
2. If you're not confident the company will give permission, perhaps its better not to tip them off about your side-project. However, working in secret runs the risk of a future ownership battle, where the rules of the arena are complicated, and a well-funded company will have the upper hand.  
3. Never work on your side-project during work hours, never use a work computer, never rely on company code, servers or technology. 
4. A side-project that directly competes with your employer or that siphons off customers is more likely to start a lawsuit, and you're more likely to lose it. If you're not stealing customers away from your old company, there's a good chance they don't care about your new project. 
5. Review any non-compete clause. In California, you can probably ignore it. In New York, its probably enforceable, but only in a limited fashion.

Now lets dig into the law. The default ownership rules for patents and copyrights are different. Without a specific IP assignment clause, employees own the patents on their own inventions. But a company will own the copyright to its employee's creative works (including software code), as long as the work was done "within the scope" of employment. 


## Patent Law

> _The law on patent ownership is unacceptably complex and creates excessive uncertainty_. -Prof. Donald Chisum.

The general rule is that inventors own their own inventions. "The presumptive owner of the property right in a patentable invention is the single human inventor" [_Stanford v. Roche_, 131 S. Ct. 2188 (2011)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14519543602869990622). This rule is different from the rest of employment law, where a company generally owns the results of its employee's work. "No one would claim that an autoworker who builds a car while working in a factory owns that car. But, as noted, patent law has always been different: We have rejected the idea that mere employment is sufficient to vest title to an employee's invention in the employer." [_Stanford v. Roche_, 131 S. Ct. 2188 (2011)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14519543602869990622). 

Employees own their own inventions unless: (a) they signed a contract transferring inventions to the company, (b) they were expressly hired to "invent" solutions to company problems, or (c) they are an officer or director with "fiduciary duty" to the company. As the Federal Circuit put it: 

> “The general rule is that an individual owns the patent rights to the subject matter of which he is an inventor, even though he conceived it or reduced it to practice in the course of his employment. There are two exceptions to this rule: first, an employer owns an employee’s invention if the employee is a party to an express contract to that effect; second, where an employee is hired to invent something or solve a particular problem, the property of the invention related to this effort may belong to the employer. Both exceptions are firmly grounded in the principles of contract law that allow parties to freely structure their transactions and obtain the benefit of any bargains reached.” [_Banks v. Unisys Corp_., 228 F.3d 1357, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2000)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9217281422671286444). 

**Hired to Invent.** Even without a contract, a company will own an employees patents if the employee was "hired to invent." The exact standard here is difficult to pin down. "Hired to invent" requires something more than merely being hired to "make improvements." Likewise, a fancy job title like "Chief Engineer" does not necessarily mean an employee was "hired to invent."  If you're a founder, never assume that any of your employee's were "hired to invent" anything. Instead, have them sign a written IP assignment agreement. 

**Shop Right.** Even if the company is not the owner of an employee invention, the company may have a "shop right." That is, the company may have an automatic no-cost license to use the employee invention. Again, founders should never rely on vague "shop rights" when they can easily have employee's sign a written IP assignment agreement. 


### California and Washington State Law on Employee Inventions

San Francisco and Seattle startups take note: special state laws apply. [California Labor Code § 2870](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&group=02001-03000&file=2870-2872) limits the types of inventions that an employee can be forced to turn over. [Washington State law](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=49.44.140) is similar. 

In CA and WA, regardless of what an employment contract says, employees will retain ownership of their inventions under certain circumstances. 

1. If the invention is made entirely on employee's own time, the employee owns it. 
2. If the invention is made without using any of the company's equipment or technology, the employee owns it. 

There are two exceptions. A contract assigning inventions to the company is enforceable if: 

1. The invention relates to the company's business or anticipated R&D, or 
2. the invention results from work performed by the employee "as an employee" of the company.

Finally, companies need to tell their new employees about the law. A copy of [California Labor Code § 2870](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&group=02001-03000&file=2870-2872) should be attached to all employment agreements.

## Copyright Law
Copyright ownership is controlled by federal law, so the rules are the same in every state. The default copyright rules are similar to the default patent rules. By default, authors own the copyright to all of their creative works, including any code they write. But as always, there are exceptions. 

A company owns the copyright to "works made for hire." This includes (a) any work made by an employee "within the scope of her employment" and (b) the work of an independent contractor if the company gets an express written assignment. 

"Work for hire" is defined in 17 USC § 101. For an _employee_, any work created "within the scope of his or her employment" is work for hire and owned by the company. For an independent contractor, certain types of creative works are "work for hire" if there a written "work for hire" agreement. Other types of works created by independent contractors (including code) can never be "work for hire." For these types of work, there should be a separate copyright assignment clause. There is a subtle difference between proper "work for hire" and plain copyright assignment. But understanding the difference is much less important than remembering to get a written IP assignment agreement when hiring an employee or independent contractor. Federal law requires all copyright assignments to be in writing. 17 USC §204.

## Non-Compete Agreements


Non-compete agreements are [becoming more common](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/business/noncompete-clauses-increasingly-pop-up-in-array-of-jobs.html?_r=0), even in technology startups. In California, non-compete agreements are generally unenforceable. In New York, the rules are more complicated.  

New York allows non-competes, but only to the extent necessary to protect the company's "legitimate business interests." What does that mean? In practice, it means you end up in front of a Judge in the New York State Commercial Division on very short notice (the legal filing will be called a "Temporary Restraining Order" and may be followed by a "Preliminary Injunction" hearing). If you took secrets from your old company and used them to compete against the company, you're probably in trouble. The leading NY case is [BDO Seidman v. Hirshberg, 712 NE 2d 1220 (N.Y. 1999).](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9875117510352576316) 

But your former employer can't stop you from using your general skills and knowledge, even to compete with your old company. New York has a strong public policy favoring employee mobility and free enterprise. After "the term of an employment agreement has expired, the general public policy favoring robust and uninhibited competition should not give way merely because a particular employer wishes to insulate himself from competition." [_American Broadcasting Companies v. Wolf_, 52 N.Y.2d 394, 404 (N.Y. 1981)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10568205195362534065). There are also "powerful considerations of public policy which militate against sanctioning the loss of a man's livelihood." _Id_.

## Side Projects Encourage Innovative Startup Culture
Startups should have a side-project policy. Whether allowed or prohibited, the rules should be written out clearly, and in plain language. 

As founders, you may want to encourage your employees to work on side projects. Intelligent and creative people will have side projects anyway, so they might as well be out in the open. 

Generous side-project policies can attract top engineering talent. Side-projects encourage creativity and experimentation. They add variety to an employee's routine and can reduce burnout, while simultaneously improving employee skills (all at no cost to the company!). Side projects can also improve your employee's network, which might help you hire new developers. 

Gmail famously came from Google's 20% time to tinker policy. And while Google quietly terminated 20% time last year, other companies have picked up the torch. Check out [LinkedIn's Incubator](http://www.wired.com/2012/12/llinkedin-20-percent-time/), [Apple's BlueSky](http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-tries-20-time-2012-11), and [Microsoft's Garage](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/stories/garage/index.html)
