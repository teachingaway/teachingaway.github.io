PACER, the public archive of court filings and decisions, recently [deleted](https://www.pacer.gov/announcements/general/webpacer.html) thousands of documents. PACER's excuse is that these records use a legacy database schema that is incompatible with the new database architecture.  

> As a result of these architectural changes, the locally developed legacy case management systems in the five courts listed below are now incompatible with PACER; therefore, the judiciary is no longer able to provide electronic access to the closed cases on those systems.

This doesn't make sense. Database schema changes are annoying, sure. Its the type of work that might waste an afternoon or two. But its not the type of insurmountable challenge that justifies deleting thousands of public court documents.  

Public.Resource.org has [offered](https://law.resource.org/pacer/ca2.uscourts.gov.20140827.pdf) to digitize and serve these lost court cases. I sent a letter (below) to Judge Katzmann, Chief Judge of the Second Circuit, encouraging him to accept Public.Resource's offer.

<p>Honorable Robert A. Katzmann, Chief Judge<br>
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <br>
Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse<br>
40 Foley Square<br>
New York, NY 10007</p>


**Re: Removal of Public Records from PACER**


Chief Judge Katzmann:

PACER recently removed public access to records of Second Circuit cases filed before January 1, 2010. This is a step backwards. These records include the briefs and motions written by some of the finest lawyers in the country. The Second Circuit should proudly display these documents online, not hide them away in a dusty basement

Eliminating digital access will deprive young attorneys and law students of the opportunity to learn from an exemplary body of work. Eliminating digital access will increase the cost of legal representation and the cost of *pro bono* representation in particular. Please don’t let it happen. 

I encourage you to consider [Public.Resource.org’s letter of August 27, 2014](https://law.resource.org/pacer/ca2.uscourts.gov.20140827.pdf), and their generous offer to return the Second Circuit’s public records to the internet. I believe Public.Resource.org has the experience and technical expertise to properly screen the records for personal information, and to provide free digital access.  

I am not affiliated with Public.Resource.org, and I write only on my own behalf. 


Regards, 

Eric Adler

## Link Roundup:

[Public.Resource.org ](https://law.resource.org/pacer/ca2.uscourts.gov.20140827.pdf) has offered to scrub the personal information from these documents and host them for free. Courts would be foolish not to accept this offer.
