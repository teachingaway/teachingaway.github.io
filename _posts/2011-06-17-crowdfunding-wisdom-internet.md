<p class="big-text">The internet has freed many innovators and creators from the arbitrary and capricious ways of old school industry gatekeepers by allowing direct access to consumers. In its purest most idealized form, the internet allows an idea to be judged according to its value and not its prepackaged form.  It may be in practice that brilliance is drowned out by the sheer volume of the internet’s content or its relentless impatience, but it is far better than what we had before.</p>

The internet’s potential, however, is being passed over when it comes to the one of most significant hurdles any entrepreneur will face—raising capital. When it comes time for your startup to raise seed or angel financing, the gatekeepers of capital remain to stand in judgment of your vision’s potential. The SEC has until recently remained firm in the conviction that raising private financing through public solicitation of investors, such as internet crowdfunding, poses too great of a risk to allow it, except under narrow state regulated exceptions.

Regardless, a couple of brave operators have entered the crowdfunding space (<a href="https://www.profounder.com/">Profounder</a> and <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">IndieGoGo</a>, to name two) and have staked out a crowdfunding model that is either just holding the line or just over it on exempt private securities offerings. Profounder’s model works within the narrow band of state exceptions and IndieGoGo relies on a non-investment (i.e. non-security) financing vehicle.

But, this isn’t the end of the crowdfunding story.  Recently the SEC has shown a willingness to reconsider the restrictions on public solicitation. In an <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/schapiro-issa-letter-040611.pdf">April 6, 2011 letter to congress</a>, the chairwoman of the SEC, Mary Shapiro, indicated that her SEC staff was considering proposals to allow a limited crowdfunding exception that would allow startups to raise up to $100,000 in maximum individual investments of $100. The recently released SEC <a href="http://sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor29.pdf">final report from the November 2010 Forum on Small Business Capital Formation</a> also discussed the possibility of creating a new exemption from the general solicitation prohibition. This recommendation ranked second in importance to the participants in the forum.   

Both these actions would be a great start to opening up opportunities for startups to reach the capital markets through the internet and its wise ways.
