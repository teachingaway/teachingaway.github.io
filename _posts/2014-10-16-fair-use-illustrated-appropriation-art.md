<p class="big-text">Copyright protects the creative <em>expression</em> of an idea, but never the <em>idea itself</em>. Copying ideas is always allowed, but copying expression may not be. However, copying expression is allowed if the copy is "fair use." Exploring video game and appropriation art cases can help solidify these nebulous concepts. </p>

Copyright protects creative expression, but not ideas. Lawyers and pedants call this the **idea/expression dichotomy.** The policy of free ideas is so powerful that if the idea and its expression are inseparable, then the expression must also remain free. We call this the **merger rule**. Also, copyright does not protect cliches. Lawyers call this the **scenes a faire** doctrine. 

Let's look at video games first. We know that *ideas* can't be copyrighted, by the *creative expression* of an idea can. For example, the idea of a karate style fighting game can't be copyrighted, as we'll see in both the Karate Champ case and the Street Fighter II case. But first, let's start with a case about Atari's Breakout game and the bare minimum of creative expression necessary to support a copyright. 



## Video Games are Copyrightable: Breakout

When Atari applied to register its copyright in Breakout, the Copyright Office refused, denigrating Breakout as mere shapes and colors, and found "no original authorship in either the selection or arrangement of the images or their components." Harsh words. Atari turned to a young Ruth Bader-Ginsburg for relief. Ginsburg appreciated the creativity inherent in video games, and ordered the Copyright Office to give Atari its due. 

<img src="/images/copyright/atari-breakout-copyrightable-subject-matter-ginsburg.png/" class="medium-image">

First, Judge Ginsburg notes that while simple shapes and colors are not copyrightable, the *selection and arrangement* of simple shapes is copyrightable, especially when paired with sound effects. Next, she notes that the Breakout game mechanics are governed by creative physics rules: 
 
 > The ball's path in Breakout varies depending on which of four sections of the paddle it hits. Its trajectory does not follow from the laws of physics. [*Atari v. Oman*, 979 F.2d 242 (DC CA 1992)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11202168367195629653).

Judge Ginsburg concludes that Breakout includes the types of creative expression that merits copyright protection, and cajoles the Copyright Office into approving Atari's copyright registration. 

 > The abstract representation in Breakout is neither an "obvious" nor an "inevitable" choice. Nor is the coordination of a square "ball" and a rectangular shrinking paddle a "time-honored" or "conventional" combination. The same may be said of the choice of colors, the placement and design of the scores, the changes in speed, the use of sounds, and the synchronized graphics and sounds which accompany the ball's bounces behind the wall. [*Atari v. Oman*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11202168367195629653)(edited for length).

**Takeaway**: While Breakout is a game of simple shapes and rules, the combination and arrangement of those shapes and rules was sufficiently creative to merit copyright protection, especially because the rules were based in fictional physics. On the other hand, games that rely more heavily on the laws of physics, like many realistic sports games, may merit weaker copyright protection.

## Video Games Clones

Since copyright only protects *creative* expression, the video game clones that only copy *utilitarian* expression get off scot free. When looking for similarities between the clone and the original, we need to mentally "filter out" unprotectable expression like game mechanics (utilitarian expression) and stock video game elements ("scenes-a-faire"). This isn't easy to do, so let's see how it plays out in lawsuits involving video game classics like Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Karate Champ, Street Fighter II and Tetris. 

<hr class="invisible">

<img src="/images/copyright/donkey-kong-v-crazy-kong-clone-copyright-infringement.png/" class="medium-image">

## Crazy Kong: Infringement

Elcon made a straight-up Donkey Kong clone called "Crazy Kong." Crazy Kong "embodies audio-video material (including the characters on the screen and the sound) that is virtually identical" to the Donkey Kong video game. [*Nintendo v. Elcon Industries*, 564 F. Supp. 937 (ED Mich 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14413211357527714092). Nintendo's Donkey Kong is full of creative expression. Crazy Kong didn't just copy game mechanics, it copied everything, including Donkey Kong's protectable creative expression. Crazy Kong is plain vanilla copyright infringement.

More interesting copyright cases involve clones that at least make an effort to differentiate themselves from the originals. 

<hr class="tall">

<img src="/images/copyright/kc-munchkin-copyright-infringement.jpg/" class="medium-image">

## K.C. Munchkin: Infringement

A video game copying Pac-Man’s design and game play was copyright infringement:

> The K. C. Munchkin gobbler has several blatantly similar features, including the relative size and shape of the “body,” the V-shaped “mouth,” its distinctive gobbling action (with appropriate sounds), and especially the way in which it disappears upon being captured. An examination of the K. C. Munchkin ghost monsters reveals even more significant visual similarities. In size, shape, and manner of movement, they are virtually identical to their PAC-MAN counterparts. K. C. Munchkin’s monsters, for example, exhibit the same peculiar “eye” and “leg” movement. Both games, moreover, express the role reversal and “regeneration” process with such great similarity that an ordinary observer could conclude only that North American copied plaintiffs’ PAC-MAN. [*Atari v. Philips*, 672 F.2d 607 (7th Cir. 1982)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16433139020722034724).

Let's compare Pac-Man, a maze game with fictional characters, to a sports game rooted in non-fiction themes and physics. 

<hr class="tall">

<img src="/images/copyright/karate-champ-no-copyright-infringement.png/" class="medium-image">

## No Infringement of Karate Champ

"World Karate Championship" is a clone, more or less, of "Karate Champ." The two games were very similar graphics and game play, but unlike Crazy Kong, World Karate Championship was not an identical clone. And unlike KC Munchkin, it copied elements from the original game that were patterned on the real-life sport of Karate. 

Data East had trouble enforcing its copyright because because copyright protects a video game's creative expression, not the parts that necessarily flow from the idea of a karate match. For example, Data East could not protect the idea of a "squatting reverse punch wherein the heel is not on the ground." 

The court first discussed the "merger" rule. Copyright protects expression, but never ideas, which must remain free. When an idea and its expression are inseparable, the merger rule frees both for the public domain. The elements copied from Karate Champ
 
 > consist of the game procedure, common karate moves, the idea of background scenes, a time element, a referee, computer graphics, and bonus points, result from either constraints inherent in the sport of karate or computer restraints. After careful consideration and viewing of these features, we find that they necessarily follow from the idea of a martial arts karate combat game, or are inseparable from, indispensable to, or even standard treatment of the idea of the karate sport. As such, they are not protectable. [*Data East v. Epyx*, 862 F.2d 204 (9th Cir. 1988)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5941890015361159855).
 

As a result, there was no copyright infringement.  Epyx copied only the "idea" of a Karate video game, and the non-copyrightable graphics and game mechanics that necessarily flowed from that idea.  [*Data East v. Epyx*, 862 F.2d 204 (9th Cir. 1988)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5941890015361159855). 

Now let's look at a clone of Street Fighter II - a fighting game with a much looser basis in reality than World Karate.  

<hr class="tall">

<img src="/images/copyright/capcom-v-data-east-no-copyright-infringment-street-fighter.jpg/" class="medium-image">

## No Infringement of Street Fighter II 

The creative elements of video games merit stronger copyright protections than the non-fiction elements. While Fighter's History (right) copied most of its details and game play from Street Fighter II, it was careful not to copy the creative game elements: 

> For example, although Guile and Matlok both have spiky hair and wear similar clothing, they are not identical to one another. Guile is a military figure who wears military garb and has a military base as his home stage. Matlok is a “punkrocker” whose characterization is underscored by his tough appearance and “breakdance” type moves. Their magic projectiles, while similar in appearance, are not identical. In keeping with his personality, Matlok throws a spinning compact disc, the form of which is apparent in some video sequences. Guile, on the other hand, throws a Ch’i mental energy ball and shouts “sonic boom” upon its release. This is in keeping with his military persona. [*CapCom v. Data East* (ND CA 1994)](/capcom-v-data-east/). 


The court also excluded any "scenes-a-faire" elements (i.e., stock elements, cliches, stereotypes) from its copyright analysis:

 > Almost all of the games, for example, have a vitality bar that runs across the top of the video screen and changes color to indicate the percentage of strength the fighter has left. In addition, most of the games contain similar winner designations to indicate which fighter has won the round. Neither these individual features, nor their particular compilation in Street Fighter II are original to Capcom. Rather, they are better viewed as unprotectable scenes-a-faire.... Consequently, they are not entitled to copyright protection. [*CapCom v. Data East* (ND CA 1994)](/capcom-v-data-east/).

Since Fighter's History only copied (a) non-protectable functional game elements, and (b) non-protectable scenes-a-faire, it was not infringing the Street Figher II copyight. Check out [the appendix](/capcom-v-data-east/#appendix) of the case for a detailed copyright analysis of the fighters, special moves and combos.

### Tetris Infringed by Mino

Desiree Golden was an intelligent young woman who founded Xio Interactive, a video game company, soon after college. She did her research before cloning Tetris: 

 > Before releasing its product, Xio researched copyright law, both through its own independent studying and based on advice of counsel... Based on this research, Xio believed it could freely copy any part of Tetris that was based on a "rule of the game" or that Xio viewed as being functional to the game.... After the purportedly careful analysis it undertook to understand copyright law, apparently Xio believed it could engage in wholesale copying of the Tetris look and relate almost every visual element to a "rule," finding none of Tetris's visual expression copyrightable. [*Tetris v. Xio Interactive*, 863 F.Supp.2d 394 (D. NJ 2012). ](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18064882260025243346).

She understood the law, but not how the law applied to Tetris. That is, she didn't correctly identify where the the "rules" of Tetris ended and the creative expression began. To be fair, it's not an easy line to draw. 
 
Here's how the court identified the unprotectable "rules" of Tetris: 

 > Tetris is a puzzle game where a user manipulates pieces composed of square blocks, each made into a different geometric shape, that fall from the top of the game board to the bottom where the pieces accumulate. The user is given a new piece after the current one reaches the bottom of the available game space. While a piece is falling, the user rotates it in order to fit it in with the accumulated pieces. The object of the puzzle is to fill all spaces along a horizontal line. If that is accomplished, the line is erased, points are earned, and more of the game board is available for play. But if the pieces accumulate and reach the top of the screen, then the game is over. These then are the general, abstract ideas underlying Tetris and cannot be protected by copyright nor can expressive elements that are inseparable from them. [*Tetris v. Xio*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18064882260025243346). 

The creative expression of the rules is protectable. The court decided that the style of the pieces and the way they move through space was protectable creative expression: 

 > The style, design, shape, and movement of the pieces are expression; they are not part of the ideas, rules, or functions of the game nor are they essential or inseparable from the ideas, rules, or functions of the game.

Since Mino copied the exact same 7 Tetris shapes, the same board dimensions (10 x 20 blocks) and the way the shapes moved through the board, it infringed the Tetris copyright.

<img src="/images/copyright/dawn-of-the-dead-v-dead-rising-no-copyright-infringement.jpg/" class="medium-image">

## No Infringement of Dawn of the Dead
 
Capcom's Dead Rising game took inspiration from George Romero's 1979 zombie classic "Dawn of the Dead." The court noted several similarities. In both works: (1) the story kicks off with a helicopter ride to a rural mall infested with zombies; (2) the mall has a gun shop; (3) propane tanks and chainsaws are used in creative ways to kill zombies. In addition, both works parody rampant consumerism and critique of sensationalistic journalism. However, these similarities "are driven by the wholly unprotectable concept of humans battling zombies in a mall during a zombie outbreak." *Capcom v. MKR Group*, 2008 WL 4661479 (N.D. Cal. 2008). Since Capcom's video game only copied unprotectable ideas, there was no copyright infringement. 

**Takeaway**: Using chainsaws to kill zombies is scenes-a-faire; its cliche, not creative copyrightable expression. 

<hr class="invisible">

Video game copyright cases tend to turn on whether the game components are creative (protectable) vs. functional (public domain) or scenes-a-faire (public domain). Appropriation art cases, on the other hand, often depend on whether a copy is "fair use."  

<hr class="tall">


## Appropriation Art and Fair Use

Fair use comes up in many types of copyright cases, but "appropriation art" cases are often the most interesting. In appropriation art cases, some creative expression has been copied, but the copying will not be infringement if the new art *transforms* the original. If the secondary use adds value to the original–if the quoted matter is used as raw material, transformed in the creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings—then it's type of activity that the fair use doctrine protects for the enrichment of society. [Toward a Fair Use Standard, Pierre Leval](http://www.yalelawtech.org/wp-content/uploads/leval.pdf). 

Copyright law doesn’t give us clear-cut rules like “using less than 10% of an original is fair use” or "copying less than 8 seconds of video is OK." The actual fair use rules are subjective and imprecise. Reviewing some examples can help give you a feel for the rules.

## Fair Use: Sorry for Partying

“Sorry for Partying” is an easy win for fair use. “The photograph was posterized, the background was removed, and Soglin’s face was turned lime green and surrounded by multi-colored writing… almost none of the copyrighted work remained.” [*Kienitz v. Sconnie Nation* (7th Cir. 2014)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11576719392718214877).

Sorry for Partying was fair use because it used only a sliver of the original photo. However, fair use isn’t just about the amount of art copied. Fair use weighs four central factors: (1) is the copy transformative or non-commercial? (2) Was the original work factual or creative? (3) How much was copied? (4) Does the copy harm the market for the original work?

Keep these questions in mind as you look at the next images.

## Fair Use: Parody for a Movie Poster

Photoshopping Leslie Nielsen’s face onto the famous photo of a pregnant Demi Moore was fair use as a parody, despite being a commercial movie poster:

> Plainly, the [Nielsen photo] adds something new and qualifies as a “transformative” work. … Because the smirking face of Nielsen contrasts so strikingly with the serious expression on the face of Moore, the ad may reasonably be perceived as commenting on the seriousness, even the pretentiousness, of the original. [*Leibovitz v. Paramount*, 137 F.3d 109 (2d Cir. 1998)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18427314453578523770).

While the commercial nature of a new work tends to weigh against fair use, a transformative work weighs in favor of fair use, and often with more force.  Now let's look at another case involving movie posters: the monster movie art of Basil Gogos. 

<hr class="tall">

<img src="/images/copyright/basil-gogos-fair-use.jpg" class="medium-image">

## Fair Use in Famous Monsters

Spurlock copied plaintiff's "Famous Monsters" magazine covers without modification. They are even closer copies than the Naked Gun poster above. They're still fair use, but this time for a different reason. The copies of Gogos' art are not parodies or appropriation - they are copies for criticism and biography. 

Basil Gogos created significant and highly detailed art. The purpose of his art was to promote movies and sell magazines. The copies were made for "an entirely different purpose" - a biography of Gogos the artist.  Defendant's copies pay homage to Gogos' artistic accomplishments. "The book also provides commentary from many respected individuals in the movie monster industry who attest to the quality of the work and his lasting legacy."  The copies were fair use. [*Warren Publishing v. Spurlock*, 645 F.Supp.2d 402 (EDPA 2009)](scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17369019703437902075).

<img src="/images/copyright/rogers-koons-banality-string-of-puppies-copyright-infringement.jpg" class="medium-image">

## Infringement: Blue Puppies

The Jeff Koons sculpture (right) infringed the original Art Rogers photo (left). It was not fair use. The Koons work had a commercial purpose (he sold it for $376,000), it copied from an artistic (rather than factual) source, and Koons copied nearly every detail of the original. Koons’ argued that his sculpture was satire that criticized societies’ fascination with mass-produced commodities, and should therefore be considered fair use. The Judge disagreed, deciding that copying an artists’ work to criticize society at large was not fair use — to be fair use the copy must criticize the original work. [*Rogers v. Koons* 960 F.2d 301 (2d Cir. 1992)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9102865469766650757). 

Note that this rule was overturned in [*Cariou v. Prince* 714 F.3d 694 (2d Cir. 2013)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5845890683658306826), “The law imposes **no requirement** that a work comment on the original or its author in order to be considered transformative…”.

<hr class="tall">

<img src="/images/copyright/dyer-v-napier-mountain-lion-sculpture-not-infringing.jpg/" class="medium-image">

## No Infringement: Mountain Lion Statue 

A mountain lion statue was not infringing a very similar photograph. This is not a case about fair use. The sculpture was not transformative. Both the original photo and the sculpture shared the same artistic intent - to display the protective nature of a mother mountain lion.  However, the sculpture only copied the non-protectable elements of a mother mountain lion carrying her cub. According to the court, these were elements found in nature rather than elements resulting from the original photographer's creative expression: 

> In this case, however, all of the similarities in expression between the two works at issue consist of unprotectable elements or themes that flow predictably from the underlying subject matter. [*Dyer v. Napier* (D. Ariz, 2006)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12198377657843747362). 


<hr class="tall">

<img src="/images/copyright/blanch-v-koons-fair-use.jpg/" class="medium-image">

## Fair Use: Collage of Advertisements

Photographer Andrea Blanch took the original photo (left) and published it in Allure Magazine. Jeff Koons used the photo in his “Niagara” painting (right). A New York court decided the Koons painting was transformative because:

 > The use of a fashion photograph created for publication in a glossy American “lifestyles” magazine — with changes of its colors, the background against which it is portrayed, the medium, the size of the objects pictured, the objects details and, crucially, their entirely different purpose and meaning — as part of a massive painting commissioned for exhibition in an art-gallery space. [*Blanch v. Koons* (2d Cir. 2006)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3752630071472494999).



<hr class="tall">

## Cariou v. Prince Lightning Round

This case involved 30 works of Richard Prince’s art, each using different amounts of Cariou’s original photography. The appeals court decided 25 were clearly fair use, and 5 were too close to call. [*Cariou v. Prince*, 714 F.3d 694 (2d Cir. 2013)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5845890683658306826). Let's look at some examples:

### Fair Use:

<img src="/images/copyright/cariou-v-prince-round-midnight-fair-use.jpg/" class="medium-image">

### Close Call:

### Close Call:

<img src="/images/copyright/cariou-v-prince-charlie-company-close-call-on-fair-use.jpg/" class="medium-image">

The appeals court sent the five “close call” works back to the trial court for further analysis, but *Cariou v. Prince* settled out of court before the fair use issue was decided.

<img src="/images/copyright/ringgold-v-BET-quilt-copyright-infringement.jpg/" class="medium-image">

## Infringement: Quilt Briefly Decorates TV Set

Showing a quilt in the background of a sitcom for 27 seconds is copyright infringement. The quilt was a highly creative work, and its appearance in the sitcom, though brief, was not transformative. The purpose of the original quilt was to decorate and depict African-American church culture. The purpose of the duplication was to decorate an African-American church set in a TV show. [*Ringgold v. BET* 126 F.3d 70 (2d Cir. 1997)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14762869241442440525).

<hr class="tall">

<img src="/images/copyright/puffinstuff-v-mccheese-copyright-infringement.jpg/" class="medium-image">

## Infringement: Mayor McCheese

Mayor McCheese infringed H.R. PufinStuf. The court noted that "the 'Living Island' locale of Pufnstuf and 'McDonaldland' are both imaginary worlds inhabited by anthromorphic plants and animals and other fanciful creatures... The characters are also similar. Both lands are governed by mayors who have disproportionately large round heads dominated by long wide mouths." [*Krofft v. McDonalds*, 562 F.2d 1157 (9th Cir. 1977)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16740683432222862864).

McDonalds tried to avoid copyright infringement by highlighting some trifling details differentiating McCheese from PufinStuf. It didn’t work:

> We do not believe that the ordinary reasonable person… will even notice that Pufnstuf is wearing a cummerbund while Mayor McCheese is wearing a diplomat’s sash. [*Krofft v. McDonalds*](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16740683432222862864).

I'm not sure why the case looks at the cummerbund while ignoring the fact that MAYOR MCCHEESE'S HEAD IS A GIANT HAMBURGER.
