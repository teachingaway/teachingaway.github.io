In the medical profession they have the concept iatrogenesis, or the iatrogenic artifact. This is harm caused by the naive intervention of doctors, where the best course of treatment (given limitations of medical knowledge) is none at all. It is hard to refrain from treatment under conditions of uncertainty -- first, because doctors have egos and want to think they can diagnose and treat most problems; and second, because there’s a monetary incentive to recommend difficult procedures. Western civilization has been aware of this for some time, which is why the ancient Hippocratic oath requires that a doctor “first do no harm”. It wasn’t until about the 1920s, however, that the medical profession as a whole did more good than harm. In the legal profession, we are frequently accused of “overlawyering”, which in a lot of ways resembles iatrogenesis.

Overlawyering occurs when your advisor recommends a more difficult, expensive, or time-consuming approach than necessary to solve your legal problem. This behavior takes many guises, the classic example being a lawyer who recommends a lawsuit that ends up costing more in time and money than it returns, thus benefitting only the lawyer. For corporate lawyers, the analogy applies where we recommend an approach that involves “sophisticated” legal work, at the expense of your time, budget, your business relationships, and possibly the deal itself.

### When the best course of treatment is none at all, iatrogenesis is the harm caused by active intervention.

Professional advisors who cause iatrogenic conditions are not always, or even mostly, acting in bad faith for their own parochial interest. No, I would guess they usually mean well. They are simply unwilling to admit the limits of their knowledge, and too self-satisfied to acknowledge the incentives at play. This is what Nassim Taleb calls “naive intervention”.

The most effective way to reduce such effects is to experiment with subtracting “necessary” elements of an interventionist regime. If you can remove part of it (a medication, a document, a contract provision) without any ill effects, then you probably should. I say this simplistically, and it works that way. If you can’t identify a need for intervention, then you should not intervene b/c the unintended consequences of that intervention are unknowable. It is all downside.

Subtraction is powerful because it allows natural human abilities to be expressed. Let’s say your lawyer tells you that you need a 500-page doorstop to paper a certain deal. You should think about whether that is really the case. If you remove that controversial and rather obscure clause in your contract, will your interests be harmed or will the only measurable effect be a reduction in closing costs? Maybe you will figure out how to address the concerns by talking to your counterparty rather than relying on your lawyer to anticipate every possible eventuality in the document.

The more I go down this path, the more I want to take this to its logical conclusion in my own practice. I wonder how far we could simplify deal processes as corporate lawyers before we’d miss the parts left on the cutting room floor. Traditional lawyers will object that the bad effects won’t be felt for years, and only the lawyers are sufficiently experienced to evaluate the risk and reward. But in reality, most lawyers build in unnecessary hardware for all the usual reasons of naive intervention -- they do not perceive any personal upside in your long-term success, and are motivated by extreme risk-aversion as well as a desire to prove themselves to be experts in the moment.

The minimalist approach has much to recommend it. Minimal legal effort corresponds with lower costs, faster closing time, and stronger business relationships. These benefits are all felt immediately, up front. The arguable risks are (a) difficult to assess in any event, and (b) not felt usually for a long time, if ever.

Of course, we can’t do most big deals on a handshake these days, certainly not in the US, right? There are key elements to some deals that need to be on paper. Specific numbers and dates that the parties will forget otherwise. Covenants that can only be made in a signed writing, due to statute of frauds. Government filings that are required by law. But outside of that, there is a lot of opportunity to be a radical minimalist. It will make your lawyers nervous, but if they are good they can either explain why a particular item is necessary, or else will admit that it is not.
