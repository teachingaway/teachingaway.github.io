# Acquisition

[Don't Talk to Corp Dev](http://paulgraham.com/corpdev.html). [*Paul Graham*](https://twitter.com/paulg), 2015. "Corporate Development is the group within companies that buys other companies. If you're talking to someone from corp dev, that's why, whether you realize it yet or not. It's usually a mistake to talk to corp dev unless (a) you want to sell your company right now and (b) you're sufficiently likely to get an offer at an acceptable price."

[M&A Case Studies: WhatCounts Sale Process](http://avc.com/2011/01/ma-case-studies-whatcounts-sale-process/). Fred Wilson and [David Geller]() 2011. Do your diligence on the buyer. Only deal with a buyer who shares your values. Get the deal worked out in the LOI stage. "For a relatively small company to be acquired it’s safe to estimate something between $50-$100K in legal fees."

[A Classic Startup Horror Story: the M&A Bait and Switch](http://venturebeat.com/2012/02/27/a-classic-startup-horror-story-the-ma-bait-and-switch/view-all/). Venture Beat, 2012. Paul Graham [comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3639285), "This sort of scenario is unfortunately very common. The antidote is never to allow acquisition talks to be the main thing you're focusing on. We advise startups who get approached by acquirers to treat it as a background process, and not to take things seriously until the very last stage. If acquisition discussions are just a side show, you can easily terminate them if anything goes wrong. Which, interestingly, probably decreases the chances of things going wrong. M&A guys can smell it when you really want a deal, and that makes them want it less."
