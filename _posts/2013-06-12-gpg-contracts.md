Decentralized, cryptographically secured networks have only recently emerged from the obscurity of the deep web and Neal Stephenson novels. Everyone is excited about payment applications b/c of bitcoin’s early financial success, and the potential for similar technologies in the payments industry. But decentralized crypto networks have many implications in the way people transact on a fundamental, human level.

For contracts governing P2P transactions, there is no trusted arbiter. There is no middleman to rescind a fraudulent charge. Cryptographically secured contracts are not readily susceptible to enforcement at the end of a gun.

Reputation thus occupies its rightful place as the most valuable currency in the crypto-business world. Transactions take place on a more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntaryism" target="_blank">voluntary </a> basis. Parties honor commitments out of reputational interest, not out of fear that a court will force compliance or award damages. And parties have reason to think twice before using momentary positional advantage to negotiate one-sided terms. In a way, this represents a return to fundamentals of relationship-based deals.

Public key cryptography provides the tools for parties to trade on reputation even when they do not “know” each other. The resulting transaction is called by some a GPG contract though it is more accurately a P2P transaction where reputation is tracked using GnuPG cryptographic tools. As described by Mircea Popescu, a Romanian crypto-financier, a GPG contract solemnizes a voluntary (gentleman’s) agreement where transacting parties rely on pseudonymous reputation, rather than a legally enforceable contract, to establish trust. Check out Mircea’s entertainingly circuitous <a href="http://polimedia.us/trilema/2012/gpg-contracts/" target="_blank">exposition</a>. For an example of partial GPG contracting implemented in the real world, check out the <a href="http://bitcoin-otc.com/trust.php" target="_blank">web-of-trust system</a> for bitcoin OTC trades.

The basic GPG contract model involves two transacting parties, each with a public pseudonym (which may or may not be linked to an identifiable person). The parties memorialize their deal in writing and each signs with her private key number. The parties then perform the substance of the contract, and have an opportunity to leave a public review of each other’s performance. The reviews are permanently associated with the public pseudonyms used in the transaction, and the world then knows that the people behind those two pseudonyms did a deal and rated each other in some fashion.
Before I continue, I should give a brief intro to GPG public/private key pair encryption for the uninitiated (feel free to skip this paragraph if this is old news). <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/" target="_blank">GPG </a>(GnuPG) is an implementation of cryptographic PGP (pretty good privacy), which works by assigning a pair of keys to each identity, one public and one private. (GPG contracts are called that apparently because current projects make use of GPG tools rather than some other implementation). To use the standard naming convention, we’ll refer to a crypto-anarchist named Bob. Bob has a public key and a private key. He announces the public key to the world, but retains the private key in secret. Anyone can send an encrypted message to Bob by running the message through a trapdoor function that uses Bob’s public key to turn the message text into random-looking noise. Bob is able to decrypt the message with his private key. But no one else can decrypt the message (unless they steal Bob’s private key, or build a quantum computer). Bob can also prove that he is the author of any message by signing it with his private key; anyone who knows Bob’s public key can verify for himself that a message was signed using Bob’s private key, but cannot use Bob’s signature to reverse-engineer the private key. If Bob has a friend Alice who is also a paranoid crypto nerd, the two can communicate reliably using PGP -- “reliably” meaning they can confirm that a message originates with the other sender, and can obscure the content of their messages from the prying eyes of third-party observers.

GPG contracts solve a problem common to transactions between strangers on the Internet. If parties to a transaction do not know each other, then neither has any skin in the game. There is nothing to prevent one or both parties from cheating, thus theoretically no anonymous transactions will occur without a middleman (trusted online store owner, escrow agent, government enforcer). The heart of this solution is a review system, similar to the eBay stars ratings. Review systems (stars) bridge the gap by creating a way to establish trust pseudonymously. Parties create profiles --pseudonyms -- that serve as commercial identity. If you buy something from eBay, you can leave a review. Most sellers work hard to maintain high reviews, because a 5-star rating is a valuable commercial asset. Theoretically you could sue an eBay seller if she rips you off badly enough, but most of the time it would not be worth it because the cost and heartache of litigation far exceeds the amount in controversy. Of course, with eBay there is still a central authority to deal with complaints, fraud, etc., without having to go to court.

GPG contracts are similar to the eBay stars system, in that parties to a transaction have an opportunity to affix reviews that are indelibly associated with each other’s pseudonym. Before entering into a deal with an anonymous stranger, you can verify that the stranger holds the private key associated with a particular pseudonym. And you can read all the reviews associated with that pseudonym (both those reviews left by others who dealt with him, and those authored by him). With web-of-trust, you can also find someone in your trust network who can vouch, directly or indirectly, for your proposed counterparty. The difference with GPG contracts is that there is no central authority, the subject of the exchange is theoretically unlimited, and the party ratings are permanently, verifiably, and irrevocably associated with the identities used in that exchange. The concept is powerful, and it is also extensible. Software- and human-based tools can be built around the basic protocol to address more complicated use cases.

Some <a href="http://www.yozons.com/digitalSignatures.jsp" target="_blank">criticism </a>of using PGP keys to sign contracts is that doing so requires all parties to use the system correctly, meaning that users must maintain their private keys with perfect security, and are fully responsible for not losing them, lest they lose the ability to sign on behalf of the identity they have created. Also PGP does not natively support the application of multiple party signatures. These criticisms are valid. There is always some trade-off between security and convenience.

Many of the technical limitations can be overcome by allowing parties to designate a third party that they trust to perform certain functions (e.g., to revoke lost keys, sign on behalf of a group, etc.). There are also some human complications to GPG contracting. Pseudonymous reputation-based systems do not protect against fraud, particularly of the long-con variety. The first answer to this is that the user should exercise caution in transacting with unknown people. Maybe you ought to see if someone you know personally can vouch for your counterparty before you wire a million bucks worth of bitcoin to an unknown wallet address, even one associated with rave reviews. It is also possible to extend GPG contracting technology to allow for third parties to act as escrow agents or arbitrators, either to authorize release of escrowed funds / property based on submitted evidence, or to pass judgment on the validity of a review. These third-party agents would also be governed by the same GPG reviews system, and would presumably want some fee for their services.

Legally, it’s an interesting question whether you could make GPG contracts truly voluntary. Most courts would in fact find a GPG contract to be entirely binding, assuming the language is otherwise valid. Obscurity and/or secrecy may keep the dispute out of court, but if you can find a defaulting party then you can theoretically bring her to court to present evidence of a valid contract and breach thereof. If the amount in controversy is high enough, then there’s a real incentive to repent the Libertarian voluntaryist ideology and go after the damages through the usual methods. Even if the parties disclaim any enforceability within the body of the contract, their subsequent pattern of behavior may well be deemed to evidence an agreement that is enforceable in equity. Thus it may be necessary for larger or less obscure transactions to contemplate the interface between GPG contracts and conventional dispute-resolution procedures. I have some thoughts about this, but will leave them for another time...
