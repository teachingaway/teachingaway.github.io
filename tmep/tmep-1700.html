</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e97" class="nobull">(a) Petition may be taken to the Director:  (1)
 From any repeated or final formal requirement of the examiner in the ex parte
 prosecution of an application if permitted by §2.63(b); (2) in any case for which the
 Act of 1946, or Title 35 of the United States Code, or this Part of Title 37 of the
 Code of Federal Regulations specifies that the matter is to be determined directly or
 reviewed by the Director; (3) to invoke the supervisory authority of the Director in
 appropriate circumstances; (4) in any case not specifically defined and provided for
 by this Part of Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations; (5) in an extraordinary
 situation, when justice requires and no other party is injured thereby, to request a
 suspension or waiver of any requirement of the rules not being a requirement of the
 Act of 1946.
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e104" class="nobull">(b) Questions of substance arising during the ex
 parte prosecution of applications, including, but not limited to, questions arising
 under §§2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 23 of the Act of 1946, are not considered to be appropriate
 subject matter for petitions to the Director.
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e110" class="nobull">(c) Every petition to the Director shall
 include a statement of the facts relevant to the petition, the points to be reviewed,
 the action or relief requested, and the fee required by §2.6.  Any brief in support of
 the petition shall be embodied in or accompany the petition.  The petition must be
 signed by the petitioner, someone with legal authority to bind the petitioner (e.g., a
 corporate officer or general partner of a partnership), or a practitioner qualified to
 practice under §11.14 of this chapter, in accordance with the requirements of
 §2.193(e)(5).  When facts are to be proved on petition, the petitioner must submit
 proof in the form of affidavits or declarations in accordance with §2.20, signed by
 someone with firsthand knowledge of the facts to be proved, and any
 exhibits.
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e116" class="nobull">(d) A petition must be filed within two months
 of the date of issuance of the action from which relief is requested, unless a
 different deadline is specified elsewhere in this chapter.
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e122" class="nobull">(e)(1) A petition from the grant or denial of a
 request for an extension of time to file a notice of opposition must be filed within
 fifteen days from the date of issuance of the grant or denial of the request.  A
 petition from the grant of a request must be served on the attorney or other
 authorized representative of the potential opposer, if any, or on the potential
 opposer.  A petition from the denial of a request must be served on the attorney or
 other authorized representative of the applicant, if any, or on the applicant.  Proof
 of service of the petition must be made as provided by §2.119.  The potential opposer
 or the applicant, as the case may be, may file a response within fifteen days from the
 date of service of the petition and must serve a copy of the response on the
 petitioner, with proof of service as provided by §2.119.  No further document relating
 to the petition may be filed.
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e129" class="nobull">(2) A petition from an interlocutory order of
 the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board must be filed within thirty days after the date
 of issuance of the order from which relief is requested.  Any brief in response to the
 petition must be filed, with any supporting exhibits, within fifteen days from the
 date of service of the petition.  Petitions and responses to petitions, and any
 documents accompanying a petition or response under this subsection must be served on
 every adverse party pursuant to §2.119.
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e135" class="nobull">(f) An oral hearing will not be held on a
 petition except when considered necessary by the Director.
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e142" class="nobull">(g) The mere filing of a petition to the
 Director will not act as a stay in any appeal or inter partes proceeding that is
 pending before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board nor stay the period for replying
 to an Office action in an application except when a stay is specifically requested and
 is granted or when §§2.63(b) and 2.65 are applicable to an ex parte
 application.
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e149" class="nobull">(h) Authority to act on petitions, or on any
 petition, may be delegated by the Director.
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e155" class="nobull">(i) Where a petitioner seeks to reactivate an
 application or registration that was abandoned, cancelled or expired because documents
 were lost or mishandled, the Director may deny the petition if the petitioner was not
 diligent in checking the status of the application or registration.  To be considered
 diligent, a petitioner must:
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e161" class="nobull">(1) During the pendency of an application,
 check the status of the application every six months between the filing date of the
 application and issuance of a registration;
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e169" class="nobull">(2) After registration, check the status of the
 registration every six months from the filing of an affidavit of use or excusable
 nonuse under section 8 or 71 of the Act, or a renewal application under section 9 of
 the Act, until the petitioner receives notice that the affidavit or renewal
 application has been accepted; and
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e175" class="nobull">(3) If the status check reveals that the Office
 has not received a document filed by the petitioner, or that the Office has issued an
 action or notice that the petitioner has not received, the petitioner must promptly
 request corrective action.
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e182" class="nobull">(j) If the Director denies a petition, the
 petitioner may request reconsideration, if the petitioner:
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e189" class="nobull">(1) Files the request within two months of the
 date of issuance of the decision denying the petition; and
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d23e196" class="nobull">(2) Pays a second petition fee under
 §2.6.

 partes proceedings before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (“Board”) who believe they have
 been injured by certain adverse actions of the USPTO, or who believe that they cannot comply
 with the requirements of the Trademark Rules of Practice (37 C.F.R. Parts 2, 3, 6, and 7)
 because of an extraordinary situation, may seek equitable relief by filing a petition under 37
 C.F.R. §2.146.

 a petition to review an examining attorney’s formal requirement if permitted by 37 C.F.R.
 §2.63(b).  Under 37 C.F.R. §2.63(b)(1), a petition from a requirement that is repeated but not
 made final is permitted if the subject matter of the requirement is appropriate for petition.
  Under 37 C.F.R. §2.63(b)(2), a petition from a final requirement is permitted only if the
 final action
<i> is limited to</i> subject matter appropriate for petition.  See
 
<b>
<a href="tmep-1700.html#TMEP-1700d1e115">TMEP §1704</a>

 petitionable subject matter.  If a petition under 37 C.F.R. §2.146(a)(1) is denied, the
 applicant has six months from the issuance date of the Office action that repeated the
 requirement or made it final, or thirty days from the date of the decision on the petition,
 whichever is later, to comply with the requirement.  37 C.F.R. §2.63(b).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-7d130e232">Under 37 C.F.R. §2.146(a)(2), a petition may be
 filed in any case for which the Trademark Act, Trademark Rules of Practice, or Title 35 of the
 United States Code specifies that the matter is to be determined directly or reviewed by the
 Director.  This includes petitions to review the actions of the Post Registration staff under
 15 U.S.C. §§1057, 1058, 1059, and 1141k.

 Petitionable Subject Matter
</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e353">
<i>Ex Parte
 Examination
</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-4d130e356">Under 37 C.F.R. §2.63(b), an applicant may petition
 the Director to review an examining attorney’s repeated or final requirement if the subject
 matter of the requirement is appropriate for petition.  However, under 37 C.F.R. §2.146(b),
 “[q]uestions of substance arising during the ex parte prosecution of applications, including,
 but not limited to, questions arising under §§2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 23 of the Act of 1946, are not
 considered to be appropriate subject matter for petitions....”
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-5d130e359">Procedural issues reviewable on petition include:
  whether a disclaimer was properly printed in standardized format; whether an examining
 attorney acted properly in suspending an application; whether an examining attorney acted
 properly in holding an application abandoned for failure to file a complete response to an
 Office action (see 
<b>
<a href="tmep-1700.html#TMEP-1700d1e564">TMEP
 §1713
</a>
</b>); and whether it was premature for an examining attorney to
 issue a final action.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-6d130e366">Substantive issues that arise in ex parte
 examination are not proper subject matter for petition, and may be reviewed only by the
 Trademark Trial and Appeal Board on appeal.  See 
<b>
<a href="tmep-1500.html#TMEP-1500d1e7">TMEP §§1501–1501.07</a>
</b> regarding appeal
 procedure.  For example, an examining attorney’s requirement for a special form drawing that
 agrees with the mark shown on the specimen(s) of record may not be reviewed on petition,
 because it requires an analysis of the commercial impression of the mark.  
<i>In re
 Hart
</i>, 199 USPQ 585, 587 (Comm’r Pats. 1978).  An examining attorney’s requirement
 for a disclaimer of a feature of a mark is also improper subject matter for petition.
  
<i>Ex parte Florida Citrus Canners Coop.</i>, 37 USPQ 463 (Comm’r Pats. 1938);
 
<i>Ex parte Kleen-O-Dent Labs., Inc.</i>, 37 USPQ 232 (Comm’r Pats. 1938).  The
 question of whether an amendment to a drawing is a material alteration of the mark is not
 petitionable, but the question of whether USPTO practice permits an applicant to correct an
 allegedly obvious typographical error on a drawing was found to be reviewable on petition.
  
<i>In re Tetrafluor Inc.</i>, 17 USPQ2d 1160 (Comm’r Pats. 1990).  The
 determination of what is appealable and what is petitionable is made on a case-by-case
 basis.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-7d130e372">Some issues that arise in ex parte examination may
 be reviewed by either petition or appeal.  For example, the question of who is a proper
 signatory of a statement of use or other verification of facts on behalf of an applicant may
 be reviewed by either petition or appeal.  
<i>In re Dermahose Inc.</i>, 82 USPQ2d
 1793, 1795, n.5 (TTAB 2007).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-8d130e375">A requirement for amendment of an identification of
 goods/services may also be reviewed by either petition or appeal. 
<i> In re Stenographic
 Machs., Inc.
</i>, 199 USPQ 313, 316 (Comm’r Pats. 1978).  On the other hand, a
 requirement for amendment of the classification is a procedural matter that may only be
 reviewed on petition. 
<i> In re Tee-Pak, Inc.</i>, 164 USPQ 88, 89 (TTAB
 1969).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-9d130e378">If an applicant files a petition from an examining

<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-12d130e388">Trademark Rule 2.146(b) applies only to questions
 of substance that arise during ex parte examination of applications for registration.  The
 Director considers questions of substance, such as whether a proposed amendment materially
 alters a registered mark or whether a specimen supports use of a registered mark, when
 reviewing the action of the Post Registration staff in connection with a proposed amendment
 filed under 15 U.S.C. §1057 (“§7 amendment”), or an affidavit of use under 15 U.S.C. §1058 or
 §1141k (“§8 affidavit” or “§71 affidavit”).  The decisions of Post Registration staff under 15
 U.S.C. §§1057, 1058, 1059, and 1141k may not be appealed to the Board.

 expiration of a registration for failure to file a renewal application under §9 (15 U.S.C.

 Furthermore, a petition under 37 C.F.R. §2.146 requesting that the Director accept a

 required by 37 C.F.R. §2.6.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-4d130e435">Any petition that is not accompanied by the
 required fee is incomplete.  A staff attorney or paralegal in the Office of the Deputy
 Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy will notify the petitioner in writing that the
 petition is incomplete and grant the petitioner 30 days to submit the fee.  If the fee is
 not submitted within the time allowed, the petition is denied without consideration on the
 merits, because the petitioner has not met the requirements for filing a petition.
  
<i>See</i> 37 C.F.R. §2.146(c).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-5d130e438">A petition fee will be waived only in an
 extraordinary situation (
<i>see</i>

<a href="tmep-1700.html#TMEP-1700d1e356">TMEP §1708</a>

 record clearly shows that the petition was the result of a USPTO error.  When requesting
 waiver of a fee, it is recommended that the petitioner submit the fee, but include a request
 that the fee be refunded because the petition was the result of a USPTO error.  This will
 expedite consideration of the petition if the request for waiver of the petition fee is
 denied.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-6d130e445">If a check submitted as a petition fee is
 returned to the USPTO unpaid, or an electronic funds transfer or credit card is refused or

 along with a fee for processing the payment that was refused or charged back, before the
 petition will be considered on the merits.  37 C.F.R. §2.6(b)(12).

 relevant facts, and should be accompanied by any evidence to be considered.  Under 37 C.F.R.
 §2.146(c), when facts are to be proved, the petitioner must submit proof in the form of an
 affidavit or declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-4d130e464">An affidavit or declaration supporting a petition
 should be based on firsthand knowledge.  For example, if the petition arises from the loss
 or misplacement of a document submitted to the USPTO, it should be accompanied by the
 affidavit or declaration of the person who sent the document, attesting to the date of
 submission and identifying the document filed with the petition as a true copy of the
 document previously filed.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-5d130e467">When a petition includes an unverified assertion
 that is not supported by evidence, a staff attorney or paralegal in the Office of the Deputy
 Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy will notify the petitioner that an affidavit
 or declaration is required, and grant the petitioner 30 days to submit the necessary
 verification.  If the petitioner does not submit a verification within the time allowed, the
 petition will be denied, or, in appropriate cases, a decision on petition will be rendered
 based on the information in the record, without consideration of the unverified
 assertion.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-6d130e471">This procedure is also followed with respect to
 physical evidence.  If physical evidence is available, such as a postcard receipt that shows
 the date of actual receipt of a document in the USPTO (

 the filing fee for a missing document, the petitioner should include the evidence with the
 initial petition.  However, if the evidence is omitted from the initial filing, the USPTO
 will give the petitioner an opportunity to supplement the petition within a specified time
 limit, normally 30 days.

   Due Diligence

<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e614">Applicants and registrants are responsible for
 tracking the status of matters pending before the USPTO.  When a petitioner seeks to
 reactivate an application or registration that was abandoned, cancelled, or expired due to
 the loss or mishandling of documents sent to or from the USPTO, the USPTO may deny the
 petition if the petitioner was not diligent in checking the status of the application or
 registration, even if the petitioner can show that the USPTO actually received documents, or
 declares that a notice from the USPTO was never received by the petitioner.  37 C.F.R.
 §2.146(i).  
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-4d130e617">The required showing of diligence is necessary to
 protect third parties who may be harmed by the removal and later reinsertion of an
 application or registration into the USPTO’s database.  For example, a third party may have
 searched USPTO records and begun using a mark because the search showed no earlier-filed
 conflicting marks, or an examining attorney may have searched USPTO records and approved a
 later-filed application for a conflicting mark because the examining attorney was unaware of
 the earlier-filed application.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-5d130e620">The USPTO generally processes applications,
 responses, and other documents in the order in which they are received.  Since it is
 reasonable to expect some notice from the USPTO about a pending matter within six months of
 the filing or receipt of a document, a party who has not received the expected written
 action or telephone call from the USPTO within that time frame should be on notice that the
 filing may have been lost.  The party awaiting notification has the burden of inquiring as
 to the cause of the delay, and requesting corrective action in writing when
 necessary.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-6d130e624">To be considered diligent, a petitioner

<ul style="list-style-type: none">

<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-9d130e651">Applicants and registrants should check the
 status on each six‑month anniversary of the filing of an application for registration, §8 or
 §71 affidavit, or §9 renewal application to avoid abandonment or cancellation and to ensure
 that they meet the diligence requirement.  For example, if an application was filed on
 October 1, 2009, the applicant should check the status on May 1, 2010, November 1, 2010, and
 on each six-month anniversary thereafter, until a registration is issued.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-10d130e654">However, to provide applicants, registrants, and
 their attorneys with flexibility in docketing deadlines for both responses and status
 checks, an applicant or registrant will meet the diligence requirement if the applicant or
 registrant checks the status within six months of the filing or receipt of a document for
 which further action by the USPTO is expected.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-11d130e657">Applicants and registrants can check the status
 of an application or registration through the Trademark Status and Document Retrieval
 (“TSDR”) database on the USPTO website at 
<b>
<a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/" target="_blank">http://tsdr.uspto.gov/</a>
</b>, which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a
 week.  The party should print the TSDR screen and place it in the party’s own file, in order
 to have a record of the status inquiry and the information learned.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-12d130e664">A party who does not have access to the Internet
 can call the Trademark Assistance Center at (571) 272-9250 or (800) 786-9199 to determine
 the status.  After making a telephone status inquiry, a party should make a note in the
 party’s own file as to the date of the status inquiry and the information learned.  No
 further documentation is required to establish that the status inquiry was made.  Written
 status inquiries are discouraged, because they may delay processing of the application or
 registration.  
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-13d130e667">If a status inquiry reveals that a document sent
 to the USPTO was not received, that an Office action or notice was issued but not received
 by the applicant or registrant, that an application has been abandoned or a registration
 cancelled or expired, or that some other problem exists, corrective action should be
 promptly requested in writing.  37 C.F.R. §2.146(i)(3).  Petitions should be directed to the
 Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy.  Requests for
 reinstatement should be directed to the paralegals in the Office of the Deputy Commissioner
 for Trademark Examination Policy, the supervisory legal instruments examiner in the law
 office, or the supervisor of the ITU/Divisional Unit or Post Registration Section.  See

 caused a registration to expire or be cancelled due to failure to file a §8 affidavit, §71

 accept an affidavit of use or excusable nonuse or a renewal application, the registrant may
 file a request for reinstatement.  See

 support a request for reinstatement.  Generally, where there is proof that a registration
 was cancelled solely due to a USPTO error, a request for reinstatement will not be denied
 solely because the registrant was not diligent in monitoring the status of the §8 affidavit
 or renewal application.  However, if a registrant receives a written notice of cancellation,
 or has actual notice that a registration was cancelled, the USPTO will deny the request for
 reinstatement as untimely if it was not filed:  (1) within two months of the issuance date
 of the cancellation notice; or (2) within two months of actual notice of cancellation, if

 Petition to Make Special
</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e924">The USPTO generally examines applications in the
 order in which they are received.  A petition to make “special” is a request to advance the
 initial examination of an application out of its regular order.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-4d130e927">A petition to make “special” must be accompanied
 by:  (1) the fee required by 37 C.F.R. §2.6; (2) an explanation of why special action is
 requested; and (3) a statement of facts that shows that special action is justified.  The
 statement of facts should be supported by an affidavit or declaration under 37 C.F.R.
 §2.20.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-5d130e930">The petition is reviewed in the Office of the
 Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy.  The applicant should first file the
 application via the Trademark Electronic Application System (“TEAS”) at 
<b>
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/teas/e-TEAS/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.uspto.gov</a>
</b>.  The
 applicant should then submit a petition to make special that includes the newly assigned
 serial number.  To ensure proper routing and processing, the Office prefers that the petition
 also be filed electronically.  In TEAS, the Petition to Make Special form can be accessed by
 clicking on the link entitled “Petition Forms.”
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-6d130e937">Alternatively, the petition should be faxed to the
 attention of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy at the following fax
 number:  571-273-0032.  If the petition is submitted by mail, it should be submitted
 
<i>separately</i> from the application, marked to the attention of the Deputy
 Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy.

</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e954">Invoking supervisory authority under 37 C.F.R.
 §2.146 to make an application “special” is an extraordinary remedy that is granted only when
 very special circumstances exist, such as a 
<i>demonstrable</i> possibility of
 the loss of substantial rights.  A petition to make “special” is denied when the
 circumstances would apply equally to a large number of other applicants.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-4d130e957">The fact that the applicant is about to embark on
 an advertising campaign is 
<i>not</i> considered a circumstance that justifies
 advancement of an application out of the normal order of examination, because this situation
 applies to a substantial number of applicants.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-5d130e960">The most common reasons for granting petitions to
 make “special” are the existence of actual or threatened infringement, pending litigation,
 or the need for a registration as a basis for securing a foreign
 registration.

 Review of Denial of Filing Dates
</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e985">If an application is denied a filing date and the
 applicant wants the filing date restored, the usual procedure is to file a petition under 37
 C.F.R. §2.146.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-4d130e988">However, in the limited circumstances listed below,
 the applicant may request restoration of the filing date without a formal
 petition:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li class="nobull">(1) The USPTO has no record of receipt of the
 application, but the applicant presents proof that a complete application was filed
 through the Trademark Electronic Application System (“TEAS”), in the form of a copy of a
 TEAS “Success” page confirming receipt of the application (
<i>see</i>
<b>
<a href="tmep-0300.html#TMEP-300d1e267">TMEP
 §303.02(a)
</a>
</b>) or a copy of an e-mail confirmation issued by the
 USPTO that includes the date of receipt and a summary of the TEAS
 submission.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(2) The USPTO has no record of receipt of the
 application, but the applicant presents proof of actual receipt in the form of evidence
 that a USPTO employee signed for or acknowledged the envelope containing the application
 (e.g., a certified mail receipt that bears a USPTO date stamp or label, or the signature
 of a USPTO employee), accompanied by an affidavit or declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20
 attesting to the contents of the envelope.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(3) A filing date was denied, but the application
 itself clearly shows on its face that the applicant met all relevant filing date
 requirements on the filing date being requested.  If the application was filed on paper,
 the applicant must resubmit any returned documents showing the cancelled filing
 date.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(4) A filing date was denied to a paper
 application due to the omission of an element, such as a drawing, but the element was in
 fact included in the application as originally submitted, 
<i>and</i> the
 applicant submits 
<i>all</i> of the following:  (a) a return postcard
 indicating that the USPTO specifically acknowledged receipt of the element in question
 (
<i>see</i>
<b>
<a href="tmep-0300.html#TMEP-300d1e279">TMEP
 §303.02(c)
</a>
</b>); (b) a substitute to replace the lost element;
 (c) the application documents that were returned; 
<i>and</i>(d) a copy of the
 Notice of Incomplete Trademark Application.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(5) Applicant provides evidence that applicant
 attempted to file the application through TEAS, but TEAS was unavailable due to technical
 problems (e.g., a computer screen printout showing receipt of a “Fatal Error - Access
 Denied” error message, or a copy of an e-mail message from the TEAS Help Desk stating that
 the TEAS application forms were temporarily unavailable).  
<i>See</i>
<i>In re Henkel Loctite Corp.,</i>69 USPQ2d 1638 (Dir USPTO
 2003).
</li>
</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-6d130e1044">In the above situations, a staff attorney or
 paralegal in the Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy may
 restore the original filing date without a formal petition or a petition fee.  In all other
 circumstances, the applicant must file a formal petition, including the petition fee required
 by 37 C.F.R. §2.6.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-7d130e1048">
<i>Procedure for Filing Request.</i>
  In any request to restore an application filing date, the applicant should first refile the
 application, with the application filing fee required by 37 C.F.R. §2.6(a)(1)(i), (ii), or
 (iii), as appropriate.  The USPTO prefers that the application be filed electronically via
 TEAS at 
<b>
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/teas/e-TEAS/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.uspto.gov</a>
</b>.  
<i>The application filing fee must be included
 even if the applicant has not yet received a refund of the fee previously paid
</i>.
  
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-8d130e1054">After the applicant receives a new serial number,
 the applicant should submit a request to restore the original filing date.  To ensure proper
 routing and processing, the Office prefers that the request also be filed electronically.  In
 TEAS, the Request to Restore Filing Date form can be accessed by clicking on the link entitled
 “Petition Forms” at 
<b>
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/teas/e-TEAS/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.uspto.gov</a>
</b>.  Alternatively, the request should be faxed to the
 Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy at 571-273-8950.  The
 request should:  (1) include the new serial number; (2) state the reason(s) why the applicant
 believes the filing date was denied in error; and (3) include a copy of any Notice of
 Incomplete Trademark Application received from the USPTO.  
<i>See</i>
<b>
<a href="tmep-0200.html#TMEP-200d1e263">TMEP
 §204.02
</a>
</b>. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-9d130e1063">
<i>Time for Filing Request.</i>  All
 requests to restore filing dates, whether made by formal petition or informal request, must be
 filed promptly.  If the USPTO issues a notice advising the applicant of the denial or
 cancellation of the filing date, the request to restore the filing date must be filed within
 two months of the issuance date of the action, or it will be denied as untimely.  37 C.F.R.
 §2.146(d).  Although applicants have two months from the issuance date of this notice to file
 a request to restore the original filing date, it is recommended that an applicant promptly
 refile the application, and file the request to restore the filing date immediately upon
 receipt of the new serial number, to minimize the delay in receiving a filing date, and to
 reduce the impact on third parties who may rely on the current filing date information in the
 Trademark database.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-10d130e1066">Furthermore, applicants must exercise due
 diligence in monitoring the status of applications.  37 C.F.R. §2.146(i);
 
<b>
<a href="tmep-1700.html#TMEP-1700d1e234">TMEP §1705.05</a>
</b>.  To be
 considered diligent, an applicant must check the status of a pending application every six
 months between the filing date of the application and issuance of a registration.  37 C.F.R.
 §2.146(i)(1).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-11d130e1072">
<i>Evidence of Missing Element
 Required
</i>.  If the USPTO denies a filing date due to the omission of an element
 required by 37 C.F.R. §2.21, and the applicant declares that the missing element was in fact
 included with the application as filed, the Director will not grant a petition to restore or
 reinstate the filing date unless:  (1) the applicant provides evidence that the element was
 received in the USPTO on the requested filing date; or (2) there is an image of the element in
 the USPTO’s Trademark Image Capture and Retrieval System (“TICRS”) database.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-12d130e1075">The USPTO scans images of applications almost
 immediately after they are received in the USPTO and uploads these scanned images into TICRS.
  Because very little time passes between receipt of the application and creation of the
 scanned image, it is highly likely that the TICRS file of an application will be an exact copy
 of what was received in the USPTO.  Accordingly, if TICRS does not include an image of a
 missing element that a petitioner declares was submitted with the application, the Director
 will not grant the petition unless there is evidence to corroborate the petitioner’s
 declaration.  An example of corroborating evidence is a postcard submitted with the original
 application that bears:  (1) a USPTO date stamp; and (2) an itemized list of materials
 submitted that includes the missing element.

 signed by an unauthorized party, the Director will find that (1) the application should have
 been abandoned for failure to respond, (2) the petition will be construed as a petition to

 Letters of Protest in Pending Applications
</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e2211">A letter of protest is an informal procedure
 created by and existing at the discretion of the USPTO, whereby third parties may bring to the
 attention of the USPTO evidence bearing on the registrability of a mark.  The letter of
 protest procedure applies only to pending applications and is intended to aid in examination
 without causing undue delay and without compromising the integrity and objectivity of the ex
 parte examination process.  
<i>See</i>
<i>In re BPJ Enter's., Ltd.</i>, 7 USPQ2d 1375 (Comm'r Pats. 1988); 
<i>In re
 Pohn
</i>, 3 USPQ2d 1700 (Comm'r Pats. 1987).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-4d130e2214">Letters of protest are reviewed in the Office of
 the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy (“Deputy Commissioner”) to determine
 whether the submitted information should be given to the examining attorney for consideration.
  To preserve the integrity and objectivity of the ex parte examination process, the letter of
 protest never becomes part of the application file and the Deputy Commissioner acts on the
 letter of protest without consulting with the examining attorney.  The Deputy Commissioner
 considers only the record in the application and the evidence submitted by the protestor.
  
<i>BPJ Enter's.</i>, 7 USPQ2d at 1378.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-5d130e2217">If a third party attempts to contact an examining
 attorney regarding a letter of protest, the examining attorney will refer the third party to
 the Deputy Commissioner’s Office.  If an examining attorney receives a letter of protest, the
 letter will be referred to the Deputy Commissioner’s Office for consideration.  If the letter
 of protest is mistakenly entered in the record as a document received from the applicant, all
 evidence of that receipt will be expunged from the application record.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-6d130e2221">The Deputy Commissioner will accept a letter of
 protest filed before publication where it is determined that the evidence is relevant and
 supports any reasonable ground for refusal appropriate in ex parte examination.  The Deputy
 Commissioner will accept a letter of protest filed after publication only if the protestor
 submits prima facie evidence supporting a refusal of registration, such that publication of
 the mark without consideration of the issue and evidence presented in the letter of protest
 was a clear error (

   Appropriate and Inappropriate Subjects to Be Raised in Letter of
 Protest
</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e2241">It is inappropriate to use the letter of protest
 procedure to delay registration or to present purely adversarial arguments.  The USPTO
 denies letters of protest that merely present adversarial arguments that registration should
 be refused.  Adversarial arguments in letters of protest are not sent to the examining
 attorney.  These objections to registration should be made in an opposition proceeding after
 publication or, in the case of the Supplemental Register, a cancellation proceeding after
 registration.  The letter of protest procedure may not be used to circumvent the
 requirements for filing an opposition.  The USPTO also denies letters of protest that do not
 include factual, objective evidence.

<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1700d1e873">1715.01(a)   Issues Appropriate as Subjects of Letters of Protest</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e2252">Appropriate subjects for letters of protest
 concern issues that the examining attorney has the authority and resources to pursue to a
 legal conclusion without further intervention by third parties.  The following are
 examples of the most common areas of protest:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li class="nobull">(1) A third party files an objection to the
 registration of a term because it is allegedly generic or descriptive.  The objection
 must be accompanied by 
<i>evidence</i> of genericness or descriptiveness.
  The evidence should be objective, independent, and factual evidence that the
 examining attorney may use to support the suggested refusal.  Personal opinions are
 subjective and may be self-serving, and are not forwarded to the examining attorney.
  If the letter of protest is accepted, the examining attorney is informed that an
 objection to registration has been filed on the ground that the mark is generic or
 descriptive, and is given a copy of any factual evidence submitted with the letter of
 protest.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(2) A third party notifies the USPTO of the
 existence of a federally registered mark or prior-pending application and alleges that
 there is a likelihood of confusion between this mark and the mark in the application
 that is the subject of the letter of protest.  If the letter of protest is accepted,
 the examining attorney is notified that an objection to the registration of the mark
 has been made on the ground of an alleged likelihood of confusion with a registered
 mark or prior pending application, and is referred to the registration or application
 information as it appears in the automated records of the USPTO.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(3) A third party files a request that
 prosecution of an application be suspended because of pending litigation claiming
 infringement based on the applicant’s use of the applied-for mark.  The litigation
 must be specifically identified and a copy of the relevant pleadings must be enclosed.
  The litigation must involve a federally registered mark or prior pending application
 of the protestor, and the protestor must allege that there is a likelihood of
 confusion between this mark and the mark in the application that is the subject of the
 letter of protest.  Normally, a court proceeding is not considered relevant to the
 registrability of a mark unless the remedy requested in the proceeding is
 cancellation, abandonment, or amendment of the application that is the subject of the
 letter of protest.  If the letter of protest is accepted, the examining attorney is
 informed that a request for suspension has been received based on an alleged
 likelihood of confusion with a registered mark or prior pending application that is
 the subject of pending litigation.  Copies of the relevant pleadings are placed in the
 record.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(4) A third party notifies the USPTO that
 registered marks are being used inappropriately in identifications of goods and
 services for particular applications.  (
<i>See</i>
<b>
<a href="tmep-1400.html#TMEP-1400d1e2565">TMEP
 §1402.09
</a>
</b>.) 
</li>
<li class="nobull">(5) A third party notifies the USPTO of the
 existence of a subsequently filed U.S. application and alleges that the application
 contains a proper claim of priority under §44(d) to which the third party is entitled
 and that there is a likelihood of confusion between its mark and the mark in a
 prior-filed application that is the subject of the letter of protest.

<a href="tmep-1900.html#TMEP-1900d1e1027">1904.01(e)</a>
</b>.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(6) A third party notifies the USPTO of the existence of an application filed
 under §66(a) with an earlier filing date or a priority claim to which the third party
 is entitled and that there is a likelihood of confusion between its mark and the mark
 in the application that is the subject of the letter of protest, and the §66(a)
 application may not have been entered into the USPTO database at the time the
 application that is the subject of the letter of protest was examined.

 foreign application relied upon as the basis for a claim of priority under §44(d) is
 not the first application filed in a treaty country and provides evidence of the
 existence of an earlier-filed foreign registration or pending foreign application.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e2302">The following are examples of issues that are
 
<i>not</i> appropriate to raise in letters of protest:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li class="nobull">(1) A third party claims earlier common-law
 use of a trademark but does not have a federal registration or previously filed
 pending application for that mark.  The examining attorney can only consider
 registrations and prior-pending applications when determining likelihood of confusion.
  Earlier common-law use, state registrations, and other claims based on evidence other
 than federal registrations and prior-pending applications for federal registration are
 not appropriate for presentation to examining attorneys during ex parte
 examination.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(2) A third party claims that the applicant is
 not the proper owner of the mark.  This issue requires proof that is beyond the scope
 of authority of an examining attorney to require during ex parte examination.
  
<i>In re Apple Computer, Inc.</i>, 57 USPQ2d 1823 (Comm'r Pats.
 1998).
</li>
<li class="nobull">(3) Numerous third parties set forth the
 opinion that the mark should not register, but do not offer any evidence or legal
 reason to support the refusal.  The letter of protest procedure should not be used as
 a means for expressing public opinion about a particular mark.  The trademark
 registration process is governed by statutory laws and federal regulations.  Public
 opinion may not be used to influence the application process; therefore, mass mailings
 by special-interest groups will not be made part of the record.  Letters of protest
 that raise the same objection to registration submitted by five or more different
 parties will be considered a mass mailing.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(4) A third party requests that prosecution of
 an application be suspended or refused because of pending litigation, but does not
 provide proof that the pending litigation includes grounds upon which the Office can
 suspend or refuse registration (e.g., the litigation does not involve a federally
 registered mark or prior-pending application of the protestor).
</li>
<li class="nobull">(5) A third party claims that the applicant
 has committed fraud against the USPTO.

</b>.  Therefore, upon request, the Board will generally
 restore jurisdiction and remand the application to the examining attorney.  See TBMP §215
 for further information concerning the effect of a letter of protest when an opposition or
 request for extension of time to oppose has been filed. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-4d130e2475">If the letter of protest concerns a mark in an
 intent-to-use application where a notice of allowance has issued, the examining attorney
 has jurisdiction.  37 C.F.R. §2.84(a).  If the Deputy Commissioner determines that the
 letter of protest should be accepted and a statement of use has not been filed, the USPTO
 will cancel the notice of allowance and refund any fees paid for requests for an extension
 of time to file a statement of use.  Formal restoration of jurisdiction by the
 Commissioner is unnecessary.  
<b>
<a href="tmep-1100.html#TMEP-1100d1e545">TMEP §1106.03</a>
</b>.   Furthermore, if a
 statement of use has been filed, the examining attorney has jurisdiction and must review
 the statement of use and include any issues relevant to the statement of use in the Office
 action resulting from the letter of protest.  If an Office action regarding the statement
 of use has already issued, the examining attorney must issue a supplemental action
 regarding the refusals or requirements resulting from the letter of protest and
 incorporating by reference or restating any other outstanding refusals or
 requirements.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1700d1e973">1715.03(d)   Action by Examining Attorney After Publication</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e2491">If the USPTO accepts a letter of protest filed
 on the date of publication or after publication, the examining attorney must issue the
 refusal or requirement, except in unusual circumstances.  The examining attorney must
 inform the applicant that a letter of protest was accepted.  If the notice of allowance
 was cancelled, the examining attorney must so inform the applicant.  Before issuing the
 Office action with the refusal or requirement, the examining attorney must have the action
 reviewed by his or her managing attorney.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-4d130e2494">However, the acceptance of the letter of
 protest is not a final determination by the USPTO that registration must be refused.  In
 unusual circumstances, the examining attorney may discover additional evidence that would
 justify approval of the application for registration after acceptance of a letter of
 protest, or the applicant may overcome the refusal or satisfy the requirement.  If a
 letter of protest is accepted after publication and the examining attorney later
 determines that the mark should be approved for issuance of a registration or notice of
 allowance, the examining attorney must obtain permission from the Administrator for
 Trademark Policy and Procedure (“Administrator”) before approving the application for
 issue.  After conferring with the Administrator, an appropriate Note to the File must be
 entered in the record.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e2506">Filing a letter of protest does not stay or
 extend the opposition period.  Therefore, a party who files a letter of protest after
 publication should also file a timely request(s) for extension of time to oppose under 15
 U.S.C. §1063 with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.  See TBMP §215 for further
 information.  The Board will not suspend a potential opposer’s time to file a notice of
 opposition because a letter of protest has been filed.  See notice at 68 Fed. Reg. 55748,
 55760 (Sept. 26, 2003).

   Information for Parties Filing Letter of Protest
</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e2519">Third parties who object to the registration of
 a mark in a pending application must never contact an examining attorney directly, either by
 telephone or in writing.  Instead, they may submit a written request to the USPTO entitled
 “LETTER OF PROTEST.” A separate letter of protest, including relevant evidence, must be
 submitted for each application being protested. Each letter of protest must include the name
 and address of the protestor so that a response may be sent.
</p>
<p id="ch1700_d2240e_1d989_bd">If the letter of protest is accepted, only
 evidence relevant to examination of the mark, or the registration numbers or pending
 application serial numbers raised as potential cites, are forwarded to the examining
 attorney. Therefore, the letter of protest should include only a simple statement of the
 proposed legal grounds for refusing registration or making a requirement, with succinct,
 factual, objective evidence to support the refusal or requirement, and should not include
 arguments. If the evidence is not included, the letter of protest will be denied. 
</p>
<p id="ch1700_d2240e_1daa2_283">Note that a letter of protest should not include
 information or evidence concerning prior use, actual confusion, or fraudulent activity.
 These are not appropriate grounds for refusing registration during ex parte examination and
 must be addressed in an inter partes proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board
 or a civil court. 
<i>See</i>
<b>
<a href="tmep-1700.html#TMEP-1700d1e867">TMEP
 §1715.01
</a>
</b> for appropriate and inappropriate subjects to be raised in
 letter of protest. 
</p>
<p id="ch1700_d1b1b1_1b082_2a1">The type of evidence relevant to the examination
 of the mark depends upon the nature of the objection raised. For example, if an objection is
 filed on the basis that a mark, or portion of a mark, is descriptive or generic, the
 protestor must submit factual, objective evidence, such as descriptive or generic use by
 others or excerpts from the dictionary showing the meaning of the mark. Merely submitting a
 list of web sites is not sufficient, and a letter of protest that only includes such a list
 will be denied. If third-party registrations are offered to show that the mark or a portion
 of the mark is descriptive, generic, or so commonly used that the public will look to other
 elements to distinguish the source of the goods or services, a mere list of the
 registrations or copy of a search report is not proper evidence of such registrations.
 Rather, copies of the registrations or the electronic equivalent thereof (i.e., printouts or
 electronic copies of the registrations taken from the electronic database of the USPTO) must
 be submitted. 
<i>See</i>
<b>
<a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e6101">TMEP
 §1207.01(d)(iii)
</a>
</b>. 
</p>
<p id="ch1700_d2240e_1dc93_160">Generally, if an objection is based on a
 likelihood of confusion with existing federally registered marks or prior pending
 applications, and the goods and/or services are identical, third parties need only submit
 the relevant registration or application serial number(s). However, if there are multiple
 registration or application serial numbers that the protestor wants to be brought to the
 attention of the examining attorney, it is recommended that a chart listing the registration
 or serial numbers, the marks, and the goods and/or services be included. Such a chart must
 be provided on plain paper (not letterhead) or a PDF file with a plain background. To
 maintain the integrity of the ex parte examination process, the chart must not identify the
 protestor or its representatives or contain any arguments or persuasive language. If the
 goods and/or services are not identical, evidence of the relatedness of the goods and/or
 services must be included. Such evidence may include advertisements showing that the
 relevant goods/services are advertised together or sold by the same manufacturer or copies
 of registrations showing that such goods/services emanate from the same source. Note that a
 list of registration numbers, a chart containing the registration numbers and identified
 goods/services, or a copy of a search report is not proper evidence to show the relatedness
 of the goods or services in the registrations. Rather, copies of the registrations or the
 electronic equivalent thereof (i.e., printouts or electronic copies of the registrations
 taken from the electronic database of the USPTO) must be submitted.

</p>
<p id="ch1700_d22427_197e5_4b">A separate itemized index must accompany any
 submission of evidence exceeding 75 pages or the letter of protest may not be considered.
 Moreover, the Office encourages the use of an index in all letters of protests that contain
 multiple forms of evidence as its aids in the consideration of the details of all the
 evidence provided by the protestor. The index must be provided on plain paper (not
 letterhead), or a PDF file with a plain background, and contain a concise factual
 description of each category or form of evidence included. To maintain the integrity of the
 ex parte examination process, the index must not identify the protestor or its
 representatives or contain any arguments or persuasive language.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-3d130e2530">Because letters of protest are not part of the
 official application record, they must be properly designated and submitted to the USPTO.
  In order to ensure their proper routing and processing, the Office recommends that
 letters of protest be filed electronically via the Trademark Electronic Application System
 (“TEAS”). A separate letter of protest must be filed for each individual application that
 is being protested.  In TEAS, the Letter of Protest form can be accessed by clicking on
 the link entitled “Petition Forms” at 
<b>
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/teas/eTEAS/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/teas/</a>
</b>.  Otherwise, letters of protest
 should be faxed to the attention of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination
 Policy to the following fax number:  571-273-0032.  This is the only fax number that may
 be used.  Letters of protest may not be submitted by e-mail. Failure to submit the letter
 of protest properly may result in it being considered untimely.

</blockquote>
<p id="ch1700_d2240e_20e48_370">Duplicate copies of letters of protest
 regarding the same application should not be sent (e.g,, once electronically and then by
 mail or fax). Submission of duplicate documents can delay processing.

 letter of protest or uses a private courier service, the letter of protest must be
 delivered to the attention of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy at
 the Trademark Assistance Center, James Madison Building - East Wing, Concourse Level, 600
 Dulany Street, Alexandria, Virginia, and be clearly identified as a letter of
 protest.

 from the Deputy Commissioner accepting, denying, or holding moot the letter of protest,
 and should generally receive the response within 60 days of filing the letter.  The
 protestor should monitor the application status by checking the TSDR database at
 
<b>
<a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/" target="_blank">http://tsdr.uspto.gov/</a>
</b> to
 determine whether an action accepting the letter of protest has been taken.  This
 information will be in the public record only if the letter of protest is accepted.  If a
 protestor has not received a response within six months of submitting a letter of protest,
 the protestor should contact the Petitions Office to confirm receipt of the letter of
 protest.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1700-4d130e2576">Protestors should continue to monitor the
 status of the application being protested because the application may be approved for
 publication, republication, or issuance of a registration even after a letter of protest
 is accepted.  Ongoing monitoring will ensure protestors the opportunity to take other
 action (such as filing a notice of opposition) if the refusal or requirement raised as a
 result of the evidence referred by the letter of protest procedure is successfully
 overcome by the applicant.  A protestor may file a second letter of protest after
 publication only if a substantially different basis for filing the letter of protest is
 raised or significant additional evidence is provided that clearly establishes a prima
 facie case for refusal of registration.

 1451, Alexandria, Virginia  22313-1451 or fax the request to 571-273-0032.  All requests
 should be directed to the attention of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination

 forward a copy of the letter of protest and its attachment to the requester.  The Deputy
 Commissioner will deny the request for a copy of the letter of protest only if the letter of
 protest itself or its attachments contain material that would potentially be exempt from
 disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”).  If, in the opinion of the Deputy
 Commissioner, any part of the letter of protest or its attachments should be exempt from
 disclosure under FOIA, the matter will be forwarded to the Office of General Counsel of the
