</h4>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e10793">No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it .... (e) Consists of a mark which, (1) when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them....
</p>
</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e10796">Matter that “merely describes” the goods or services on or in connection with which it is used is not registrable on the Principal Register. As noted in <i>In re Abcor Dev. Corp.,</i> 588 F.2d 811, 813, 200 USPQ 215, 217 (C.C.P.A. 1978):

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-1d105e10804">The major reasons for not protecting such marks are: (1) to prevent the owner of a mark from inhibiting competition in the sale of particular goods; and (2) to maintain freedom of the public to use the language involved, thus avoiding the possibility of harassing infringement suits by the registrant against others who use the mark when advertising or describing their own products.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e6993">1209.01  Distinctiveness/Descriptiveness Continuum</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e10817">With regard to trademark significance, matter may be categorized along a continuum, ranging from marks that are highly distinctive to matter that is a generic name for the goods or services. The degree of distinctiveness – or, on the other hand, descriptiveness – of a designation can be determined only by considering it in relation to the specific goods or services. <i>Remington Products, Inc. v. N. Am. Philips Corp</i>., 892 F.2d 1576, 1580, 13 USPQ2d 1444, 1448 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (the mark must be considered in context, i.e.
<i>,</i> in connection with the goods).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e10826">At one extreme are marks that, when used in relation to the goods or services, are completely arbitrary or fanciful. Next on the continuum are suggestive marks, followed by merely descriptive matter. Finally, generic terms for the goods or services are at the opposite end of the continuum from arbitrary or fanciful marks. As stated in
<i> H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int'l Ass'n of Fire Chiefs, Inc.</i>, 782 F.2d 987, 989, 228 USPQ 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <i>quoting</i>
<i>Weiss Noodle Co. v. Golden Cracknel &amp; Specialty Co</i>., 290 F.2d 845, 847, 129 USPQ 411, 413 (C.C.P.A. 1961), “[t]he name of a thing is in fact the ultimate in descriptiveness.”
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e10837">Fanciful, arbitrary, and suggestive marks, often referred to as “inherently distinctive” marks, are registrable on the Principal Register without proof of acquired distinctiveness. <i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e7036">TMEP §1209.01(a)</a>

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e10847">Marks that are merely descriptive of the goods or services may not be registered on the Principal Register absent a showing of acquired distinctiveness under 15 U.S.C. §1052(f). See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e7074">TMEP §1209.01(b)</a>

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e7036">1209.01(a)  Fanciful, Arbitrary, and Suggestive Marks</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e10882">Fanciful marks comprise terms that have been invented for the sole purpose of functioning as a trademark or service mark. Such marks comprise words that are either unknown in the language (e.g., PEPSI, KODAK, and EXXON) or are completely out of common usage (e.g., FLIVVER).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e10885">Arbitrary marks comprise words that are in common linguistic use but, when used to identify particular goods or services, do not suggest or describe a significant ingredient, quality, or characteristic of the goods or services (e.g., APPLE for computers; OLD CROW for whiskey). <i>See, e.g., Palm Bay Imports, Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772</i>, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (VEUVE – meaning WIDOW in English – held to be “an arbitrary term as applied to champagne and sparkling wine, and thus conceptually strong as a trademark”); <i>Nautilus Grp., Inc. v. Icon Health &amp; Fitness, Inc.</i>, 372 F.3d 1330, 1340, 71 USPQ2d 1173, 1180 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (defining an arbitrary mark as “a known word used in an unexpected or uncommon way”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e10888">Suggestive marks are those that, when applied to the goods or services at issue, require imagination, thought, or perception to reach a conclusion as to the nature of those goods or services. Thus, a suggestive term differs from a descriptive term, which immediately tells something about the goods or services. <i>See In re George Weston Ltd., </i>228 USPQ 57 (TTAB 1985) (SPEEDI BAKE for frozen dough found to fall within the category of suggestive marks because it only vaguely suggests a desirable characteristic of frozen dough, namely, that it quickly and easily may be baked into bread); <i>In re The Noble Co.,</i> 225 USPQ 749 (TTAB 1985) (NOBURST for liquid antifreeze and rust inhibitor for hot-water-heating systems found to suggest a desired result of using the product rather than immediately informing the purchasing public of a characteristic, feature, function, or attribute);
<i> In re Pennwalt Corp.</i>, 173 USPQ 317 (TTAB 1972) (DRI-FOOT held suggestive of anti-perspirant deodorant for feet in part because, in the singular, it is not the usual or normal manner in which the purpose of an anti-perspirant and deodorant for the feet would be described).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e10901">Incongruity is a strong indication that a mark is suggestive rather than merely descriptive. <i>In re Tennis in the Round Inc.,</i> 199 USPQ 496, 498 (TTAB 1978) (TENNIS IN THE ROUND held not merely descriptive for providing tennis facilities, the Board finding that the association of applicant's marks with the phrase “theater-in-the-round” created an incongruity because applicant's tennis facilities are not at all analogous to those used in a “theater-in-the-round”). The Board has described incongruity in a mark as “one of the accepted guideposts in the evolved set of legal principles for discriminating the suggestive from the descriptive mark,” and has noted that the concept of mere descriptiveness “should not penalize coinage of hitherto unused and somewhat incongruous word combinations whose import would not be grasped without some measure of imagination and ‘mental pause.’” <i>In re Shutts</i>, 217 USPQ 363, 364–5 (TTAB 1983) (SNO-RAKE held not merely descriptive of a snow-removal hand tool); <i>see also</i>
<i>In re Vienna Sausage Mfg. Co.,</i> 156 USPQ 155, 156 (TTAB 1967) (FRANKWURST held not merely descriptive for wieners, the Board finding that although “frank” may be synonymous with “wiener,” and “wurst” is synonymous with “sausage,” the combination of the terms is incongruous and results in a mark that is no more than suggestive of the nature of the goods); <i>In re John H. Breck, Inc.,</i> 150 USPQ 397, 398 (TTAB 1966) (TINT TONE held suggestive for hair coloring, the Board finding that the words overlap in significance and their combination is somewhat incongruous or redundant and does not immediately convey the nature of the product); <i>cf. In re Getz Found.</i>, 227 USPQ 571, 572 (TTAB 1985) (MOUSE HOUSE held fanciful for museum services featuring mice figurines made up to appear as human beings, the Board finding that the only conceivable meaning of “mouse house,” i.e., a building at a zoo in which live and/or stuffed mice are displayed, is incongruous).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-7d105e10919">Suggestive marks, like fanciful and arbitrary marks, are registrable on the Principal Register without proof of secondary meaning. <i>See</i>
<i>Nautilus Grp., Inc. v. Icon Health &amp; Fitness, Inc.</i>, 372 F.3d 1330, 1340, 71 USPQ2d 1173, 1180 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Therefore, a designation does not have to be devoid of all meaning in relation to the goods/services to be registrable. If, after conducting independent research, it is unclear to the examining attorney whether a term in a mark has meaning in the relevant industry, the examining attorney must make an inquiry of the applicant, pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b). If the examining attorney determines that the term is arbitrary or fanciful, the examining attorney may enter a Note to the File in the record indicating that research was conducted regarding the meaning of the term in the relevant industry, without stating any legal opinions or conclusions.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e7074">1209.01(b)  Merely Descriptive Marks</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e10931">To be refused registration on the Principal Register under §2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1), a mark must be merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of the goods or services to which it relates. A mark is considered merely descriptive if it describes an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of the specified goods or services. <i>See In re Gyulay</i>, 820 F.2d 1216, 3 USPQ2d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (APPLE PIE held merely descriptive of potpourri);
<i> In re Bed &amp; Breakfast Registry</i>, 791 F.2d 157, 229 USPQ 818 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (BED &amp; BREAKFAST REGISTRY held merely descriptive of lodging reservations services);
<i> In re MetPath Inc.</i>, 223 USPQ 88 (TTAB 1984) (MALE-P.A.P. TEST held merely descriptive of clinical pathological immunoassay testing services for detecting and monitoring prostatic cancer);
<i> In re Bright-Crest, Ltd.</i>, 204 USPQ 591 (TTAB 1979) (COASTER-CARDS held merely descriptive of a coaster suitable for direct mailing). Similarly, a mark is considered merely descriptive if it immediately conveys knowledge of a quality, feature, function, or characteristic of an applicant’s goods or services. <i>In re Chamber of Commerce of the U.S.</i>, 675 F.3d 1297, 1300, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <i>In re Bayer Aktiengesellschaft</i>, 488 F.3d 960, 963-64, 82 USPQ2d 1828, 1831 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e10946">The determination of whether a mark is merely descriptive must be made in relation to the goods or services for which registration is sought, not in the abstract. <i>In re Chamber of Commerce</i>, 675 F.3d at 1300, 102 USPQ2d at 1219; <i>In re Bayer</i>, 488 F.3d at 964, 82 USPQ2d at 1831. This requires consideration of the context in which the mark is used or intended to be used in connection with those goods/services, and the possible significance that the mark would have to the average purchaser of the goods or services in the marketplace. <i>See</i>
<i>In re Chamber of Commerce</i>, 675 F.3d at 1300, 102 USPQ2d at 1219; <i>In re Bayer</i>, 488 F.3d at 964, 82 USPQ2d at 1831; <i>In re Omaha Nat’l Corp.</i>, 819 F.2d 1117, 2 USPQ2d 1859 (Fed. Cir. 1987);
<i> In re Abcor Dev. Corp.</i>, 588 F.2d 811, 200 USPQ 215 (C.C.P.A. 1978);
<i> In re Venture Lending Assocs.,</i> 226 USPQ 285 (TTAB 1985). The mark need not describe all the goods and services identified, as long as it merely describes one of them. <i>See In re Stereotaxis Inc.</i>, 429 F.3d 1039, 1041, 77 USPQ2d 1087, 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (“[T]he Trademark Office may require a disclaimer as a condition of registration if the mark is merely descriptive for at least one of the products or services involved.”)
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e10958">It is not necessary that a term describe all of the purposes, functions, characteristics, or features of a product to be considered merely descriptive; it is enough if the term describes one significant function, attribute, or property. <i>In re Chamber of Commerce</i>, 675 F.3d at 1300, 102 USPQ2d at 1219; <i>In re Oppedahl &amp; Larson LLP</i>, 373 F.3d 1171, 1173, 71 USPQ2d 1370, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (“A mark may be merely descriptive even if it does not describe the ‘full scope and extent’ of the applicant’s goods or services,” citing <i>In re Dial-A-Mattress Operating Corp.</i>, 240 F.3d 1341, 1346, 57 USPQ2d 1807, 1812 (Fed. Cir. 2001)); <i>Gyulay</i>, 820 F.2d at 1218, 3 USPQ2d at 1010; <i>In re Positec Group Ltd.</i>, 108 USPQ2d 1161, 1171 (TTAB 2013) (“[I]f the mark is descriptive of some identified items – or even just one – the whole class of goods still may be refused by the examiner.”); <i>In re Cox Enters. Inc.</i>, 82 USPQ2d 1040 (TTAB 2007) <i>see also In re Omaha Nat’l Corp.,</i>819 F.2d 1117, 1119, 2 USPQ2d 1859, 1861 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (rejecting argument that descriptiveness should be limited to a quality or characteristic of the service itself and holding that it includes a designation descriptive of the service provider).
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1ff63_19219_2f5">A term also may be considered merely descriptive if the identified services fall within a subset of services indicated by the term. <i>See In re Amer. Soc’y of Clinical Pathologists, Inc.</i>, 442 F.2d 1404, 1406-07, 169 USPQ 800, 801 (C.C.P.A. 1971) (holding that REGISTRY OF MEDICAL PATHOLOGISTS was descriptive of certain claimed services that were implicitly subsumed within service of providing a registry of medical pathologists and of additional claimed services that were “supporting, ancillary or auxiliary to the primary function” of applicant’s registry services). <i>See also In re Chamber of Commerce of the U.S.</i>, 675 F.3d 1297, 1301-02, 102 USPQ2d 1217, 1220 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (NATIONAL CHAMBER held descriptive because “substantial evidence supports the TTAB's determination that the designated business and regulatory data analysis services are within the scope of traditional chambers of commerce activities” of “promoting the interests of businessmen and businesswomen”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e10968">The great variation in facts from case to case prevents the formulation of specific rules for specific fact situations. Each case must be decided on its own merits. <i>See In re Ampco Foods, Inc.</i>, 227 USPQ 331 (TTAB 1985);
<i> In re Venturi, Inc.,</i> 197 USPQ 714 (TTAB 1977).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e11005">Generic terms are terms that the relevant purchasing public understands primarily as the common or class name for the goods or services. <i>In re Dial-A-Mattress Operating Corp.</i>, 240 F.3d 1341, 57 USPQ2d 1807, 1811 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <i>In re Am. Fertility Soc'y</i>, 188 F.3d 1341, 1346, 51 USPQ2d 1832, 1836 (Fed. Cir. 1999). These terms are incapable of functioning as registrable trademarks denoting source, and are not registrable on the Principal Register under §2(f) or on the Supplemental Register.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e11014">When a mark is comprised entirely of generic wording and some or all of the wording in the mark is the phonetic equivalent of the generic wording, the entire mark may not be disclaimed, even in the proper spelling, and approved for registration on the Supplemental Register. The disclaimer does not render an otherwise unregistrable generic mark registrable. <i>See</i> TMEP §§

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e11028">There is a two-part test used to determine whether a designation is generic: (1) What is the genus of goods or services at issue? and (2) Does the relevant public understand the designation primarily to refer to that genus of goods or services? <i>H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int'l Ass’n of Fire Chiefs, Inc.</i>, 782 F.2d 987, 990, 228 USPQ 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The test turns upon the primary significance that the term would have to the relevant public.
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1ff63_19151_3a8">The genus of the goods and/or services is often defined by an applicant’s identification of goods and/or services. <i>See</i>
<i>In re Cordua Rests. LP</i>, 110 USPQ2d 1227, 1229 (TTAB 2014) (citing <i>Magic Wand Inc. v. RDB Inc.</i>, 940 F.2d 638, 640, 19 USPQ2d 1551, 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). The relevant public for a genericness determination refers to the purchasing or consuming public for the identified goods and/or services. <i>Sheetz of Del., Inc. v. Doctor’s Assocs. Inc.</i>, 108 USPQ2d 1341, 1351 (TTAB 2013) (citing <i>Magic Wand Inc. v. RDB Inc.</i>, 940 F.2d at 641, 19 USPQ2d at 1553).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e11034">The examining attorney has the burden of proving that a term is generic by clear evidence. <i>In re Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.,</i> 828 F.2d 1567, 4 USPQ2d 1141 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Evidence of the public’s understanding of a term can be obtained from any competent source, including dictionary definitions, research databases, newspapers, and other publications. <i>See In re Northland Aluminum Products, Inc.</i>, 777 F.2d 1556, 227 USPQ 961 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (BUNDT, a term that designates a type of cake, held generic for ring cake mix, where the examining attorney cited cookbooks and food-related news articles); <i>In re Analog Devices Inc.</i>, 6 USPQ2d 1808 (TTAB 1988),
<i> aff’d,</i> 871 F.2d 1097, 10 USPQ2d 1879 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (ANALOG DEVICES held generic for devices having analog capabilities, where the examining attorney cited dictionaries and Nexis® articles). Applicant’s website and the websites of others are also proper sources of evidence as to the meaning of the proposed mark and the manner in which it is used in relation to the goods/services. <i> In re Reed Elsevier Properties Inc.</i>, 482 F.3d 1376, 82 USPQ2d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (In holding LAWYERS.COM generic for “providing an online interactive database featuring information exchange in the fields of law, legal news and legal services,” the Board properly considered applicant’s website and eight other websites containing "lawyer.com" or "lawyers.com" to determine the meaning of applicant’s “information exchange about legal services.”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e11049">It is not necessary to show that the relevant public <i>uses</i>the term to refer to the genus. The correct inquiry is whether the relevant public would understand the term to be generic. <i>In re 1800Mattress.com IP LLC,</i> 586 F.3d 1359, 92 USPQ2d 1682, 1685 (Fed. Cir. 2009).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e11059">There can be more than one generic term for a particular genus of goods or services. Any term that the relevant public understands to refer to the genus is generic. <i>Id. </i> at 1364, 92 USPQ2d at 1685.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-7d105e11065">When a term consists of a compound word or a telescoped word, the examining attorney may establish that the term is generic by producing evidence that each of the constituent words is generic, and that the separate words retain their generic significance when joined to form the compound or telescoped word that has “a meaning identical to the meaning common usage would ascribe to those words as a compound.” <i>In re Gould Paper Corp.,</i> 834 F.2d 1017, 1018, 5 USPQ2d 1110, 1111–12 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (SCREENWIPE held generic as applied to premoistened antistatic cloths for cleaning computer and television screens); <i>Frito-Lay N. Am., Inc. v. Princeton Vanguard, LLC</i>, 109 USPQ2d 1949, 1953 (TTAB 2014) (finding the term PRETZEL CRISPS, analyzed as a combined term, to be generic for “pretzel crackers,” but conclusion would be the same if analyzed as a unified phrase, as the words strung together would be understood by the relevant public as generic for pretzel crackers); <i>In re Greenliant Sys. Ltd.</i>, 97 USPQ2d 1078, 1081 (TTAB 2010) (finding that consumers were likely to perceive the telescoped term NANDRIVE merely as a stylized version of the generic term “nand drive”); <i>In re Wm. B. Coleman Co., Inc., </i>93 USPQ2d 2019 (TTAB 2010) (Board held that ELECTRIC CANDLE COMPANY is the combination of two generic terms joined to create a compound).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-8d105e11074">However, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has expressly limited the holding in <i>Gould</i> to “compound terms formed by the union of words” where the public understands the individual terms to be generic for a genus of goods or services, and the joining of the individual terms into one compound word lends “no additional meaning to the term.” <i>In re Dial-A-Mattress Operating Corp.</i>, 240 F.3d 1341, 57 USPQ2d 1807, 1810 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing <i>In re Am. Fertility Soc'y</i>, 188 F.3d 1341, 51 USPQ2d 1832, 1837 (Fed. Cir. 1999)). Where the mark is a phrase, the examining attorney cannot simply cite definitions and generic uses of the individual components of the mark, but must provide evidence of the meaning of the composite mark as a whole. In <i>Coleman</i>, however, the Board stated that <i>Am. Fertility Soc'y </i>cannot be read to suggest that an applicant can create a trademark by adding a clearly generic term to a non-source-identifying word, even in the absence of proof that others have used the composite. 93 USPQ2d 2019 at 2025.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-9d105e11092">In
<i> Am. Fertility Soc'y</i>, the court held that evidence that the components “Society” and “Reproductive Medicine” were generic was not enough to establish that the composite phrase SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE was generic for association services in the field of reproductive medicine. The court held that the examining attorney must show: (1) the genus of services that the applicant provides; and (2) that the relevant public understands the proposed composite mark to primarily refer to that genus of services. 51 USPQ2d at 1836–37.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-10d105e11098">In <i>Dial-A-Mattress</i>, the court held that an alphanumeric telephone number “bears closer conceptual resemblance to a phrase than a compound word.” 57 USPQ2d at 1811. The court found that 1-888-M-A-T-R-E-S-S was not generic as applied to “telephone shop-at-home retail services in the field of mattresses,” because there was no evidence of record that the public understood the term to refer to shop-at-home telephone mattress retailers. Therefore, to establish that a mnemonic telephone number is generic, the examining attorney must show that the relevant public would understand the mark as a whole to have generic significance.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-11d105e11104">With respect to Internet domain names, even if the evidence shows that the individual components that make up the proposed mark are generic, one must determine whether joining the individual terms creates a composite that is itself generic. In very rare instances, the addition of a top-level domain indicator (“TLD”) to an otherwise generic term may operate to create a distinctive mark. In <i>In re Steelbuilding.com,</i> 415 F.3d 1293, 1299, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1423 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the Federal Circuit reversed the Board’s determination that STEELBUILDING.COM is generic for “computerized on-line retail services in the field of pre-engineered metal buildings and roofing systems.” The Court criticized the Board for considering STEELBUILDING and .COM separately, stating that “[i]n this unusual case, the addition of the TLD indicator expanded the meaning of the mark to include goods and services beyond the mere sale of steel buildings. Specifically, the TLD expanded the mark to include internet services that include ‘building’ or designing steel structures on the website and then calculating an appropriate price before ordering the unique structure.”
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-12d105e11111">The Court also criticized the Board for relying only on evidence that the separate terms “steel building” or “steel buildings” are generic, where the terms were joined together in the subject mark:
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-1d105e11116">The record does not contain any examination of dictionary definitions or other sources that might have indicated that joining the separate words “steel” and “building” would create a word that, in context, would be generic. The Board merely cited evidence that showed that when customers or competitors talked about a steel building, they used the phrase “steel building.” That evidence shows that “steel building” is generic, but does not address directly the composite term STEELBUILDING.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-14d105e11120">415 F.3d at 1298–1299, 75 USPQ2d at 1423.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-15d105e11123">Thus, to establish that a proposed mark comprising an Internet domain name is generic, the examining attorney must show that the relevant public would understand the mark as a whole to have generic significance. <i>See</i>
<i>1800Mattress.com,</i>586 F.3d at 1363, 92 USPQ2d at 1684 (affirming Board’s conclusion that MATTRESS.COM was generic for “online retail store services in the field of mattresses, beds, and bedding,” where the Board considered each of the constituent words, “mattress” and “.com” and determined that they were both generic, then considered the mark as a whole and determined that the combination added no new meaning, relying on the prevalence of the term “mattress.com” in the website addresses of several online mattress retailers who provide the same services as the applicant); <i>In re Hotels.com, L.P.,</i> 573 F.3d 1300, 91 USPQ2d 1532 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (HOTELS.COM is generic for “providing information for others about temporary lodging; [and] travel agency services, namely, making reservations and bookings for temporary lodging for others by means of telephone and the global computer network,” based on various definitions of "hotel," printouts from hotel reservation search websites showing "hotels" as the equivalent of or included within “temporary lodging,” as well as evidence from applicant’s website); <i>In re DNI Holdings Ltd.</i>, 77 USPQ2d 1435 (TTAB 2005) (SPORTSBETTING.COM held generic for “provision of casino games on and through a global computer network wherein there are no actual monetary wagers; provision of contests and sweepstakes on and through a global computer network; providing a website on and through a global computer network featuring information in the fields of gaming, athletic competition and entertainment...,” where the record included multiple examples of use of the terms “sports betting” as well as the jointed terms “sportsbetting” by both applicant and its competitors to refer to both sports wagering and providing information about sports wagering, and there was no indication of a realistic alternative connotation of the compound term.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e7241">1209.01(c)(ii)  Terminology</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e11148">As specifically amended by the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, §14 of the Trademark Act provides for the cancellation of a registration of a mark at any time if the mark “becomes the generic name for the goods or services, or a portion thereof, for which it is registered....” 15 U.S.C. §1064(3). Previously, that provision had pertained to a mark that “becomes the common descriptive name of an article or substance....” Cases previously distinguished between generic names and “apt or common descriptive names,” which referred to matter that, while not characterized as “generic,” had become so associated with the product that it was recognized in the applicable trade as another name for the product, serving as a term of art for all goods of that description offered by different manufacturers rather than identifying the goods of any one producer. <i>See Questor Corp. v. Dan Robbins &amp; Assocs., Inc.,</i> 199 USPQ 358, 364 (TTAB 1978),
<i> aff’d,</i> 599 F.2d 1009, 202 USPQ 100 (C.C.P.A. 1979). In addition, the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988 amended §15 of the Trademark Act to adopt the term “generic name” to refer to generic designations. 15 U.S.C. §1065(4). In view of the amendment of §§14 and 15, a distinction between “generic” names and “apt or common descriptive” names is inappropriate. Rather, the terminology of the Act must be consistently used, e.g., in refusals to register matter that is a generic name for the goods or services, or a portion thereof. <i>See In re K-T Zoe Furniture Inc.</i>, 16 F.3d 390, 29 USPQ2d 1787 (Fed. Cir. 1994).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e11160">Similarly, cases have distinguished between “generic” terms and terms that were deemed “so highly descriptive as to be incapable of exclusive appropriation as a trademark.” <i>See In re Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc.,</i> 222 USPQ 820 (TTAB 1984) (LAW &amp; BUSINESS held so highly descriptive as to be incapable of distinguishing applicant’s services of arranging and conducting seminars in the field of business law);
<i> In re Industrial Relations Counselors, Inc.</i>, 224 USPQ 309 (TTAB 1984) (INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COUNSELORS, INC. held an apt name or so highly descriptive of educational services in the industrial relations field that it is incapable of exclusive appropriation and registration, notwithstanding
<i> de facto</i> source recognition capacity). Regarding current practice for refusing registration of such matter, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board noted as follows in In
<i> re Women’s Publ'g Co. Inc.</i>, 23 USPQ2d 1876, 1877 n.2 (TTAB 1992):
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-1d105e11177">The Examining Attorney’s refusal that applicant’s mark is “so highly descriptive that it is incapable of acting as a trademark” is not technically a statutory ground of refusal. Where an applicant seeks registration on the Principal Register, the Examining Attorney may refuse registration under Section 2(e)(1) of the Act, 15 USC 1052(e)(1), on the basis that the mark sought to be registered is generic (citations omitted). Alternatively, an Examining Attorney may refuse registration under the same section if he or she believes that the mark is merely descriptive and that applicant’s showing of acquired distinctiveness is unpersuasive of registrability.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e11182">In essence, the Board was merely emphasizing the need to use precise statutory language in stating grounds for refusal. While the decision does not explicitly bar the use of the terminology “so highly descriptive that it is incapable of acting as a trademark” under all circumstances, the case illustrates that the use of this terminology may lead to confusion and should be avoided. It is particularly important in this context to use the precise statutory language to avoid doctrinal confusion. <i>See generally</i> McLeod, <i>The Status of So Highly Descriptive and Acquired Distinctiveness</i>, 82 Trademark Rep. 607 (1992). Therefore, examining attorneys must not state that a mark is “so highly descriptive that it is incapable of acting as a trademark” in issuing refusals. Rather, in view of the amendments of the Trademark Act noted above, the terminology “generic name for the goods or services” must be used in appropriate refusals, and use of the terminology “so highly descriptive” must be discontinued when referring to incapable matter.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-7d105e11191">This does not mean that designations that might formerly have been categorized as “so highly descriptive” should not be regarded as incapable. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has specifically stated that “a phrase or slogan can be so highly laudatory and descriptive as to be incapable of acquiring distinctiveness as a trademark.” <i>In re Boston Beer Co. L.P.</i>, 198 F.3d 1370, 1373, 53 USPQ2d 1056, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (THE BEST BEER IN AMERICA for beer and ale held to be “so highly laudatory and descriptive of the qualities of [applicant’s] product that the slogan does not and could not function as a trademark to distinguish Boston Beer’s goods and serve as a indication of origin”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-8d105e11197">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has also stated that “[t]he critical issue in genericness cases is whether members of the relevant public primarily use or understand the term sought to be registered to refer to the genus of goods or services in question.” <i>H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int'l Ass’n of Fire Chiefs, Inc.</i>, 782 F.2d 987, 989–990, 228 USPQ 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Also, note that it is entirely appropriate to consider whether a particular designation is “highly descriptive” in evaluating registrability under §2(f), or in similar circumstances.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-9d105e11203">The expression “generic name for the goods or services” is not limited to noun forms but also includes “generic adjectives,” that is, adjectives that refer to a genus, species, category, or class of goods or services. <i>See Sheetz of Del., Inc. v. Doctor’s Assocs. Inc.</i>, 108 USPQ2d 1341 (TTAB 2013) (holding FOOTLONG generic for sandwiches, excluding hot dogs); <i>In re Reckitt &amp; Colman, N. Am. Inc.</i>, 18 USPQ2d 1389 (TTAB 1991) (holding PERMA PRESS generic for soil and stain removers for use on permanent press products). Similarly, evidence showing that a term in singular form is generic typically will suffice to show that the plural also is generic. <i>See In re Hotels.com, L.P.</i>, 573 F.3d 1300, 91 USPQ2d 1532, 1535 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (dictionary and other evidence of meaning of “hotel” sufficed to show that the plural form in HOTELS.COM was generic for the information and reservation services at issue); <i>In re Cordua Rests. LP</i>, 110 USPQ2d 1227, 1232 (TTAB 2014) (finding that evidence established not only that the singular form is generic, but also that the plural form CHURRASCOS is generic for applicant's restaurant services).

This would be especially appropriate for goods or services where the meaning of the mark or the nature of the goods or services would be readily apparent only to someone knowledgeable in that field. The examining attorney should also do any necessary research to determine the nature of the use of the designation in the marketplace. To the fullest extent possible, the examining attorney will examine §1(b) applications for registrability under §2(e)(1) according to the same procedures and standards that apply to any other application. <i>See</i>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e11384">A designation that is merely descriptive must be refused registration under §2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1). The examining attorney must not initially issue a refusal in an application for registration on the Principal Register on the ground that a mark is a generic name for the goods or services, unless the applicant asserts that the mark has acquired distinctiveness under §2(f) in the application itself. <i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e7529">TMEP §1209.02(b)</a>
. Even if it appears that the mark is generic, the proper basis for the initial refusal is §2(e)(1) descriptiveness. If there is strong evidence that the proposed mark is generic, a statement that the subject matter appears to be a generic name for the goods or services should be included in conjunction with the refusal on the ground that the matter is merely descriptive. It has been said that a generic term is “the ultimate in descriptiveness.” <i>H. Marvin Ginn Corp. v. Int'l Ass’n of Fire Chiefs, Inc.</i>, 782 F.2d 987, 989, 228 USPQ 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1986), quoting <i>Weiss Noodle Co. v. Golden Cracknel &amp; Specialty Co</i>., 290 F.2d 845, 847, 129 USPQ 411, 413 (C.C.P.A. 1961).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e11399">If, on the other hand, the mark appears to be capable, the examining attorney should provide appropriate advice concerning a possible amendment to the Supplemental Register or assertion of a claim of acquired distinctiveness. See <a href="tmep-1100.html#TMEP-1100d1e60">TMEP §1102.03</a>
 concerning ineligibility of the proposed mark in a §1(b) application for the Supplemental Register prior to filing an acceptable amendment to allege use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(c) or statement of use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(d). The examining attorney should also advise the applicant regarding any incapable portion of the mark for which a disclaimer would be required in connection with an amendment to the Supplemental Register or assertion of a claim of acquired distinctiveness. If the applicant responds by amending to the Supplemental Register or asserting acquired distinctiveness, but does not submit the disclaimer, the examining attorney must issue a nonfinal Office action. Prior to the applicant’s amendment, information regarding the disclaimer requirement is merely advisory. Failure to submit the disclaimer thus would constitute a new issue requiring a nonfinal Office action.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e11408">If the record is unclear as to whether the designation is capable of functioning as a mark, the examining attorney must refrain from giving any advisory statement. In general, the examining attorney should make every effort to apprise applicants as early as possible of the prospects for registration through appropriate amendments, if feasible. <i>NOTE:</i>
<i>A mark in a §66(a) application cannot be registered on the Supplemental Register under any circumstances. 15 U.S.C. </i>§
<i>1141h(a)(4); 37 C.F.R. §§2.47(c) and 2.75(c).</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e11417">If, in response to a first-action refusal under §2(e)(1), the applicant merely argues that the mark is registrable on the Principal Register without claiming acquired distinctiveness or amending to the Supplemental Register, the examining attorney must issue a final refusal under §2(e)(1), on the ground that the proposed mark is merely descriptive, if he or she is not persuaded by the applicant’s arguments.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e11428">If the applicant responds to a §2(e)(1) descriptiveness refusal by amending its application to the Supplemental Register, this amendment presents a new issue requiring consideration by the examining attorney (unless the amendment is irrelevant to the outstanding refusal). <i>See</i> TMEP §

<a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e1938">714.05(a)(i)</a>
. If the examining attorney determines that the designation is a generic name for the applicant’s goods or services, the examining attorney must then issue a nonfinal action refusing registration on the Supplemental Register. The statutory basis for such a refusal is §23 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1091. See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e2627">TMEP §§815–816.05</a>

. If the examining attorney determines that the designation is a generic name for the applicant’s goods or services, the examining attorney must issue a new nonfinal action refusing registration under §2(e)(1) on the basis that the mark is generic and stating that the claim of acquired distinctiveness is insufficient to overcome the refusal. The examining attorney must also maintain and continue, in the alternative, the refusal under §2(e)(1) that the mark is merely descriptive and must separately explain why the showing of acquired distinctiveness is insufficient to overcome the descriptiveness refusal even if the mark is ultimately deemed not to be generic. As the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board noted in <i>In re Women’s Publ'g Co. Inc.</i>, 23 USPQ2d 1876, 1877 n.2 (TTAB 1992):
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-1d105e11466">The Examining Attorney’s refusal that applicant’s mark is “so highly descriptive that it is incapable of acting as a trademark” is not technically a statutory ground of refusal. Where an applicant seeks registration on the Principal Register, the Examining Attorney may refuse registration under Section 2(e)(1) of the Act, 15 USC 1052(e)(1), on the basis that the mark sought to be registered is generic. <i>See, e.g., In re Northland Aluminum Products Inc</i>., 777 F.2d 1556, 227 USPQ 961, 962 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <i>Weiss Noodle Co. v. Golden Cracknel &amp; Specialty Co</i>., 290 F.2d 845, 129 USPQ 411, 413 (C.C.P.A. 1961), <i>In re Deutsche Airbus GmbH</i>, 224 USPQ 611 (TTAB 1984) and <i>Conde Nast Publ'ns Inc. v. Redbook Publ'g Co</i>., 217 USPQ 356, 360 (TTAB 1983). Alternatively, an Examining Attorney may refuse registration under the same section if he or she believes that the mark is merely descriptive and that applicant’s showing of acquired distinctiveness is unpersuasive of registrability.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e11482">If the examining attorney fails to separately address the sufficiency of the §2(f) evidence, this may be treated as a concession that the evidence would be sufficient to establish distinctiveness if the mark is ultimately found not to be generic. <i>See In re Country Music Ass’n</i>, 100 USPQ2d 1824, 1834 (TTAB 2011) (interpreting the examining attorney’s silence on the sufficiency of the evidence submitted in support of applicant’s claim of acquired distinctiveness “as a concession that, if the term is not generic, the record evidence is sufficient to show acquired distinctiveness under Section 2(f)”). <i>Compare In re Dietrich,</i> 91 USPQ2d 1622, 1625 (TTAB 2009), in which the Board held that an examining attorney had “effectively conceded that, assuming the mark is not functional, applicant’s evidence is sufficient to establish that the mark had acquired distinctiveness,” where the examining attorney rejected the applicant’s §2(f) claim on the ground that applicant’s bicycle wheel configuration was functional and thus unregistrable even under §2(f), but did not specifically address the sufficiency of the §2(f) evidence or the question of whether the mark would be registrable under §2(f) if it were ultimately found to be nonfunctional.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e11489">Therefore, the descriptiveness refusal must be maintained, in the alternative, in the event that the mark is ultimately determined not to be generic. See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e10316">TMEP §§1212–1212.10</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e11582">Third-party registrations are not conclusive on the question of descriptiveness. Each case must stand on its own merits, and a mark that is merely descriptive must not be registered on the Principal Register simply because other such marks appear on the register. <i> In re theDot Commc’ns Network LLC</i>, 101 USPQ2d 1062, 1067 (TTAB 2011) (holding .music merely descriptive for, inter alia, on-line social networking services, domain registration services, interactive hosting services, electronic publishing, recording, and production services, online retail store and promotional services, and downloadable files and recordings despite the presence of third-party registrations for marks consisting of “dot ____” or “.____”); <i>In re Scholastic Testing Serv., Inc.</i>, 196 USPQ 517, 519 (TTAB 1977) (holding SCHOLASTIC merely descriptive of devising, scoring, and validating tests for others despite the presence of other marks on the Register using the word “Scholastic”).

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e11687">However, a mark comprising a combination of merely descriptive components is registrable if the combination of terms creates a unitary mark with a unique, nondescriptive meaning, or if the composite has a bizarre or incongruous meaning as applied to the goods. <i>See In re Colonial Stores Inc.</i>, 394 F.2d 549, 157 USPQ 382 (C.C.P.A. 1968) (SUGAR &amp; SPICE held not merely descriptive of bakery products); <i>In re Shutts,</i> 217 USPQ 363 (TTAB 1983) (SNO-RAKE held not merely descriptive of a snow removal hand tool).

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-7d105e11718">The addition of an entity designator (e.g., Corporation, Corp., Co., Inc., Ltd., etc.) to a descriptive term does not alter the term’s descriptive significance, because an entity designation has no source-indicating capacity. <i>See Goodyear’s India Rubber Glove Mfg.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e11754">Descriptiveness must be determined in relation to the goods or services for which registration is sought. Therefore, the fact that a term may have a different meaning(s) in a different context is not controlling. <i>See</i>
<i>In re RiseSmart Inc</i>., 104 USPQ2d 1931, 1933 (TTAB 2012); <i>In re Chopper Indus</i>., 222 USPQ 258, 259 (TTAB 1984); <i>In re Bright-Crest, Ltd.</i>, 204 USPQ 591, 593 (TTAB 1979); <i>In re Champion Int’l Corp.,</i> 183 USPQ 318, 320 (TTAB 1974). If a term has a primary significance that is descriptive in relation to at least one of the recited goods/services, and does not create any double entendre or incongruity, then the term is merely descriptive.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e11804">The foreign equivalent of a merely descriptive English word is no more registrable than the English word itself. “[A] word taken from a well-known foreign modern language, which is, itself, descriptive of a product, will be so considered when it is attempted to be registered as a trade-mark in the United States for the same product.” <i>In re N. Paper Mills</i>, 64 F.2d 998, 1002, 17 USPQ 492, 493 (C.C.P.A. 1933). <i>See</i>
<i>In re Tokutake Indus. Co.</i>, 87 USPQ2d 1697 (TTAB 2008) (AYUMI and its Japanese-character equivalent held merely descriptive for footwear where the evidence, including applicant's own admissions, indicated that the primary meaning of applicant's mark is “walking”); <i>In re Oriental Daily News, Inc</i>., 230 USPQ 637 (TTAB 1986) (Chinese characters that mean ORIENTAL DAILY NEWS held merely descriptive of newspapers); <i>In re Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co.,</i> 227 USPQ 813 (TTAB 1985) (SAPORITO, an Italian word meaning “tasty,” held merely descriptive because it describes a desirable characteristic of applicant’s dry sausage).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e11819">Although words from modern languages are generally translated into English, the doctrine of foreign equivalents is not an absolute rule, but merely a guideline. The doctrine should be applied only when it is likely that the ordinary American purchaser would stop and translate the foreign word into its English equivalent. <i>See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee en 1772</i>, 396 F.3d 1369, 1377, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1696 (Fed. Cir. 2005). “The "ordinary American purchaser" in this context refers to the ordinary American purchaser who is knowledgeable in the foreign language.…[defining “ordinary American purchaser” as the “average American buyer”] would write the doctrine out of existence” <i>In re Thomas</i>, 79 USPQ2d 1021, 1024 (TTAB 2006). The “ordinary American purchaser” includes “all American purchasers, including those proficient in a non-English language who would ordinarily be expected to translate words into English.” <i>In re Spirits Int’l, N.V.</i>, 563 F.3d 1347, 1352, 90 USPQ2d 1489, 1492 (Fed. Cir. 2009).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e11825">While foreign words are generally translated into English for purposes of determining descriptiveness, foreign words from dead or obscure languages may be so unfamiliar to the American buying public that they should not be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes. <i>See Enrique Bernat F. S.A. v. Guadalajara Inc</i>., 210 F.3d 439, 443, 54 USPQ2d 1497, 1499 (5th Cir. 2000), <i>reh’g denied</i> 218 F.3d 745 (2000); <i>cf. Gen. Cigar Co. v. G.D.M. Inc</i>., 988 F. Supp. 647, 45 USPQ2d 1481 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). The determination of whether a language is “dead” must be made on a case-by-case basis, based upon the meaning that the term would have to the relevant purchasing public.
</p>
<div id="" class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-1d105e11840">
<i>Example:</i> Latin is generally considered a dead language. However, if evidence exists that the relevant purchasing public still uses a Latin term (e.g.
<i>,</i> if the term appears in current dictionaries or news articles), then that Latin term is not considered dead. The same analysis should be applied to other uncommon languages.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-7d105e11849">Note that marks comprised of a term from a foreign language used with an English term may be found registrable if the commercial impression created by the combination differs from that which would be created by two English words. <i>See In re Johanna Farms Inc.,</i> 8 USPQ2d 1408 (TTAB 1988) (LA YOGURT for yogurt registrable on Principal Register with a disclaimer of “YOGURT”); <i>In re Sweet Victory, Inc.,</i> 228 USPQ 959 (TTAB 1986) (GLACE LITE held not descriptive for ice creams, sherbets, frozen yogurts, and nondairy frozen desserts);

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e11882">As a general rule, an acronym or initialism cannot be considered descriptive unless the wording it stands for is merely descriptive of the goods or services, and the acronym or initialism is readily understood by relevant purchasers to be "substantially synonymous" with the merely descriptive wording it represents. <i>See</i>
<i>Modern Optics Inc. v. The Univis Lens Co.,</i> 234 F. 2d 504, 506, 110 USPQ 293, 295 (C.C.P.A. 1956); <i>Baroness Small Estates, Inc. v. Am.

A mark consisting of an abbreviation, initialism, or acronym will be considered substantially synonymous with descriptive wording if: (1) the applied-for mark is an abbreviation, initialism, or acronym for specific wording; (2) the specific wording is merely descriptive of applicant’s goods and/or services; and (3) a relevant consumer viewing the abbreviation, initialism, or acronym in connection with applicant’s goods and/or services will recognize it as an abbreviation, initialism, or acronym of the merely descriptive wording that it represents. <i>See</i>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e11990">If an applicant applies to register a designation that consists of a merely descriptive term with numerals in the form of an alphanumeric telephone number (e.g., 800, 888, or 900 followed by a word), the examining attorney must refuse registration under §2(e)(1). <i>See In re Page</i>, 51 USPQ2d 1660 (TTAB 1999) (888 PATENTS merely descriptive of patent-related legal services). The fact that a designation is in the form of a telephone number is insufficient, by itself, to render it distinctive.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e11996">If the relevant term is merely descriptive, but not generic, the mark may be registered on the Principal Register with a proper showing of acquired distinctiveness under §2(f), or on the Supplemental Register, if appropriate. <i>See Express Mortg. Brokers Inc. v. Simpson Mortg. Inc., </i>31 USPQ2d 1371, 1374 (E.D. Mich. 1994) (369-CASH held merely descriptive but shown to have acquired distinctiveness as applied to mortgage brokering and mortgage-related services). Of course, the designation must also be used in the manner of a mark. See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e718">TMEP §§1202–1202.16</a>
 regarding use as a mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e12011">If the proposed mark is generic, the designation is unregistrable on either the Principal or the Supplemental Register. However, to support a refusal of registration on the ground that a telephone number is generic, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that it is not enough to show that the telephone number consists of a non-source-indicating area code and a generic term. The examining attorney must show evidence of the meaning the relevant purchasing public accords the proposed alphanumeric mark as a whole. <i>In re Dial-A-Mattress Operating Corp.</i>, 240 F.3d 1341, 57 USPQ2d 1807, 1811 (Fed.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e7919">1209.03(m)  Domain Names</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e12037">A mark comprised of an Internet domain name is registrable as a trademark or service mark only if it functions as an identifier of the source of goods or services. Portions of the uniform resource locator (“URL”), including the beginning, (“http://www.”) and the top-level Internet domain name (“TLD”) (e.g., “.com,” “.org,” “.edu,”) indicate an address on the World Wide Web, and, therefore, generally serve no source-indicating function. See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e12651">TMEP §§1215–1215.10</a>
 for further information.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e12049">If a TLD has three or more characters, it is known as a “generic top-level domain” or “gTLD.” However “generic” in this term does not refer to genericness in the trademark sense. The gTLD typically signifies the type of entity using the domain name. For example, the gTLD “.com” signifies to the public that the user of the domain name constitutes a commercial entity, “.edu” signifies an educational institution, “.biz” signifies a business, and “.org” signifies a non-commercial organization. These types of gTLDs, which merely indicate the type of entity using the gTLD, must be treated as non-source-indicating. Further, as the number of available gTLDs is increased by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), or if the nature of new gTLDs changes, the examining attorney must consider any potential source-indicating function of the gTLD and introduce evidence as to the significance of the gTLD. See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e12845">TMEP §§1215.02(d)─1215.02(d)(iv)</a>
 regarding marks comprised solely of gTLDs for domain-name registry operator and registrar services and 

<a href="http://www.icann.org/" target="_blank">www.icann.org</a>
 for information about gTLDs. <i>Cf</i>. <i>In re theDot Commc’ns Network LLC</i>, 101 USPQ2d 1062, 1067 (TTAB 2011) (finding “.music conveys the commercial impression of a top-level domain name similar to .com, .net, etc.,” and that consumers would understand it to be a TLD in the field of music based on the current marketing environment which included evidence of a concerted effort to obtain TLD status for .music).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e12055">Because gTLDs generally indicate the type of entity using a given domain name, and therefore serve no source-indicating function, their addition to an otherwise unregistrable mark typically cannot render it registrable. <i>In re 1800Mattress.com IP LLC,</i> 586 F.3d 1359, 92 USPQ2d 1682 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (MATTRESS.COM generic for “online retail store services in the field of mattresses, beds, and bedding,” and applicant “presented no evidence that ".com" evoked anything but a commercial internet domain”); <i>In re Hotels.com, L.P.,</i> 573 F.3d 1300, 91 USPQ2d 1532 (Fed.

Cir. 2004) (PATENTS.COM merely descriptive of computer software for managing a database of records and for tracking the status of the records by means of the Internet);
<i> In re Eddie Z’s Blinds &amp; Drapery, Inc.</i>, 74 USPQ2d 1037 (TTAB 2005) (BLINDSANDDRAPERY.COM generic for retail store services featuring blinds, draperies and other wall coverings, sold via the Internet); <i>In re Microsoft Corp.,</i> 68 USPQ2d 1195, 1203 (TTAB 2003) (“The combination of the specific term and TLD at issue, i.e., OFFICE and .NET, does not create any double entendre, incongruity, or any other basis upon which we can find the composite any more registrable than its separate elements. The combination immediately informs prospective purchasers that the software includes ‘office suite’ type software and is from an Internet business, i.e., a ‘.net’ type business.”); <i>In re CyberFinancial.Net, Inc</i>., 65 USPQ2d 1789, 1792 (TTAB 2002) (“Applicant seeks to register the generic term ‘bonds,’ which has no source-identifying significance in connection with applicant’s services, in combination with the top level domain indicator “.com,” which also has no source-identifying significance. And combining the two terms does not create a term capable of identifying and distinguishing applicant’s services.”); <i>In re Martin Container, Inc.</i>, 65 USPQ2d 1058, 1061 (TTAB 2002) (“[N]either the generic term nor the domain indicator has the capability of functioning as an indication of source, and combining the two does not result in a compound term that has somehow acquired this capability.”). 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e12074">However, there is no bright-line, per se rule that the addition of a gTLD to an otherwise descriptive mark will never, under any circumstances, operate to create a registrable mark. <i>See Oppedahl &amp; Larson LLP</i>, 373 F.3d at 1175, 71 USPQ2d 1374. In rare instances, if the gTLD is capable of indicating a source, the addition of the source-indicating gTLD to an otherwise unregistrable mark may render it registrable.

<div id="" class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-1d105e12079">

<a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e12845">TMEP §1215.02(d)</a>
. Additionally, the Federal Circuit has cautioned that in rare, exceptional circumstances, a term that is not distinctive by itself may acquire some additional meaning from the addition of a non-source-indicating gTLD such as “.com” or “.net.” <i>In re Steelbuilding.com,</i> 415 F.3d 1293, 1297, 75 USPQ2d 1420, 1422 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (STEELBUILDING.COM for “computerized on line retail services in the field of pre-engineered metal buildings and roofing systems” held highly descriptive, but not generic), citing <i>Oppedahl &amp; Larson</i>, 373 F.3d at 1175–1176, 71 USPQ2d at 1373.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-9d105e12095">Thus, when examining domain-name marks, it is important to evaluate the commercial impression of the mark as a whole to determine whether the gTLD may be capable of source-indicating significance, and whether the composite mark conveys any distinctive source-identifying impression apart from its individual components. The examining attorney must introduce evidence as to the significance of the individual components, including the gTLD, but must also consider the significance of the composite to determine whether the addition of a gTLD has resulted in a mark that conveys a source-identifying impression. <i>See</i>
<i>In re 1800Mattress.com,</i> 92 USPQ2d 1682 (affirming Board’s conclusion that MATTRESS.COM was generic, where the Board considered each of the constituent words “mattress” and “.com” and determined that they were both generic, then considered the mark as a whole and determined that the combination added no new meaning, relying on the prevalence of the term “mattress.com” in the website addresses of several online mattress retailers who provide the same services as the applicant); <i>In re Hotels.com,</i> 91 USPQ2d 1532 (HOTELS.COM found generic, where the record contained various definitions of "hotel," printouts from hotel reservation search websites showing "hotels" as the equivalent of or included within "temporary lodging," as well as evidence from applicant’s website); <i>In re DNI Holdings Ltd.</i>, 77 USPQ2d 1435 (TTAB 2005) (SPORTSBETTING.COM held generic for providing online gaming services and information about sports and gaming, with the Board finding that “applicant's own website uses the expression ‘sports betting,’ e.g., touting itself as ‘the leader in online sports betting’ and providing tips on ‘sports betting’ as a game of skill.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e12356">Section 2(e)(1) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1), also prohibits registration of designations that are deceptively misdescriptive of the goods or services to which they are applied. The examining attorney must consider the mark in relation to the applicant’s goods or services to determine whether a mark is deceptively misdescriptive.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e12359">The examining attorney must first determine whether a term is misdescriptive as applied to the goods or services. A term that conveys an immediate idea of an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, or feature of the goods or services with which it is used is merely descriptive. <i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e7074">TMEP §1209.01(b)</a>
. If a term immediately conveys such an idea but the idea is false, although plausible, then the term is deceptively misdescriptive and is unregistrable under §2(e)(1). <i>See</i>
<i>In re AOP LLC</i>, 107 USPQ2d 1644 (TTAB 2013) (AOP deceptive, deceptively misdescriptive, or, alternatively, merely descriptive for wine, after the applicant failed to fully respond to the examining attorney’s inquiries regarding the origin and certification of applicant’s goods); <i>In re Woodward &amp; Lothrop Inc.</i>, 4 USPQ2d 1412 (TTAB 1987) (CAMEO deceptively misdescriptive of jewelry);

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e12374">The Trademark Act does not prohibit the registration of misdescriptive terms unless they are deceptively misdescriptive, that is, unless persons who encounter the mark, as used on or in connection with the goods or services in question, are likely to believe the misrepresentation. <i>See Binney &amp; Smith Inc. v. Magic Marker Indus., Inc.</i>, 222 USPQ 1003 (TTAB 1984) (LIQUID CRAYON held neither common descriptive name, nor merely descriptive, nor deceptively misdescriptive of coloring kits or markers).

</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-1d105e12389">The test for deceptive misdescriptiveness has two parts. First we must determine if the matter sought to be registered misdescribes the goods. If so, then we must ask if it is also deceptive, that is, if anyone is likely to believe the misrepresentation. <i>Gold Seal Co. v. Weeks,</i> 129 F. Supp. 928 (D.D.C. 1955),

<i>2001 v. Fame Jeans Inc.,</i>525 F.3d 8, 86 USPQ2d 1527, 1532 (D.C. Cir. 2008). A third question, used to distinguish between marks that are deceptive under Section 2(a) and marks that are deceptively misdescriptive under Section 2(e)(1), is whether the misrepresentation would materially affect the decision to purchase the goods. <i>Cf. In re House of Windsor, Inc.</i>, 221 USPQ 53 (TTAB 1983).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-8d105e12414">Thus, if the identification of goods/services does not include the wording in the mark, the examining attorney must make of record evidence demonstrating why the mark is misdescriptive. Specifically, the record must show the meaning of the wording at issue and that the identification indicates that the applicant’s goods/services lack the feature or characteristic. Examples of such evidence are dictionary definitions, LexisNexis® articles, Internet websites, advertising material, product information sheets, hang tags, point-of-purchase displays, and trade journals. The applicant’s admission regarding its goods/services may also satisfy the first prong of the test. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-9d105e12417">The examining attorney must then prove that the description conveyed by the mark is plausible by demonstrating that consumers regularly encounter goods or services that contain the features or characteristics in the mark. For example, to support the believability element as to the mark LOVEE LAMB for seat covers that were not made of lambskin, the examining attorney provided evidence that seat covers can be and are made from lambskin. <i>See In re Budge Mfg. Co. Inc.,</i> 857 F.2d 773, 775, 8 USPQ2d 1259, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Excerpts from a LexisNexis® search for the phrases “organic clothing,” “organic fabric,” “organically grown cotton,” and “organic cotton” were used to prove that consumers were familiar with clothing and textiles from organically grown plants or plants free of chemical processing or treatment. <i>See In re Organik Techs., Inc.,</i> 41 USPQ2d 1690, 1693–94 (TTAB 1997). Applicant’s own hang tags, labels, advertising, and product information may also provide evidence of the believability of the misdescription. <i>See</i>
<i>In re Shapely, Inc.,</i> 231 USPQ 72, 75 (TTAB 1986) (concluding that statements on hangtags can be used to show the materiality of the mispresentation in the purchasing decision); <i>Evans Products Co. v. Boise Cascade Corp.,</i> 218 USPQ 160, 164–5 (TTAB 1983) (finding that applicant’s advertising materials and affidavit indicated that it did attempt to “adopt a mark [CEDAR RIDGE] which conveyed the impression of authentic cedar”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-10d105e12434">If the misdescription represented by the mark is material to the decision to purchase the goods or use the services, then the mark must be refused registration under §2(a) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1052(a).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-11d105e12452">The examining attorney should consider and make of record, or require the applicant to make of record, all available information that shows the presence or absence, and the materiality, of a misrepresentation. <i>See Glendale Int’l Corp. v.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-12d105e12459">The mere fact that the true nature of the goods or services is revealed by other matter on the labels, advertisements, or other materials to which the mark is applied does not preclude a determination that a mark is deceptively misdescriptive. <i>See R. Neumann &amp; Co. v. Overseas Shipments, Inc.</i>, 326 F.2d 786, 790, 140 USPQ 276, 279 (C.C.P.A. 1964) (DURA-HYDE held deceptive and deceptively misdescriptive of plastic material of leather-like appearance made into shoes regardless of the presence of tags stating that the material “outwears leather”); <i>In re Shniberg</i>, 79 USPQ2d 1309, 1313 (TTAB 2006) (SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 held deceptively misdescriptive of books and entertainment services which did not in any way cover the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; the fact that the nature of the misdescription would become known after consumers studied applicant’s books and entertainment services does not prevent the mark from being deceptively misdescriptive).
