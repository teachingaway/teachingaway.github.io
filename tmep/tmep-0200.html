<p id="TMEP-ch-200-3d55e18">In an application under §1 or §44 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051 or §1126, the filing date of an application is the date on which all the elements set forth in 37 C.F.R. §2.21(a) (
<i>see</i>

<a href="tmep-0200.html#TMEP-200d1e41">TMEP §202</a>
) are received in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-200-4d55e24">In a request for an extension of protection of an international registration to the United States under §66(a) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1141f(a), the filing date is:  (1) the international registration date, if the request for extension of protection to the United States is made in an international application; or (2) the date that the subsequent designation was recorded by the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (“IB”), if the request for extension of protection to the United States is made in a subsequent designation.  15 U.S.C. §1141f(b); 37 C.F.R. §7.26.  See <a href="tmep-1900.html#TMEP-1900d1e982">TMEP §§1904</a>

<i>et seq.</i> for further information about §66(a) applications.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-200-5d55e33">Granting a filing date to an application does not necessarily mean that all requirements for registration have been satisfied.  It is possible that registration could be refused on a substantive ground.  See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e2784">TMEP §818</a>
 for a list of potential grounds of refusal.  If registration is not refused on any substantive basis (or if the applicant overcomes any substantive refusals), the applicant must comply with any procedural requirements issued by the examining attorney during examination, in accordance with applicable rules and statutes, in order to obtain a registration.

<li class="nobull">(1) The name of the applicant;

<i>Kraft Group LLC v. Harpole</i>, 90 USPQ2d 1837 (TTAB 2009) (use in commerce is not required for receipt of a filing date for an application requesting registration on the Supplemental Register).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-200-6d55e148">If an application does not satisfy all the above requirements, it will not be given a filing date.  The USPTO will notify the applicant of the reason(s) why the application was not given a filing date, and refund the application filing fee.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-200-7d55e152">The applicant must provide a physical address to which paper correspondence can be mailed in order to receive a filing date.  An e-mail address and authorization to send communications by e-mail cannot be substituted for a physical address.  A post office box is acceptable.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-200-8d55e155">Applications that do not meet the minimum requirements for receipt of a filing date are referred to as “informal.”  See <a href="tmep-0200.html#TMEP-200d1e219">TMEP §203</a>

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-200-4d55e193">Under 37 C.F.R. §2.21(a)(3), a §1 or §44 applicant must submit “a clear drawing of the mark” to receive a filing date, except in applications for registration of sound, scent, and other non-visual marks.  A separate drawing page (or digital image of a separate drawing page in an application filed through the Trademark Electronic Application System (“TEAS”)) is not mandatory, but is encouraged.  See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1656">TMEP §807.09</a>
 regarding “drawings” in applications for registration of non-visual marks.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-200-5d55e199">A "drawing" is simply a depiction of the mark for which registration is sought.  37 C.F.R. §2.52.  A drawing that includes multiple elements that do not comprise an identifiable mark, or that consists of wording describing the mark, does not constitute a clear drawing of the mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-200-6d55e203">An application that includes two or more drawings displaying materially different marks does not meet the requirement for a “clear drawing of the mark.”  Therefore, an application is denied a filing date if it includes two or more drawings displaying materially different marks.

<i>Humanoids Group v. Rogan,</i>
<i>375 F.3d 301</i>, 71 USPQ2d 1745 (4th Cir. 2004).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-200-7d55e209">However, if an applicant (1) submits a separate drawing page showing a mark in a paper application, (2) enters a standard character mark in the “Mark Information” field of an application filed through TEAS, or (3) attaches a .jpg file containing a mark to the “Mark Information” field of a TEAS application, and a different mark appears elsewhere in the application, the drawing page or mark shown in the “Mark Information” field on TEAS will control for purposes of determining the nature and elements of the mark.  The USPTO will grant a filing date to the application, and disregard any other mark that appears elsewhere in the application.  The applicant will not be permitted to amend the mark if the amendment is a material alteration of the mark on the drawing page in a paper application or the “Mark Information” field in a TEAS application.  
<i>In re L.G. Lavorazioni Grafite S.r.l.</i>, 61 USPQ2d 1063 (Dir USPTO 2001).  See 37 C.F.R. §2.72 and
