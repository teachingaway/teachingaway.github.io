<div>Service Marks, Collective Marks, and Certification Marks
<div xmlns="" class="Section">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e17">The Trademark Act of 1946 provides for registration of trademarks, service marks, collective trademarks, and service marks, collective membership marks, and certification marks. 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1053, and 1054. The language of this Manual is generally directed to trademarks. Procedures for trademarks usually apply to other types of marks, unless otherwise stated. This chapter is devoted to special circumstances relating to service marks, collective marks, collective membership marks, and certification marks.
</p>
</div>
<div xmlns="" class="Section" id="TMEP-1300d1e10">
<h1 class="page-title">1301  Service Marks</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e18">Section 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1127, defines “service mark” as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-1d110e23">The term “service mark” means any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof--
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul >
<li class="nobull">(1) used by a person, or</li>
<li class="nobull">(2) which a person has a bona fide intention to use in commerce and applies to register on the principal register established by this [Act],
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e44">to identify and distinguish the services of one person, including a unique service, from the services of others and to indicate the source of the services, even if that source is unknown. Titles, character names, and other distinctive features of radio or television programs may be registered as service marks notwithstanding that they, or the programs, may advertise the goods of the sponsor.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-7d110e48">Therefore, to be registrable as a service mark, the asserted mark must function both to <i>identify</i> the services recited in the application <i>and distinguish</i>them from the services of others, and to <i>indicate the source</i> of the recited services, even if that source is unknown. The activities recited in the identification must constitute services as contemplated by the Trademark Act. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e30">TMEP §§1301.01</a>

<i>et seq</i>.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-8d110e54">If a proposed mark does not function as a service mark for the services recited, or if the applicant is not rendering a registrable service, the statutory basis for refusal of registration on the Principal Register is §§1, 2, 3, and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1052, 1053, and 1127.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-9d110e57">See <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e347">TMEP §1303</a>
 concerning collective service marks.
</p>
<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e30">1301.01  What Is a Service?</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e71">A service mark can only be registered for activities that constitute services as contemplated by the Trademark Act. 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1052, 1053, and 1127. The Trademark Act defines the term “service mark,” but it does not define what constitutes a service. Many activities are obviously services (e.g., dry cleaning, banking, shoe repairing, transportation, and house painting).
</p>
<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e36">1301.01(a)  Criteria for Determining What Constitutes a Service</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e82">The following criteria have evolved for determining what constitutes a service: (1) a service must be a real activity; (2) a service must be performed to the order of, or for the benefit of, someone other than the applicant; and (3) the activity performed must be qualitatively different from anything necessarily done in connection with the sale of the applicant’s goods or the performance of another service. 
<i>In re Canadian Pacific Ltd.</i>, 754 F.2d 992, 224 USPQ 971 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <i>In re Betz Paperchem</i>, Inc., 222 USPQ 89 (TTAB 1984); <i>In re Integrated Resources, Inc.</i>, 218 USPQ 829 (TTAB 1983); <i>In re Landmark Communications, Inc.</i>, 204 USPQ 692 (TTAB 1979).
</p>
<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e42">1301.01(a)(i)  Performance of a Real Activity</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e93">A service must be a real activity. A mere idea or concept, e.g., an idea for an accounting organizational format or a recipe for a baked item, is not a service. Similarly, a system, process, or method is not a service. 
<i>In re Universal Oil Products Co.</i>, 476 F.2d 653, 177 USPQ 456 (C.C.P.A. 1973); <i>In re Citibank, N.A.</i>, 225 USPQ 612 (TTAB 1985); <i>In re Scientific Methods, Inc.</i>, 201 USPQ 917 (TTAB 1979); <i>In re McCormick &amp; Co., Inc.</i>, 179 USPQ 317 (TTAB 1973). See <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e222">TMEP §1301.02(e)</a>
 regarding marks that identify a system or process.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e99">The commercial context must be considered in determining whether a real service is being performed. For example, at one time the activities of grocery stores, department stores, and similar retail stores were not considered to be services. However, it has long been recognized that gathering various products together, making a place available for purchasers to select goods, and providing any other necessary means for consummating purchases constitutes the performance of a service.
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e50">1301.01(a)(ii)  For the Benefit of Others</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e111">To be a service, an activity must be primarily for the benefit of someone other than the applicant. While an advertising agency provides a service when it promotes the goods or services of its clients, a company that promotes the sale of its own goods or services is doing so for its own benefit rather than rendering a service for others. 
<i>In re Reichhold Chemicals, Inc.</i>, 167 USPQ 376 (TTAB 1970). 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e92">TMEP §1301.01(b)(i)</a>. Similarly, a company that sets up a personnel department to employ workers for itself is merely facilitating the conduct of its own business, while a company whose business is to recruit and place workers for other companies is performing employment agency services.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e117">The controlling question is who <i>primarily</i> benefits from the activity for which registration is sought. If the activity is done primarily for the benefit of others, the fact that applicant derives an incidental benefit is not fatal. <i> In re Venture Lending Associates</i>, 226 USPQ 285 (TTAB 1985). On the other hand, if the activity primarily benefits applicant, it is not a registrable service even if others derive an incidental benefit. 
<i>In re Dr. Pepper Co.</i>, 836 F.2d 508, 5 USPQ2d 1207 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (contest promoting applicant’s goods not a service, even though benefits accrue to winners of contest); <i>City Nat’l Bank v. OPGI Mgmt. GP Inc./Gestion OPGI Inc.</i>, 106 USPQ2d 1668, 1676 (TTAB 2013) (finding that intranet website was used solely for internal purposes and that respondent was primary beneficiary); <i>In re Alaska Northwest Publishing Co.</i>, 212 USPQ 316, 317 (TTAB 1981) (stating that “[t]he that the activities and operations associated with the production, advertising or sale of the product may be indirectly beneficial to purchasers of the product is immaterial to the question of registrability of the mark as a service mark”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e120">Collecting information for the purpose of publishing one’s own periodical is not a service, because it is done primarily for the applicant’s benefit rather than for the benefit of others. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e125">TMEP §1301.01(b)(iii)</a>. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e127">Offering shares of one’s own stock for investment is not a service, because these are routine corporate activities that primarily benefit the applicant. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e133">TMEP §1301.01(b)(iv)</a>. On the other hand, offering a retirement income plan to applicant’s employees was found to be a service, because it primarily benefits the employees. 
<i>American Int’l Reinsurance Co., Inc. v. Airco, Inc.</i>, 570 F.2d 941, 197 USPQ 69 (C.C.P.A. 1978), <i>cert. denied</i> 439 U.S. 866, 200 USPQ 64 (1978).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-7d110e133">Licensing intangible property has been recognized as a separate service, analogous to leasing or renting tangible property, that primarily benefits the licensee. 
<i>In re Universal Press Syndicate</i>, 229 USPQ 638 (TTAB 1986).
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e64">1301.01(a)(iii)  Sufficiently Distinct from Activities Involved in Provision of Goods or Performance of Other Services</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e146">In determining whether an activity is sufficiently separate from an applicant’s principal activity to constitute a service, the examining attorney should first ascertain the nature of the applicant’s principal activity under the mark in question (i.e., the performance of a service or the provision of a tangible product). The examining attorney must then determine whether the activity identified in the application is in any material way a different kind of economic activity than what any provider of that particular product or service normally provides. In
<i> re Landmark Communications, Inc.</i>, 204 USPQ 692, 695 (TTAB 1979). 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e149">For example, operating a grocery store is clearly a service. Bagging groceries for customers is not considered a separately registrable service, because this activity is normally provided to and expected by grocery store customers, and is, therefore, merely ancillary to the primary service.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e152">Providing general information or instructions as to the purpose and uses of applicant’s goods is merely incidental to the sale of goods, not a separate consulting service. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e141">TMEP §1301.01(b)(v)</a>. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e159">Conducting a contest to promote the sale of one’s own goods or services is usually not considered a service, because it is an ordinary and routine promotional activity. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e92">TMEP §1301.01(b)(i)</a>. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-7d110e165">While the repair of the goods of others is a recognized service, an applicant’s guarantee of repair of its own goods normally does not constitute a separate service, because that activity is ancillary to and normally expected in the trade. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e106">TMEP §1301.01(b)(ii)</a>. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-8d110e171">However, the fact that an activity is ancillary to a principal service or to the sale of goods does not in itself mean that it is not a separately registrable service. The statute makes no distinction between primary, incidental, or ancillary services. 
<i>In re Universal Press Syndicate</i>, 229 USPQ 638 (TTAB 1986) (licensing cartoon character found to be a separate service that was not merely incidental or necessary to larger business of magazine and newspaper cartoon strip); <i>In re Betz Paperchem, Inc.</i>, 222 USPQ 89 (TTAB 1984) (chemical manufacturer’s feed, delivery, and storage of liquid chemical products held to constitute separate service, because applicant’s activities extend beyond routine sale of chemicals); <i>In re Congoleum Corp.</i>, 222 USPQ 452 (TTAB 1984) (awarding prizes to retailers for purchasing applicant’s goods from distributors held to be sufficiently separate from the sale of goods to constitute a service rendered to distributors, because it confers a benefit on distributors that is not normally expected by distributors in the relevant industry); <i>In re C.I.T. Financial Corp.</i>, 201 USPQ 124 (TTAB 1978) (computerized financial data-processing services rendered to applicant’s loan customers held to be a registrable service, since it provides benefits that were not previously available, and is separate and distinct from the primary service of making consumer loans); <i>In re U.S. Home Corp. of Texas</i>, 199 USPQ 698 (TTAB 1978) (planning and laying out residential communities for others was found to be a service, because it goes above and beyond what the average individual would do in constructing and selling a home on a piece of land that he or she has purchased); <i>In re John Breuner Co.</i>, 136 USPQ 94 (TTAB 1963) (credit services provided by a retail store constitute a separate service, since extension of credit is neither mandatory nor required in the operation of a retail establishment).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-9d110e174">The fact that the activities are offered only to purchasers of the applicant’s primary product or service does not necessarily mean that the activity is not a service. 
<i>In re Otis Engineering Corp.</i>, 217 USPQ 278 (TTAB 1982) (quality control and quality assurance services held to constitute a registrable service even though the services were limited to applicant’s own equipment); <i>In re John Breuner Co.</i>, <i>supra</i> (credit services offered only to customers of applicant’s retail store found to be a service).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-10d110e177">The fact that the services for which registration is sought are offered to a different class of purchasers than the purchasers of applicant’s primary product or service is also a factor to be considered. 
<i>In re Forbes Inc.</i>, 31 USPQ2d 1315 (TTAB 1994); <i>In re Home Builders Ass’n of Greenville</i>, 18 USPQ2d 1313 (TTAB 1990).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-11d110e180">Another factor to be considered in determining whether an activity is a registrable service is the use of a mark different from the mark used on or in connection with the applicant’s principal product or service. 
<i>See</i>
<i>In re Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc.</i>, 11 USPQ2d 1312 (TTAB 1989); <i>In re Universal Press Syndicate, supra; In re Congoleum Corp., supra; In re C.I.T. Financial Corp., supra.</i> However, an activity that is normally expected or routinely done in connection with sale of a product or another service is not a registrable service even if it is identified by a different mark. 
<i>In re Dr. Pepper Co.</i>, 836 F.2d 508, 5 USPQ2d 1207 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <i>In re Television Digest, Inc.</i>, 169 USPQ 505 (TTAB 1971). Moreover, the mark identifying the ancillary service does not have to be different from the mark identifying the applicant’s goods or primary service. 
<i>Ex parte Handmacher-Vogel, Inc.</i>, 98 USPQ 413 (Comm’r Pats. 1953).

<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e92">1301.01(b)(i)  Contests and Promotional Activities</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e201">It is well settled that the promotion of one’s own goods is not a service. 
<i>In re Radio Corp. of America</i>, 205 F.2d 180, 98 USPQ 157 (C.C.P.A. 1953) (record manufacturer who prepares radio programs primarily designed to advertise and sell records is not rendering a service); <i>In re SCM Corp.</i>, 209 USPQ 278 (TTAB 1980) (supplying merchandising aids and store displays to retailers does not constitute separate service); <i>Ex parte Wembley, Inc.</i>, 111 USPQ 386 (Comm’r Pats. 1956) (national advertising program designed to sell manufacturer’s goods to ultimate purchasers is not service to wholesalers and retailers, because national product advertising is normally expected of manufacturers of nationally distributed products, and is done in furtherance of the sale of the advertised products).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e204">However, an activity that goes above and beyond what is normally expected of a manufacturer in the relevant industry may be a registrable service, even if it also serves to promote the applicant’s primary product or service. 
<i>In re U.S. Tobacco Co.</i>, 1 USPQ2d 1502 (TTAB 1986) (tobacco company’s participating in auto race held to constitute an entertainment service, because participating in an auto race is not an activity that a seller of tobacco normally does);
<i> In re Heavenly Creations, Inc.</i>, 168 USPQ 317 (TTAB 1971) (applicant’s free hairstyling instructional parties found to be a service separate from the applicant’s sale of wigs, because it goes beyond what a seller of wigs would normally do in promoting its goods); <i>Ex parte Handmacher-Vogel, Inc.</i>, 98 USPQ 413 (Comm’r Pats. 1953) (clothing manufacturer’s conducting women’s golf tournaments held to be a service, because it is not an activity normally expected in promoting the sale of women’s clothing).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e207">Conducting a contest to promote the sale of one’s own goods is usually not considered a service, even though benefits may accrue to the winners of the contest. Such a contest is usually ancillary to the sale of goods or services, and is nothing more than a device to advertise the applicant’s products or services. 
<i>In re Dr. Pepper Co.</i>, 836 F.2d 508, 5 USPQ2d 1207 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <i>In re Loew’s Theatres, Inc.</i>, 179 USPQ 126 (TTAB 1973); <i>In re Johnson Publishing Co., Inc.</i>, 130 USPQ 185 (TTAB 1961). However, a contest that serves to promote the sale of the applicant’s goods may be registrable if it operates in a way that confers a benefit unrelated to the sale of the goods, and the benefit is not one that is normally expected of a manufacturer in that field.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e232">While the repair of the goods of others is a recognized service, an applicant’s guarantee of repair of its own goods does not normally constitute a separate service, because that activity is ancillary to and normally expected in the trade. 
<i>In re Orion Research Inc.</i>, 669 F.2d 689, 205 USPQ 688 (C.C.P.A. 1980) (guarantee of repair or replacement of applicant’s goods that is not separately offered, promoted, or charged for is not a service); <i>In re Lenox, Inc.</i>, 228 USPQ 966 (TTAB 1986) (lifetime warranty that is not separately offered, promoted, or charged for is not a service).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e235">However, a warranty that is offered or charged for separately from the goods, or is sufficiently above and beyond what is normally expected in the industry, may constitute a service. 
<i>In re Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, Inc.</i>, 11 USPQ2d 1312 (TTAB 1989) (comprehensive automobile vehicle preparation, sales, and service program held to be a service, where applicant’s package included features that were unique and would not normally be expected in the industry); <i>In re Sun Valley Waterbeds Inc.</i>, 7 USPQ2d 1825 (TTAB 1988) (retailer’s extended warranty for goods manufactured by others held to be a service, where the warranty is considerably more extensive than that offered by others); <i>In re Otis Engineering Corp.</i>, 217 USPQ 278 (TTAB 1982) (non-mandatory quality control and quality assurance services held to constitute a registrable service even though the services were limited to applicant’s own equipment, where the services were separately charged for, the goods were offered for sale without services, and the services were not merely a time limited manufacturer’s guarantee).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e238">Providing warranties to consumers and retailers on power-operated outdoor products was held to be a registrable service where the warranty covered goods manufactured by applicant but sold under the marks of third-party retailers. Noting that none of applicant’s trademarks appeared on the goods or identified applicant as the source of the goods, the Board found that the third-party retailers rather than applicant would be regarded as the manufacturer of the products. Because purchasers would make a distinction between the provider of the warranty and the provider of the goods, applicant’s warranty service would not be regarded as merely an inducement to purchase its own goods. The Board also noted that applicant’s activities constitute a service to the third-party retailers, because applicant’s provision of warranties avoids the need of the retailer itself to provide a warranty. 
<i>In re Husqvarna Aktiebolag</i>, 91 USPQ2d 1436 (TTAB 2009).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e242">When an applicant offers a warranty on its own goods or services, the identification of services must include the word “extended,” or similar wording, to indicate that the warranty is “qualitatively different” from a warranty normally provided ancillary to the sale of the applicant’s goods/services. When an applicant offers a warranty on third-party goods, the identification of services must so indicate. 
<i>See</i>
<i>In re Omega SA,</i>494 F.3d 1362, 83 USPQ2d 1541 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (affirming that the USPTO has the discretion to determine whether and how a trademark registration should include a more particularized identification of the goods for which a mark is used).

<i>In re Billfish Int’l Corp.</i>, 229 USPQ 152 (TTAB 1986) (activities of collecting, distributing, and soliciting information relating to billfishing tournaments for a periodical publication not a separate service, because these are necessary preliminary activities that a publisher must perform prior to publication and sale of publication); <i>In re Alaska Northwest Publishing Co.</i>, 212 USPQ 316 (TTAB 1981) (title of magazine section not registrable for magazine publishing services, because the activities and operations associated with designing, producing, and promoting applicant’s own product are ancillary activities that would be expected by purchasers and readers of any magazine); <i>In re Landmark Communications, Inc.</i>, 204 USPQ 692 (TTAB 1979) (title of newspaper section not registrable as service mark for educational or entertainment service, because collected articles, stories, reports, comics, advertising, and illustrations are indispensable components of newspapers without which newspapers would not be sold); <i>In re Television Digest, Inc.</i>, 169 USPQ 505 (TTAB 1971) (calculating advertising rates for a trade publication not a registrable service, because this is an integral part of the production or operation of any publication).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e282">
<i>In Canadian Pacific</i>, 224 USPQ at 974, the court noted that since shareholders are owners of the corporation, an applicant who offers a reinvestment plan to its stockholders is essentially offering the plan to itself and not to a segment of the buying public.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e308">Not every word, combination of words, or other designation used in the performance or advertising of services is registrable as a service mark. To function as a service mark, the asserted mark must be used in a way that identifies and distinguishes the source of the services recited in the application. Even if it is clear that the applicant is rendering a service (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e30">TMEP §§1301.01</a>

<i>et seq</i>.), the record must show that the asserted mark actually identifies and distinguishes the source of the service recited in the application. 
<i>In re Advertising and Marketing Development Inc.</i>, 821 F.2d 614, 2 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (stationery specimen showed use of THE NOW GENERATION as a mark for applicant's advertising or promotional services as well as to identify a licensed advertising campaign, where the recited services were specified in a byline appearing immediately beneath the mark).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e314">The fact that the proposed mark appears in an advertisement or brochure in which the services are advertised does not in itself show use as a mark. The record must show that there is a direct association between the mark and the service. 
<i>See</i>
<i> In re Universal Oil Products Co.</i>, 476 F.2d 653, 177 USPQ 456 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (term that identifies only a process does not function as a service mark, even where services are advertised in the same specimen brochure in which the name of the process is used); <i>In re Duratech Industries Inc.</i>, 13 USPQ2d 2052 (TTAB 1989) (term used on bumper sticker with no reference to the services does not function as a mark); <i>Peopleware Systems, Inc. v. Peopleware, Inc.</i>, 226 USPQ 320 (TTAB 1985) (term PEOPLEWARE used within a byline on calling card specimen does not constitute service mark usage of that term, even if specimen elsewhere shows that applicant provides the recited services); <i>In re J.F.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e320">The question of whether a designation functions as a mark that identifies and distinguishes the recited services is determined by examining the specimen(s) and any other evidence in the record that shows how the designation is used. 
<i>In re Morganroth</i>, 208 USPQ 284 (TTAB 1980); <i>In re Republic of Austria Spanische Reitschule</i>, 197 USPQ 494 (TTAB 1977).

Factors that the examining attorney should consider in determining whether the asserted mark functions as a service mark include whether the wording claimed as a mark is physically separate from textual matter, whether a term is displayed in capital letters or enclosed in quotation marks, and the manner in which a term is used in relation to other material on the specimen.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e324">While a service mark does not have to be displayed in any particular size or degree of prominence, it must be used in a way that makes a commercial impression separate and apart from the other elements of the advertising matter or other material upon which it is used, such that the designation will be recognized by prospective purchasers as a source identifier. 
<i>In re C.R. Anthony Co.</i>, 3 USPQ2d 1894 (TTAB 1987); <i>In re Post Properties, Inc.</i>, 227 USPQ 334 (TTAB 1985). The proposed mark must not blend so well with other matter on specimen that it is difficult or impossible to discern what the mark is.

On the other hand, the fact that the proposed mark is prominently displayed does not in and of itself make it registrable, if it is not used in a manner that would be perceived by consumers as an indicator of source. 
<i>In re Wakefern Food Corp.</i>, 222 USPQ 76 (TTAB 1984). The important question is not how readily a mark will be noticed but whether, when noticed, it will be understood as identifying and indicating the origin of the services. <i> In re Singer Mfg.

Evidence of use might include menus or letterhead that show promotion of the building’s design, or configuration, as a mark.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e445">Generally, a photograph is a proper specimen of use for a three-dimensional mark. However, photographs of a building are not sufficient to show use of the building design as a mark for services performed in the building if they only show the building in which the services are performed. The specimen must show that the proposed mark is used in a way that would be perceived as a mark.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e471">The title of a continuing series of presentations (e.g., a television or movie “series,” a series of live performances, or a continuing radio program), may constitute a mark for either entertainment services or educational services. However, the title of a single creative work, that is, the title of one episode or event presented as one program, does not function as a service mark. <i>In re Posthuma</i>, 45 USPQ2d 2011 (TTAB 1998) (term that identifies title of a play not registrable as service mark for entertainment services). The record must show that the matter sought to be registered is more than the title of one presentation, performance, or recording. See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e2517">TMEP §§1202.08</a>

<i>et seq</i>. and cases cited therein for further information regarding the registrability of the title of a single creative work.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e477">Specimens that show use of a service mark in relation to television programs or a movie series may be in the nature of a photograph of the video or film frame when the mark is used in the program.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e480">Service marks in the nature of titles of entertainment programs may be owned by the producer of the show, by the broadcasting system or station, or by the author or creator of the show, depending upon the circumstances. Normally, an applicant’s statement that the applicant owns the mark is sufficient; the examining attorney should not inquire about ownership, unless information in the record clearly contradicts the applicant’s verified statement that it is the owner of the mark.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e492">A term that only identifies a process, style, method, system, or the like is not registrable as a service mark. A system or process is only a way of doing something, not a service. The name of a system or process does not become a service mark, unless it is also used to identify and distinguish the service. 
<i>In re Universal Oil Products Co.</i>, 476 F.2d 653, 177 USPQ 456 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (term not registrable as service mark where the specimen shows use of the term only as the name of a process, even though applicant is in the business of rendering services generally and the services are advertised in the same specimen brochure in which the name of the process is used); <i>In re HSB Solomon Assoc. LLC</i>, 102 USPQ2d 1269, 1274 (TTAB 2012) (finding that the specimens show CEI identifying only a process and do not show a direct association between CEI and the applied-for services); <i>In re Hughes Aircraft Co.</i>, 222 USPQ 263 (TTAB 1984) (term does not function as service mark where it only identifies a photochemical process used in rendering service); <i>In re Vsesoyuzny Ordena Trudovogo Krasnogo Znameni Nauchoissledovatelsky Gorno-Metallurgichesky Institut Tsvetnykh Mettalov “Vnitsvetmet”</i>, 219 USPQ 69 (TTAB 1983) (KIVCET identifies only a process and plant configuration, not engineering services); <i>In re Scientific Methods, Inc.</i>, 201 USPQ 917 (TTAB 1979) (term that merely identifies educational technique does not function as mark to identify educational services); <i>In re J.F. Pritchard &amp; Co. and Kobe Steel, Ltd.</i>, 201 USPQ 951 (TTAB 1979) (term used only to identify liquefaction process does not function as mark to identify design and engineering services); <i>In re Produits Chimiques Ugine Kuhlmann Societe Anonyme</i>, 190 USPQ 305 (TTAB 1976) (term that merely identifies a process used in rendering the service does not function as service mark); <i>In re Lurgi Gesellschaft Fur Mineraloltechnik m.b.H</i>., 175 USPQ 736 (TTAB 1972) (term that merely identifies process for recovery of high-purity aromatics from hydrocarbon mixtures does not function as service mark for consulting, designing, and construction services); <i>Ex parte Phillips Petroleum Co.</i>, 100 USPQ 25 (Comm’r Pats. 1953) (although used in advertising of applicant’s engineering services, CYCLOVERSION was only used in the advertisements to identify a catalytic treating and conversion process).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e495">If the term is used to identify <i>both</i> the system or process <i>and</i> the services rendered by means of the system or process, the designation may be registrable as a service mark. 
<i>See</i>
<i>Liqwacon Corp. v. Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc.</i>, 203 USPQ 305 (TTAB 1979), in which the Board found that the mark LIQWACON identified both a waste treatment and disposal service and a chemical solidification process.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e498">The name of a system or process is registrable only if: (1) the applicant is performing a service (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e30">TMEP §§1301.01</a>

<i>et seq</i>.); and (2) the designation identifies and indicates the source of the service. In determining eligibility for registration, the examining attorney must carefully review the specimen, together with any other information in the record, to see how the applicant uses the proposed mark. The mere advertising of the recited services in a brochure that refers to the process does not establish that a designation functions as a service mark; there must be some association between the offer of services and the matter sought to be registered.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e543">In examining an application under 15 U.S.C. §1051(a), an amendment to allege use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(c), or a statement of use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(d), the examining attorney ordinarily should refuse registration if the record shows that the services advertised have not been rendered. For example, the use of a mark in the announcement of a future service does not constitute use as a service mark. 
<i>Aycock Eng'g, Inc. v. Airflite, Inc.</i>, 560 F.3d 1350, 90 USPQ2d 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (holding that actual use of the mark in commerce in connection with an existing service is required and that mere preparations to use a mark sometime in the future does not constitute use in commerce); <i>In re Port Auth. of N. Y.</i>, 3 USPQ2d 1453 (TTAB 1987) (finding advertising and promoting telecommunications services before the services were available insufficient to support registration); <i>In re Cedar Point, Inc.</i>, 220 USPQ 533 (TTAB 1983) (holding that advertising of a marine entertainment park, which was not yet open, was not a valid basis for registration); <i>In re Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co.</i>, 124 USPQ 465 (TTAB 1960) (holding that stickers placed on policies, bills, and letters announcing prospective name change is mere adoption, not service mark use).
</p>
<p id="ch1300_d1b20f_2269c_b1">Sometimes a service-mark specimen may show the wording “beta” being used in connection with the relevant services. This term is commonly used to describe a preliminary version of a product or service. Although some beta services may not be made available to consumers, others are. For example, a beta version of non-downloadable or downloadable software may be made available to the public for use even though the final version has not been released. Thus, the appearance of this term on a service-mark specimen does not, by itself, necessarily mean that the relevant services are not in actual use in commerce or that the specimen is unacceptable. However, if examination of the specimen indicates that the beta version is not in actual use in commerce, the examining attorney must refuse registration because applicant has not provided evidence of use of the applied-for mark in commerce. The statutory basis for refusal is 15 U.S.C. §§1051 and 1127. See TMEP §§

<h1 class="page-title">1302  Collective Marks Generally</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e718">Section 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1127, defines “collective mark” as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-1d110e723">The term “collective mark” means a trademark or service mark--
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul >
<li class="nobull">(1) used by the members of a cooperative, an association, or other collective group or organization, or
</li>
<li class="nobull">(2) which such cooperative, association, or other collective group or organization has a bona fide intention to use in commerce and applies to register on the principal register established by this [Act], and includes marks indicating membership in a union, an association or other organization.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e744">Under the Trademark Act, a collective mark must be <i>owned by</i> a collective entity even though the mark is <i>used by</i> the members of the collective. There are basically two types of collective marks: (1) collective trademarks or collective service marks; and (2) collective membership marks. The distinction between these types of collective marks is explained in <i>Aloe Creme Laboratories, Inc. v. American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery</i>, Inc., 192 USPQ 170, 173 (TTAB 1976), as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-1d110e750">A <i>collective trademark</i> or <i>collective service mark</i> is a mark adopted by a “collective” (i.e., an association, union, cooperative, fraternal organization, or other organized collective group) for use only by its members, who in turn use the mark to identify their goods or services and distinguish them from those of nonmembers. The “collective” itself neither sells goods nor performs services under a collective trademark or collective service mark, but the collective may advertise or otherwise promote the goods or services sold or rendered by its members under the mark. A <i>collective membership mark</i> is a mark adopted for the purpose of indicating membership in an organized collective group, such as a union, an association, or other organization. Neither the collective nor its members uses the collective membership mark to identify and distinguish goods or services; rather, the sole function of such a mark is to indicate that the person displaying the mark is a member of the organized collective group.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e773">Section 4 of the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. §1054, provides for registration of both collective marks and certification marks, without distinguishing between them, but §45 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1127, defines collective marks and certification marks separately, as distinctly different types of marks. (See <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e585">TMEP §§1306</a>

<i>et seq</i>. regarding certification marks.)
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e779">A brief history will serve to put these sections in perspective. The earlier statutory provision, out of which §4 and the accompanying definitions in §45 grew, was the June 10, 1938 amendment of the Trademark Act of 1905. Under the Act of 1905, registration could be based only on a person’s own use of a mark. The purpose of the 1938 amendment was to provide for registration of a mark by an owner who “exercises legitimate control over the use of a collective mark.” “Collective marks,” however, were not defined under the Act of 1905, as amended. Section 45 of the Act of 1946 defined the separate types of marks.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e798">Collective trademarks and collective service marks indicate commercial origin of goods or services, but as <i>collective</i> marks they indicate that the party providing the goods or services is a member of a certain group and meets its standards for admission. The mark is used by all members of the group; therefore, no one member can own the mark, and the collective organization holds the title to the collectively used mark for the benefit of all members of the group.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e801">The collective organization itself neither sells goods nor performs services under the mark, but may advertise to publicize the mark and promote the goods or services sold by its members under the mark. For example, an agricultural cooperative of produce sellers does not sell its own goods or render services, but promotes the goods and services of its members.
</p>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e819">Applications for registration of collective trademarks and collective service marks are different in form from applications for registration of other trademarks and service marks, because of the difference in ownership and use of collective marks.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e822">Under the definition of “collective mark” in §45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1127, a collective mark must be owned by a collective entity. The use of a collective trademark or collective service mark is by members of the collective. Therefore, in an application based on use in commerce under §1(a) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051(a), the applicant must assert that the applicant is exercising legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce by its members.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e825">In an application based on §1(b), §44, or §66(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051(b), 15 U.S.C. §1126, or 15 U.S.C. §1141f(a), the applicant must assert that the applicant has a bona fide intention, and is entitled, to exercise legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce by its members. In a §1(b) application, before the mark can register, the applicant must file an allegation of use (i.e., either an amendment to allege use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(c), or a statement of use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(d)), alleging that the applicant is exercising legitimate control over the use of the mark in commerce by its members.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e829">In certain situations, notwithstanding the use of a collective trademark or collective service mark by the members of the collective, the collective itself may also use the same mark as a trademark for the goods or services covered by the collective trademark or service mark registration. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e575">TMEP §1305</a>. The “anti-use-by-owner rule” of §4 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1054, does not apply to collective marks.

The manner of use required is similar to trademark or service mark use. For example, collective trademark specimens should show the mark used on the goods or packaging for the goods; collective service mark specimens should show the mark used in advertising for the services or in the rendering of the services.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e888">The purpose of the mark must be to indicate that the product or service is provided by a member of a collective group. However, the specimen itself does not have to state that purpose explicitly. The examining attorney should accept the specimen if the mark is used on the specimen to indicate the source of the product or service, and there is no information in the record that is inconsistent with the applicant's averments that the mark is a collective mark owned by a collective group and used by members of the group.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e964">The Trademark Act of 1905 prohibited registration by anyone of symbols of collective groups. The Act of 1946, however, contains no prohibition and thus permits registration by the owners of collective marks, including those used to indicate membership.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e967">Membership marks are not trademarks or service marks in the ordinary sense; they are not used in business or trade, and they do not indicate commercial origin of goods or services. Registration of these marks fills the need of collective organizations who do not use the symbols of their organizations on goods or services but who wish to protect their marks to prevent their use by others.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1133">Likelihood of confusion may arise from the contemporaneous use of a collective membership mark on the one hand and a trademark or service mark on the other. The same standards used to determine likelihood of confusion between trademarks and service marks also apply to collective membership marks. 
<i>See</i>15 U.S.C. §1052(d); <i>In re National Novice Hockey League, Inc.</i>, 222 USPQ 638 (TTAB 1984); <i>Allstate Life Ins. Co. v.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1136">The finding of likelihood of confusion between a collective membership mark and a trademark or service mark is not based on confusion as to the source of any goods or services which happen to be provided by the members of the collective organization.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1148">
<i>Section 1 and §44 Applications</i>. In applications under §§1 and 44 of the Trademark Act, collective membership marks are classified in Class 200. 37 C.F.R. §6.4. Class 200 was established as a result of the decision in <i>Ex parte Supreme Shrine of the Order of the White Shrine of Jerusalem</i>, 109 USPQ 248 (Comm’r Pats. 1956). Before this decision, there was no registration of membership insignia as such on the theory that all collective marks were either collective trademarks or collective service marks. Some marks that were actually membership marks were registered under the Act of 1946 as collective service marks, and a few were registered as collective trademarks. That practice was discontinued upon the clarification of the basis for registration of membership marks and the creation of Class 200.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1151">
<i>Section 66(a) Applications</i>. In a §66(a) application (i.e., a request for extension of protection of an international registration to the United States under the Madrid Protocol), classification is determined by the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (“IB”), in accordance with the <i>Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks</i>
<i>(“Nice Agreement”)</i>. Class 200 comes from the old United States classification system (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1400.html#TMEP-1400d1e20">TMEP §1401.02</a>) and is not included in the international classification system. In a §66(a) application, the international classification of goods/services cannot be changed from the classification given to the goods/services by the IB. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1400.html#TMEP-1400d1e1758">TMEP §1401.03(d)</a>. Accordingly, if the mark in a §66(a) application is identified as a collective membership mark, or appears to be a collective membership mark, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) 
<b id="">will not reclassify it into Class 200. However, the examining attorney must ensure that the applicant complies with all other United States requirements for collective membership marks, regardless of the classification chosen by the IB.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1169">An identification of goods or services is not appropriate in connection with a collective membership mark. The purpose of a collective membership mark is to indicate membership in an organization. Appropriate identification language would be, “indicating membership in an organization (association, club or the like) ...,” followed by a phrase indicating the nature of the organization or association, e.g., “indicating membership in an organization of computer professionals.”
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1172">The nature of an organization can be indicated by specifying the area of activity of its members (e.g., they may sell lumber, cosmetics, or food, or may deal in chemical products or household goods, or provide services as fashion designers, engineers, or accountants). If goods or services are not directly involved, the nature of an organization can be indicated by specifying the organization’s type or purpose (such as a service or social club, a political society, a trade association, a beneficial fraternal organization, or the like). Detailed descriptions of an organization’s objectives or activities are not necessary. It is sufficient if the identification indicates broadly either the field of activity as related to the goods or services, or the general type or purpose of the organization.

If the members are in business and place the mark on their business stationery to show their membership, pieces of such stationery are acceptable. Flags, pennants, and banners of various types used in connection with political parties, club groups, or the like could be satisfactory specimens.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e1197">Many associations, particularly fraternal societies, use jewelry such as pins, rings, or charms to indicate membership. 
<i>See</i>
<i>In re Triangle Club of Princeton University</i>, <i>supra</i>. However, not every ornamental design on jewelry is necessarily an indication of membership. The record must show that the design on a piece of jewelry is actually an indication of membership before the jewelry can be accepted as a specimen of use.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-7d110e1200">Shoulder, sleeve, pocket, or similar patches, whose design constitutes a membership mark and which are authorized by the parent organization for use by members on garments to indicate membership, are normally acceptable as specimens. Clothing authorized by the parent organization to be worn by members may also be an acceptable specimen.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-8d110e1203">A specimen that shows use of the mark by the collective organization itself, rather than by a member, is not acceptable. Collective organizations often publish various kinds of printed material, such as catalogs, directories, bulletins, newsletters, magazines, programs, and the like. Placement of the mark on these items by the collective organization represents use of the mark as a trademark or service mark to indicate that the collective organization is the source of the material. The mark is not placed on these items by the parent organization to indicate membership of a person in the organization.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-8d110e1343">There are generally three types of certification marks. First, there are certification marks that certify that goods or services originate in a specific geographic region (e.g., ROQUEFORT for cheese).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1376">A certification mark may not be used, in the trademark sense of “used,” by the owner of the mark; it may be used only by a person or persons other than the owner of the mark. That is, the owner of a certification mark does not apply the mark to his or her goods or services and, in fact, usually does not attach or apply the mark at all. The mark is generally applied by other persons to their goods or services, with authorization from the owner of the mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1379">The owner of a certification mark does not produce the goods or perform the services in connection with which the mark is used, and thus does not control their nature and quality. Therefore, it is not appropriate to inquire about control over the nature and quality of the goods or services. What the owner of the certification mark does control is use of the mark by others on their goods or services. This control consists of taking steps to ensure that the mark is applied only to goods or services that contain the characteristics or meet the requirements that the certifier/owner has established or adopted for the certification. See <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e812">TMEP §1306.06(f)(ii)</a>

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e624">1306.01(b)  Purpose Is to Certify, Not to Indicate Source</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1394">The purpose of a certification mark is to inform purchasers that the goods or services of a person possess certain characteristics or meet certain qualifications or standards established by another person. A certification mark does not indicate origin in a single commercial or proprietary source. In certifying, the same mark is used on the goods or services of many different producers.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1397">The message conveyed by a certification mark is that the goods or services have been examined, tested, inspected, or in some way checked by a person who is not their producer, using methods determined by the certifier/owner. The placing of the mark on goods, or its use in connection with services, thus constitutes a certification by someone other than the producer that the prescribed characteristics or qualifications of the certifier for those goods or services have been met.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1410">A geographical term may be used, either alone or as a portion of a composite mark, to certify that the goods originate in the geographical region identified by the term or, in some circumstances, from a broader region that includes the region identified by the term. <i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e648">TMEP §1306.02(a)</a>. As noted in <i>Community of Roquefort v. William Faehndrich, Inc.</i>, 303 F.2d 494, 497, 133 USPQ 633, 635 (2d Cir. 1962):
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-1d110e1415">A geographical name does not require a secondary meaning in order to qualify for registration as a certification mark. It is true that section 1054 provides that certification marks are “subject to the provisions relating to the registration of trademarks, so far as they are applicable....” But section 1052(e)(2), which prohibits registration of names primarily geographically descriptive, specifically excepts “indications of regional origin” registrable under section 1054. Therefore, a geographical name may be registered as a certification mark even though it is primarily geographically descriptive.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e1419">When a geographical term is used in a composite certification mark to certify regional origin, the examining attorney should not require a disclaimer or refuse registration of the composite mark on the ground that the mark is primarily geographically descriptive. However, when a geographical term used in a composite certification mark is not used to certify regional origin (e.g., “California” used to certify that fruit is organically grown), the examining attorney should refuse registration or require a disclaimer, as appropriate.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e1423">Marks that may be used to certify regional origin are not necessarily limited to terms that comprise precise geographical terminology. A distortion of a geographical term, an abbreviation of a geographical term, or a combination of geographical terms can be used as, or in, a certification mark indicating regional origin. It is also possible for a term that is not technically geographical to have significance as an indication of origin solely in a particular region.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-7d110e1426">The issue in determining whether a designation is registrable as a regional certification mark is whether the public understands that goods bearing the mark come only from the region named in the mark, not whether the public is expressly aware of the certification function of the mark per se. If use of the designation in fact is controlled by the certifier and limited to products meeting the certifier’s standards of regional origin, and if purchasers understand the designation to refer only to products produced in the particular region and not to products produced elsewhere, then the designation functions as a regional certification mark.

If the record or other evidence available to the examining attorney indicates that the proposed mark has a principal significance as a generic term denoting a type of goods, registration should be refused.  <i>In re Cooperativa Produttori Latte E Fontina Valle D'Acosta</i>, 230 USPQ 131 (TTAB 1986) (FONTINA held a generic name of a type of cheese rather than a certification mark indicating regional origin, in view of the fact that non-certified producers outside that region use the term to identify non-certified cheeses). However, a certification mark used to certify regional origin will be deemed to have become a generic term as applied to particular goods only if it has lost its significance as an indication of regional origin of those goods.

<i>Tea Board of India v. The Republic of Tea, Inc.</i>, 80 USPQ2d 1881 (TTAB 2006) (applicant failed to establish that the term DARJEELING had become generic due to opposer’s alleged failure to control the use of the mark to certify origin in the Darjeeling region of India), and cases cited therein.

If there is evidence that the narrower geographic area named in the mark is famous for the goods or they are a principal product of that place, and by virtue of the broader region identified in the certification statement the goods may not originate in the geographic location named in the mark, the examining attorney must refuse registration of the mark as geographically deceptive under §2(e)(3) of the Trademark Act. <i>See</i> §§1210.05-1210.05(e).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1461">When a certification mark consists solely, or essentially, of a geographical term, the examining attorney should inquire as to the authority of the applicant to control the use of the term, if the authority is not obvious. Normally, the entity that has authority to exercise control over the use of a geographical term as a certification mark is a governmental body or a body operating with governmental authorization. The right that a private person can acquire in a geographical term is usually a trademark right, on the basis of exclusive use resulting in the term becoming distinctive of that person’s goods. When, however, circumstances make it desirable or necessary for many or all persons in a region to use the name of the region to indicate the origin of their goods, there would be no opportunity for the name to become distinctive for only one person. The term would be used by all persons in the region, not as a trademark indicating commercial origin, but as a certification mark indicating regional origin.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1464">When a geographical term is used as a certification mark, two elements are of basic concern: first, preserving the freedom of all persons in the region to use the term and; second, preventing abuses or illegal uses of the mark that would be detrimental to all those entitled to use the mark. Normally, a private individual is not in the best position to fulfill these objectives. The government of a region would be the logical authority to control the use of the name of the region. The government, either directly or through a body to which it has given authority, would have power to preserve the right of all persons entitled to use the mark and to prevent abuse or illegal use of the mark.

There may be an interrelationship between bodies in more than one of these categories and the decision as to which is the appropriate body to apply depends on which body actually conducts the certification program or is most directly associated with it.

The certifier does not certify the quality of the work being performed, but only that the work was performed by a member of the union or group, or by someone who meets certain standards.

<i>See also</i>
<i>American Speech-Language-Hearing Ass’n v. National Hearing Aid Society</i>, 224 USPQ 798 (TTAB 1984). Used in this manner, the mark certifies a characteristic of the goods or services. Whether or not specific matter functions as a certification mark depends on whether the matter is used in connection with the goods or services in such a manner that the purchasing public will recognize it, either consciously or otherwise, as a certification mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1492">Occasionally, it is not clear whether a term is being used to certify that work or labor relating to the goods or services was performed by someone meeting certain standards or by members of a union or other organization to indicate membership, or whether the term is merely being used as a title or a degree of the performer to indicate professional qualifications. Matter that might appear to be simply a title or a degree may function as a certification mark if used in the proper manner.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1511">The owner of a certification mark is the party responsible for the certification that is conveyed by the mark. The party who affixes the mark, with authorization of the certifier, does not own the mark; nor is the mark owned by someone who merely acts as an agent for the certifier, for example, an inspector hired by the certifier. The certifier, as owner, is the only person who may file an application for registration of a certification mark. 
<i>See</i>
<i>In re Safe Electrical Cord Committee</i>, 125 USPQ 310 (TTAB 1960).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1514">Certification is often the sole activity for the owner of a certification mark. However, a person is not necessarily precluded from owning a certification mark because he or she also engages in other activities, including the sale of goods or the performance of services. However, the certification mark may not be the same mark that the person uses as a trademark or service mark on goods or services. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e708">TMEP §1306.05(a)</a>. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-1d110e1522">Examples of organizations which conduct both types of activities are trade associations and other membership or “club” types of businesses, such as automobile associations. These organizations may perform services for their members, and sell various goods to their members and others, as well as conduct programs in which they certify characteristics or other aspects of goods or services, especially of kinds which relate to the main purpose of the association.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e1527">Manufacturing or service companies that do not certify the goods or services of members may nonetheless engage in certification programs under proper circumstances. For example, a manufacturer of chemical wood preservatives might conduct a program certifying certain characteristics of wood or wood products that are treated and sold by others. Among the characteristics or circumstances certified could be the fact that a preservative produced by this manufacturer under a specified trademark was used in the treatment.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-7d110e1530">As another example, a magazine publisher may conduct a certification program relating to goods or services that are advertised in or have some relevance to the interest area of the magazine.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-8d110e1533">The certifier/owner determines the requirements for the certification. The standards do not have to be original with the certifier/owner, but may be standards established by another person, such as specifications promulgated by a government agency, or standards developed through research of a private research organization. See <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e812">TMEP §1306.06(f)(ii)</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1554">The Trademark Act does not require that a certification mark be in any specific form or include any specific wording. A certification mark can be wording only, design only, or a combination of wording and design. In other words, there is no particular way that a mark must look in order to be a certification mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1557">A certification mark often includes wording such as “approved by,” “inspected,” “conforming to,” “certified,” or similar wording, which is natural since certification (or approval) is practically the only significance the mark is to have when it is used on goods or in connection with services. However, this wording is not required, and a mark that entirely lacks this wording can perform the function of certification.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e1560">The examining attorney must look to the facts disclosed in the record to determine whether the mark is used in certification activity and is in fact a certification mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e1564">It is not necessary to show that the mark is instantly recognizable as a certification mark, or that the mark has already become well known to the public as a certification mark. However, it should be clear from the record that the circumstances surrounding the use or promotion of the mark will give certification significance to the mark in the marketplace. <i> See Ex parte Van Winkle</i>, 117 USPQ 450 (Comm’r Pats. 1958).

<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e708">1306.05(a)  Same Mark Not Registrable as Certification Mark and as Any Other Type of Mark</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1575">Trademarks or service marks and certification marks are different and distinct types of marks, which serve different purposes. A trademark or service mark is used by the owner of the mark on his or her goods or services, whereas a certification mark is used by persons other than the owner of the mark. A certification mark does not distinguish between producers, but represents a certification regarding some characteristic that is common to the goods or services of many persons. Using the same mark for two contradictory purposes would result in confusion and uncertainty about the meaning of the mark and would invalidate the mark for either purpose.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1578">Section 4 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1054, prohibits the registration of a certification mark “when used so as to represent falsely that the owner or a user thereof makes or sells the goods or performs the services on or in connection with which such mark is used;” and §14(5)(B) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1064(5)(B), provides for the cancellation of a registered certification mark where the registrant engages in the production or marketing of any goods or services to which the certification mark is applied. <i> See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e850">TMEP §1306.07</a>
 regarding §14(5) of the Act. Thus, if a party owns a registration as a trademark or service mark for any goods or services, he or she may not register the same mark as a certification mark for those goods or services. Conversely, a registration as a certification mark precludes registration of the same mark by its owner as a trademark or service mark for any goods or services to which the certification mark applies. The owner of a certification mark may seek registration of the same mark as a trademark or service mark for goods or services other than those to which the certification mark is applied. However, the application for a certification mark must be filed separately from the application for a trademark or service mark, because the purpose and use of a trademark or service mark differ from those of a certification mark as do the allegations and claims made in support of a certification mark. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e1584">The prohibition against registration both as a trademark or service mark and as a certification mark applies to marks that are identical or so similar as to constitute essentially the same mark. Variations in wording or design, even though small, can, if meaningful, create different marks. On the other hand, inconsequential differences, such as the style of lettering or the addition of wording of little importance, normally would not prevent marks from being regarded as the same. 
<i>See </i>
<i>In re 88Open Consortium Ltd.</i>, 28 USPQ2d 1314 (TTAB 1993), in which the mark 88OPEN COMPATIBILITY CERTIFIED and design was found registrable as a certification mark even though applicant owned six registrations for the marks 88OPEN in typed and stylized form as trademarks, service marks, and collective membership marks. The Board noted that the words COMPATIBILITY CERTIFIED served to inform those seeing the mark that it is functioning as a certification mark, and that the certification mark included a design feature not found in the previously registered marks.

The change might also be the other way around, from trademark or service mark use to certification mark use.

<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1400.html#TMEP-1400d1e1758">TMEP §1401.03(d)</a>. Accordingly, if the mark in a §66(a) application is identified as a certification mark, or appears to be a certification mark, the USPTO will not reclassify it into Class A or B. However, the examining attorney must ensure that the applicant complies with all other United States requirements for certification marks, regardless of the classification chosen by the IB.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e784">1306.06(e)  Identification of Goods and Services in Certification Mark Applications</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1749">The identification of goods or services in a certification mark application must describe the goods and/or services of the party who will receive the certification, not the activities of the certifier/owner of the certification mark. This is consistent with the requirement that the owner of a certification mark not produce the goods or perform the services in connection with which the mark is used. The certification activities of the certifier are described in the certification statement, not in the identification of goods/services. For an explanation of the certification statement, <i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e798">TMEP §1306.06(f)(i)</a>. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1755">In a certification mark application, the goods or services that are certified may be identified less specifically than in an application for registration of a trademark or service mark. Ordinarily, it is only necessary to indicate general kinds of goods and services, such as food, agricultural commodities, electrical products, textile materials, printed material, insurance agency services, machinery repair, or restaurant services. However, sufficient information must be provided to enable a comparison of goods/services and analysis of trade channels in regard to possible likelihood-of-confusion scenarios. If the certification program itself is limited to specific goods or services, for example, wine, wood doors, or bakery machinery, then the identification in the application must also reflect this limitation.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e1758">The terms “certification,” “certify,” or “certifies” should not be included in the identification, which should be limited to the goods or services, as in the following examples:
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="ch1300_d1fd0d_1939d_35f">Building, construction, and safety materials and products, in International Class A

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e798">1306.06(f)(i)  Statement of What the Mark Certifies</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1779">The application must contain a statement of the characteristic, standard, or other feature that is certified or intended to be certified by the mark. The statement should begin with wording, “The certification mark, as used (or intended to be used) by authorized persons, certifies (or is intended to certify) . . . .” 
<i>See</i>37 C.F.R. §2.45.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1782">All of the characteristics or features that the mark certifies should be included. A mark does not have to be limited to certifying a single characteristic or feature.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e1785">The characteristics or features that the mark certifies should be explained in reasonable detail, so that they are clear. The broad suggestive terms of the statute, such as quality, material, mode of manufacture, are generally not satisfactory by themselves, because they do not accurately reveal the nature of the certification. How specific the statement should be depends in part on the narrowness or breadth of the certification. For example, “quality” would not inform the public of the meaning of the certification where the characteristic being certified is limited, for example, to the strength of a material, or the purity of a strain of seed.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e1789">The statement of certification in the application is printed on the registration certificate. For that reason, it should be reasonably specific but does not have to include the details of the specifications of the characteristic being certified. If practicable, however, more detailed specifications should be made part of the application file record.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-7d110e1792">The statement of what the mark certifies is separate from the identification of goods and/or services.
</p>

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e812">1306.06(f)(ii)  Standards</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1804">The applicant (certifier) must submit a copy of the standards established to determine whether others may use the certification mark on their goods and/or in connection with their services. 37 C.F.R. §2.45. For an intent-to-use application, under §1(b) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051(b), the standards are submitted with the allegation of use (i.e., either the amendment to allege use or the statement of use). 37 C.F.R. §2.45(b).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1807">The standards do not have to be original with the applicant. They may be standards established by another party, such as specifications promulgated by a government agency, or standards developed through research of a private research organization.
</p>
<p id="ch1300_d1b20f_22cd8_191">The standards must cover the full scope of the goods/services identified in the application. For example, if the goods are “olive oil,” but the standards are only for “extra virgin olive oil,” the examining attorney must require the applicant to submit standards that cover all types of olive oil or to amend the identification to “extra virgin olive oil.”

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e820">1306.06(f)(iii)  Exercise of Control</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1819">In an application based on use in commerce under §1(a) of the Trademark Act, the applicant must assert that the applicant is exercising legitimate control over the use of the certification mark in commerce. 37 C.F.R. §2.45(a).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1822">In an application based on §1(b), §44, or §66(a) of the Act, the applicant must assert that the applicant has a bona fide intention, and is entitled, to exercise legitimate control over the use of the certification mark in commerce. 
<i>See </i>37 C.F.R. §2.45(b). In a §1(b) application, before the mark can register, the applicant must file an allegation of use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(c) or 15 U.S.C. §1051(d), alleging that the applicant is exercising legitimate control over the use of the certification mark in commerce.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e1825">If there is doubt as to the existence or nature of such control by the applicant, the examining attorney should require an explanation and sufficient disclosure of facts, or the filing of appropriate documents, to support the applicant’s statement regarding the exercise of control over the use of the mark, pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b).

<i>See</i>37 C.F.R. §2.45. This statement does not have to be verified, and can, therefore, be entered by examiner’s amendment.

It is preferred that the applicant completely rewrite the application to provide a clean copy, rather than amend the original documents. Also, the application should be re-executed because some essential allegations differ for the different types of marks.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1865">Applications for certification marks, collective marks, and collective membership marks cannot be filed using TEAS Plus. 37 C.F.R. §2.22(c).

</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-1d110e1908">
<i>Subsection A:</i> In an application, the applicant states under oath or declaration that the applicant is exercising, or has a bona fide intention to exercise, legitimate control over the use of the certification mark. 

<a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e820">TMEP §1306.06(f)(iii)</a>. Such statement is accepted, unless the examining attorney has knowledge of facts indicating that it should not be accepted.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-11d110e1921">
<i>Subsection C:</i> This subsection concerns whether a party permits use of the certification mark for purposes other than to certify. No statements are required in the application specifically on this point. The existence of unauthorized or illegal uses by others without the applicant’s authorization is not within the examining attorney’s province and cannot be used as a basis for refusal to register, provided that use authorized by the applicant, as supported by the record, is proper certification use.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e874">1306.08  Registration of Certification Mark on Basis of Foreign Registration</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1936">A certification mark may be registered in the United States under §44 of the Trademark Act, on the basis of a foreign registration. However, whether a particular foreign registration is acceptable as the basis for a United States registration depends on the scope of the foreign registration.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1939">A person may not obtain a registration in the United States that is broader in scope than the foreign registration on which the United States application is based. 
<i>See</i>
<i>In re Löwenbräu München</i>, 175 USPQ 178 (TTAB 1972); 

<a href="tmep-1400.html#TMEP-1400d1e2049">TMEP §1402.01(b)</a>. Therefore, a registration as a certification mark in the United States may not be based on a foreign registration that is actually a trademark registration, i.e., a registration that is based on the registrant’s placement of the mark on his or her own goods as a trademark. The scope of the registration, i.e., the nature of the registration right, would not be the same.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e1945">The scope and nature of the registration right is not always immediately apparent from a foreign registration certificate. Foreign registration certificates are not always labeled as pertaining to a trademark, service mark, collective mark, or certification mark and, when they are labeled, the significance of the term is not always clear. For example, the designation “collective” represents a different concept in some foreign countries than it does in the United States. Moreover, while a certificate printed on a standardized form may be headed with the designation “trademark,” the body of the certificate might contain language to the contrary.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e1949">Since certification is an exception in the larger world of trademarks, an indication of certification in the registration certificate would normally represent a conscious decision that a certification situation exists. Therefore, if a foreign registration certificate has a heading that designates the mark as a certification mark, or if the body of the foreign certificate contains language indicating that the registration is for certification, the foreign registration normally may be accepted to support registration in the United States as a certification mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-7d110e1952">Whenever there is ambiguity about the scope or nature of the foreign registration, or whenever the examining attorney believes that the foreign certificate may not reflect the actual registration right, the examining attorney should inquire regarding the basis of the foreign registration, pursuant to 37 C.F.R. 2.61(b).

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e888">1306.09  Uncertainty Regarding Type of Mark</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1964">When the facts in the application are insufficient to provide an adequate basis for determining whether the mark is functioning as a trademark or service mark or as a certification mark, the examining attorney should ask for further explanation as to the activities in which the mark is used and should require a sufficient disclosure of the facts to enable a proper examination to be made, pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b). The manner in which the activities associated with a mark are conducted is the main factor that determines the type of mark. The conduct of parties involved with the mark evidences the relationship between the parties, and the responsibilities of each to the goods or services and to the mark.
</p>
<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e894">1306.09(a)  Distinction Between Certification Mark and Collective Mark</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e1975">A collective trademark or collective service mark indicates origin of goods or services in the members of a group. A collective membership mark indicates membership in an organization. A certification mark certifies characteristics or features of goods or services. See <i>American Speech-Language-Hearing Ass’n v. National Hearing Aid Society</i>, 224 USPQ 798, 806-808 (TTAB 1984), for a discussion of the distinction between collective marks and certification marks.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e1978">Both collective marks and certification marks are used by more than one person, but only the users of collective marks are related to each other through membership in a collective group. The collective mark is used by all members and the collective organization holds the title to the collective mark for the benefit of all members.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e1981">A certification mark may be used to certify that the work or labor on the goods or services was performed by a member of a union or other organization. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e670">TMEP §1306.03</a>. Used in this manner, the certification mark certifies not that the user is a member of an organization but that the labor on the user’s goods or services was performed by a member of an organization.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-6d110e1988">An application to register a mark that is used or intended to be used by members of a collective group must be scrutinized carefully to determine the function of the mark. If the mark is used or intended to be used by the members as a trademark on goods they produce or as a service mark for services they perform, then the mark is a collective trademark or collective service mark. If the mark is used or intended to be used by members to indicate membership in an organization, then the mark is a collective membership mark. However, if use of the mark is or will be authorized only under circumstances designated by the organization to certify characteristics or features of the goods or services, the mark is a certification mark.

<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1300d1e906">1306.09(b)  Distinguishing Certification Mark Use from Related-Company Use of Trademark or Service Mark</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e2000">Sometimes, an application requests registration of a certification mark, but there is a contractual relationship in the nature of a franchise or license between the applicant and the user of the mark, whereby the applicant, as the franchisor or licensor, specifies the nature or quality of the goods produced (or of the services performed) under the contract. These situations require care in examination because they usually indicate trademark or service mark use (through related companies) rather than certification mark use, because the applicant, as franchisor or licensor, controls the nature of the goods or services and has the responsibility for their quality.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-4d110e2003">The key distinction between use of subject matter as a certification mark and use as a trademark or service mark through a related company is the purpose and function of the mark in the market place, and the significance that it would have to the relevant purchasing public. A trademark or service mark serves to indicate the origin of goods or services, whereas a certification mark serves to guarantee certain qualities or characteristics. 
<i>See</i>
<i>In re Monsanto Co.</i>, 201 USPQ 864, 870 (TTAB 1978); <i>In re Celanese Corp. of America</i>, 136 USPQ 86 (TTAB 1962).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-5d110e2006">Furthermore, the owner of a certification mark must permit use of the mark if the goods or services meet the certifier’s standard, whereas a trademark owner may, but is not obligated to, license use of its mark to third parties. 
<i>Monsanto</i>, 201 USPQ at 870.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1300-3d110e2019">Sometimes, the owner of a patent asserts ownership of the mark that is applied to goods that are manufactured under license from the patent owner, in accordance with the terms and specifications of the patent. In most cases, these marks have been registered as trademarks, on the basis of related-company use. Generally, the patent owner’s purpose, in arranging for the application of a mark to the goods manufactured under his or her license, would be to identify and distinguish those goods whose nature and quality the patent owner controls through the terms and specifications of the patent. Therefore, registration as a trademark (on the basis of related-company use) rather than registration as a certification mark would be appropriate.
