</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-500-5d70e72">As a general rule, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) does not investigate or evaluate the validity of assignments.  Therefore, the examining attorney should issue an inquiry concerning the compliance of an assignment with the cited provisions of §10 only if:

<p id="TMEP-ch-500-8d70e128">If the examining attorney issues an inquiry, the applicant’s statement that the assignment was in compliance with the cited provision of §10 is sufficient to resolve the issue.  This statement may be entered through an examiner’s amendment.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-500-9d70e131">The assignment of an intent-to-use application to someone who is not the successor to the applicant’s business before filing an allegation of use renders the application void, and any resulting registration must be cancelled.

<i>,</i> 50%) of his or her interest in the mark to another party.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-500-4d70e281">A trademark owner may also assign a separate portion of a business, together with the good will and trademarks associated with that portion of the business, but retain rights in the mark for uses pertaining to another part of the business.  
<i>See VISA, U.S.A., Inc. v. Birmingham Trust National Bank</i>, 696 F.2d 1371, 216 USPQ 649 (Fed. Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 826, 220 USPQ 385 (1983).  Accordingly, one or more trademarks of a company can be validly assigned if the assignor transfers the good will associated with only some of the goods/services on which that mark appears.  After a registration has been assigned with respect to only some of the goods/services, both owners must file the necessary renewal applications and affidavits of continued use or excusable nonuse under 15 U.S.C. §1058 or §1141k to maintain the registration.  If only one party files, only those goods/services in the registration for which that party owns the mark are continued or renewed.  See TMEP §§

<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/dcom/ttab/tbmp/" target="_blank">Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Manual of Procedure</a>
 (“TBMP”) Chapter 1100 regarding concurrent use registration.  However, the Assignment Recordation Branch of the USPTO will record an assignment purporting to transfer rights in an unrestricted registration for less than the entire United States, because it is a transfer that may affect title to the registration.  As noted in 

<a href="tmep-0500.html#TMEP-500d1e430">TMEP §503.01(c)</a>
, the Assignment Recordation Branch does not examine the substance of documents submitted for recording.  The act of recording the document is not a determination of the validity or effect of the purported assignment and does not create a concurrent use registration.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-500-6d70e324">A trademark owner who files a partial assignment is strongly encouraged to file a separate request to divide so that the USPTO can more effectively track and administer applications and post registration filings, and ensure that USPTO records accurately reflect current ownership information.  In pending applications in which a partial assignment and a request to divide are filed, the ITU/Divisional Unit will process the request to divide and ensure that the USPTO records reflect current ownership information.  Because the assignment records of the parent application do not appear in the newly created child application, the ITU staff will place a copy of the Trademark Assignment Abstract of Title for the parent application in the trademark records of the child application.  The abstract will be viewable via the Trademark Image Capture Retrieval System (“TICRS”) and the Trademark Status and Document Retrieval (“TSDR”) portal on the USPTO website at 

<a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/" target="_blank">http://tsdr.uspto.gov/</a>
.  The assignment information in the parent application will remain accessible via the Assignment database on the USPTO website at 

<a href="http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/" target="_blank">http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments</a>
.  After the request to divide is processed and the child application is created, any new recordations in the child application will appear in the Assignment database.  See <a href="tmep-1600.html#TMEP-1600d1e3789">TMEP §§1615</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-500-3d70e1555">When the owner of an application or registration discovers that another party has improperly recorded an assignment, name change, or other interest against the owner’s application or registration, the owner should initially contact the party who filed the improper recording and have that party record corrective documents. See <a href="tmep-0500.html#TMEP-500d1e728">TMEP §503.06(a)</a>
 regarding typographical errors in the cover sheet. If that party files corrective documents, the Assignment Recordation Branch will record the assignment, change of name, or other interest in the correct application or registration, and remove any references to the application or registration in which the improper recording was made. The assignment, change of name, or other interest will remain at the reel and frame number where it was originally recorded, but a search of the assignment records will not associate the improper recording with the owner’s property.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-500-4d70e1558">If the party who recorded the improper document cannot be located or is unwilling to file corrective documents, the owner must file documents to correct the record. Depending on the nature of the error that resulted in the improper recordation, the owner has two options.
</p>
<p id="ch500_d1d7eb_189e8_2a1">If the existing evidence of record clearly demonstrates that the improper assignment, change of name, or other interest recorded against the owner’s application or registration (“owner’s property”) was the result of a typographical error in identifying the application or registration number (e.g., the party who improperly filed mistakenly transposed property numbers), and the improper recording was filed by someone who is not the owner and does not have proper chain of title, the owner may submit a request to the Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy to have any reference of the improper recording removed from the owner’s property. The owner must submit the request in writing, detailing the erroneous information and providing the reel and frame number where the document is recorded, and ask that the recording not be associated with the owner’s property. The request should be faxed to 571-273-8950. The request will only be granted if the current assignment records show on their face that a typographical error caused the recordation against the wrong property and the error was made by someone other than the owner. The request will not be granted if there is a dispute regarding ownership. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-500-5d70e1561">If the record as a whole shows that the application or registration number is consistent with the identified mark and nothing on the face of the recorded document indicates there was an error in identifying the application or registration number, the owner may record corrective documents with the Assignment Recordation Branch. A corrective assignment, name change, or other interest must include: (1) a new complete cover sheet containing the correct owner information; (2) an affidavit or declaration identifying the correct owner, stating why the previously recorded document was not proper, and providing the reel and frame number where the original cover sheet and underlying document is recorded; and (3) the required fee for each application or registration to be corrected (37 C.F.R. §§2.6 and 3.41).

 for information about the cover sheet. 
</p>
<p id="ch500_d1d7eb_18b27_39">The affidavit or declaration must: (1) be signed by someone with firsthand knowledge of the facts; (2) identify the current owner of the application or registration; and (3) state why the document recorded against the application or registration was erroneous, and that the last correct owner or assignee has been and continues to be the owner of the application or registration.
</p>
<p id="ch500_d1d7eb_18bba_248">If corrective documents are filed electronically via ETAS, the owner should check the box titled “Corrective Assignment” in the “Nature of the Conveyance” field and fill in the following required information in the fields provided: (1) identification of the parts of the assignment or change of name that need to be corrected (e.g., name of the receiving party, or trademark application serial number or registration number); (2) the reel and frame number where the original cover sheet is recorded; and (3) identification of the nature of the conveyance that was originally recorded (e.g., assignment of entire interest, change of name). The owner should also write the name of the correct owner of the application or registration in both the assignor (name of the conveying party) and assignee (name of the receiving party) fields to make clear that ownership of the application or registration never changed and the chain of title remains in the last correct owner or assignee.
</p>
<p id="ch500_d1d7eb_18bef_e9">If the corrected documents are filed on paper using the form provided by the Assignment Recordation Branch, the owner should check the box titled “Other” in the section titled “Nature of Conveyance” and, in the space provided, state the following: “Corrective assignment to correct the previously recorded assignment against Property Number ^ (insert trademark application serial number or registration number) recorded at ^ (identify the reel and frame number where the original cover sheet is recorded).” The owner should also write the name of the correct owner of the application or registration in both the assignor (name of the conveying party) and assignee (name of the receiving party) fields to make clear that ownership of the application or registration never changed and the chain of title remains in the last correct owner or assignee.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-500-6d70e1565">Whether filed via ETAS or on paper, if all the filing requirements are met in instances where nothing on the face of the recorded document indicates that there was an error in identifying the application or registration number, the Assignment Recordation Branch will record the corrected assignment or change of name in the identified application or registration, but will not remove the improper recording. However, anyone searching and reviewing the assignment records will see the corrective documents, which clarify the chain of title.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-500-7d70e1568">In the rare case of a dispute in ownership where one party attempts to appropriate ownership of the application or registration by filing an assignment document (or other document affecting title), the other party’s recourse is to record an affidavit or declaration (as explained above) with the Assignment Recordation Branch in support of its position. As noted above, the USPTO’s recordation of documents purporting to affect chain of title is a purely ministerial act and is not an Office determination of the document's validity or of its effect on title to an application or registration. <i>See</i> 37 C.F.R. §3.54;

<p id="TMEP-ch-500-4d70e1614">The goal of the USPTO is to maintain a complete history of claimed interests in a mark.  Since the act of recording a document is not a determination of the document's validity, maintaining a complete record of claimed interests does not preclude an owner from using a mark, or from establishing its ownership of the mark in a proper forum, such as a federal court.
