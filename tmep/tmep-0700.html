<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-700d1e21">702.01  Order of Examination</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e55">In general, applications are assigned for examination in the order in which they are received in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), unless the application is made “special.” See <a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e46">TMEP §702.02</a>
 regarding “special” applications. If a voluntary amendment is filed before the application is assigned for examination, it is placed in the record for consideration at the time the application is assigned to an examining attorney.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e63">Generally, amended applications (i.e., applications that contain a response from the applicant), remands from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (“Board”), and statements of use are also reviewed in the order in which they are received in the USPTO.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e66">Examining attorneys should act on applications that have been suspended as soon as they are removed from suspension. See <a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e2472">TMEP §§716-716.06</a>
 regarding suspension.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-6d80e79">Examining attorneys should immediately act on inquiries regarding applications approved for publication or issue that are returned to the examining attorney to take action or provide information.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-7d80e82">Where appropriate, the managing attorney may direct that a particular case be given special handling.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-8d80e85">When an examining attorney resigns, the examining attorney should spend any remaining time in the Office getting his or her amended cases (including statements of use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(d) and appeal briefs), especially those with involved records, ready for final disposition.

<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-700d1e46">702.02  “Special” Applications</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e97">While the USPTO normally processes applications in the order in which they are received, there are two procedures whereby an application can be made “special,” so that initial examination will be expedited.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e100">
<i>Request to Make Special - Registration Inadvertently Cancelled or Expired Under 15 U.S.C. §1058, §1059, or §1141k</i>. A new application for registration of a mark that was the subject of a previous registration that was inadvertently cancelled or expired under 15 U.S.C. §1058, §1059, or §1141k will be made “special” upon the request of the applicant if the applicant is the prior registrant or the assignee of the prior registrant. No petition fee is required in this situation. However, <i>the mark in the new application must be identical to the mark in the cancelled or expired registration, and the goods/services in the new application must be identical to or narrower than the goods/services in the cancelled or expired registration.</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e107">A request to make an application special because a registration was inadvertently cancelled is reviewed in the Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy. The applicant should first file the application via the Trademark Electronic Application System (“TEAS”). The applicant should then submit a request to make special that includes the newly assigned serial number and the number of the cancelled registration. To ensure proper routing and processing, the Office prefers that the request also be filed electronically. In TEAS, the Request to Make Special form can be accessed at 

<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/teas/eTEASpageG.htm" target="_blank">http://www.uspto.gov</a>
.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-6d80e114">If it is not possible to file the request electronically, it should be faxed to the attention of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy at the following fax number: 571-273-0032.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-7d80e117">If the request is submitted by mail, it should be submitted
<i> separately</i> from the application, marked to the attention of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-8d80e123">
<i>Petition to Make Special. </i>A petition to make “special” is a request to the Director under 37 C.F.R. §2.146 to advance the initial examination of an application out of its regular order. See <a href="tmep-1700.html#TMEP-1700d1e385">TMEP §§1710-1710.02</a>
 regarding the petition requirements and filing procedure.

When assigned a new application, an examining attorney will be assigned the companion applications filed within three months of the filing date of the first assigned application. If an applicant files more than ten applications within a three‑month period, only the first ten will be assigned to one examining attorney. Examining attorneys are encouraged to assign all unassigned companion applications for the same or similar marks to themselves, even if the applications were filed outside the three-month period.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e171">The assignment of companion applications is done electronically, based upon the owner’s name as set forth in the application. Therefore, the owner’s name should be set forth consistently in all applications.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e315">The USPTO will not issue two or more identical registrations on the same register. If two applications on the same register would result in registrations that are exact duplicates, the USPTO will permit only one application to mature into registration, and will refuse registration in the other application. 37 C.F.R. §2.48. For instance, if two identical applications are filed by an applicant, and the USPTO has not taken action in either application, then the USPTO will refuse registration in both applications. However, if the USPTO has already taken action in one of the applications but not the other, then the USPTO will refuse registration in the second application.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e318">The applicant may overcome the refusal(s) by abandoning one of the applications. If practicable, the USPTO will permit the applicant to choose which application should mature into registration.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e321">
<i>Basis. </i>Applications filed under or amended to §1 of the Trademark Act would result in duplicate registrations if the only difference between them is that one is based on use in commerce under §1(a) and the other is based on intent-to-use under §1(b). However, an application filed under §1 and an application filed under §44 that are otherwise identical would not result in duplicate registrations, nor would an application under §66(a) of the Trademark Act that is otherwise identical to an application filed under §1 or §44.

<i>Classification Change. </i>Where the international classification of goods/services has changed, a new application for registration of the same mark for the same goods/services in a different class will not result in a duplicate registration. For example, if applicant owns a registration of a mark for legal services in Class 42, and files a new application after January 1, 2007, for registration of the same mark for legal services in Class 45, this is not a duplicate.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-7d80e624">Registration must be refused only as to the specific register (i.e., Principal or Supplemental) for which registration is requested. However, when refusing registration on the Principal Register, the examining attorney should also state, to the extent possible, whether the record indicates that an amendment to the Supplemental Register or to seek registration on the Principal Register under §2(f) may be appropriate.

<h1 class="page-title">706  New Matter Raised by Examining Attorney After First Action</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e920">If in the first Office action an examining attorney inadvertently failed to refuse registration on a clearly applicable ground or to make a necessary requirement, the examining attorney must take appropriate action to correct the inadvertent error in a subsequent action. Examining attorneys should exercise great care to avoid these situations, and should take this step only when the failure to do so would result in clear error (See <a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e566">TMEP §706.01</a>
). After the first action, supervisors (e.g., supervisors reviewing the quality of the examining attorney’s work) should not introduce any new reason for refusal that is not clearly justified under the Act or rules.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e928">Since it is unusual to make a new refusal or requirement that could have been raised in the first action, an examining attorney who does make a new refusal or requirement must clearly explain why the refusal or requirement is necessary, and apologize for the delay in raising the issue, if appropriate. See <a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e1554">TMEP §711.02</a>
 regarding supplemental Office actions.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e936">Sometimes, the examining attorney must issue a new refusal or requirement because the applicant submits information that raises a new issue.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-6d80e940">In a §66(a) application, the examining attorney cannot issue a new refusal more than 18 months after the date on which the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (“IB”) forwards the request for extension of protection to the USPTO. Thus, if the examining attorney determines that a new ground of refusal exists, a second Office action raising this new ground may be issued only if time remains in the 18-month period. In such a case, the examining attorney must contact the Madrid Processing Unit (“MPU”) upon issuance of the Office action, so that a notification of the new ground of refusal can be sent to the IB.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-700d1e566">706.01  “Clear Error”</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e957">The term “clear error” refers to an administrative internal guideline used by the USPTO to determine whether an examining attorney should issue a refusal or requirement that could or should have been raised in a previous action.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e960">It is the policy of the USPTO to do a complete examination upon initial review of an application by an examining attorney, and to issue all possible refusals and requirements in the first Office action. 
<i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e262">TMEP §704.01</a>
. The USPTO will not issue a new refusal or requirement that could or should have been made in an earlier Office action unless it is necessary to do so to prevent the issuance of a registration that would violate the Trademark Act or applicable rules. 
<i>See, e.g., </i>

<a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e545">TMEP §706</a>
. For example, if evidence is discovered, after publication, that clearly demonstrates the proposed mark is a generic identifier for the goods, registration on either the Principal or Supplemental Register would be in violation of the Trademark Act and the Director will restore jurisdiction to the examining attorney to issue a new refusal of registration . 
<i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-1500.html#TMEP-1500d1e312">TMEP §1504.04</a>
. See also 

<a href="tmep-1100.html#TMEP-1100d1e957">TMEP §1109.08</a>
 regarding the issuance of refusals and requirements during examination of a statement of use that could or should have been issued during initial examination of the application.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e987">The internal “clear error” standard is merely an administrative guideline. It does not confer on an applicant any entitlement to a showing of clear error, nor does it impose a higher standard of proof on the examining attorney than is otherwise required to establish a prima facie case for the refusal or requirement.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-6d80e991">Except as provided in 15 U.S.C. §1141h(c)(4), there is no restriction in the Trademark Act or Trademark Rules of Practice as to the period of time prior to registration when the USPTO may issue a new requirement or new refusal. The USPTO has a duty to issue valid registrations and has broad authority to correct errors made by examining attorneys and other USPTO employees. 
<i>See Last Best Beef LLC v. Dudas</i>, 506 F.3d 333, 340, 84 USPQ2d 1699, 1704 (4th Cir. 2007) (“[F]ederal agencies, including the USPTO, have broad authority to correct their prior errors.”); <i>see also BlackLight Power Inc. v. Rogan</i>, 295 F.3d 1269, 63 USPQ2d 1534 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (affirming that USPTO officials acted within their authority in a reasonable manner when withdrawing a patent from issuance in order to fulfill the USPTO’s mission to issue valid patents, even after Notice of Allowance, payment of the issue fee, and notification of the issue date, and with publication of the drawing and claim in the <i>Official Gazette</i>). Thus, if the USPTO discovers that a mistake made during examination would result in issuance of a registration in violation of the Trademark Act or applicable rules, the USPTO must issue any necessary requirements or refusals, even if they could or should have been previously raised.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-7d80e1003">The question of whether a refusal or requirement was procedurally proper is reviewable on petition under 37 C.F.R. §2.146. However, “[q]uestions of substance arising during the ex parte prosecution of applications, including, but not limited to, questions arising under sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 23 of the Act of 1946, are not considered to be appropriate subject matter for petitions to the Director.” 37 C.F.R. §2.146(b). Thus, the Director cannot consider on petition whether the issuance of or failure to issue a substantive refusal was a “clear error.” See <a href="tmep-1700.html#TMEP-1700d1e115">TMEP §1704</a>
 regarding petitionable subject matter, and 

<a href="tmep-1700.html#TMEP-1700d1e332">TMEP §1706</a>

<a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e759">TMEP §707.02</a>
, the amendment must be specifically authorized by the individual applicant, someone with legal authority to bind a juristic applicant (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership), or the applicant’s qualified practitioner.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e1060">The examining attorney may issue an examiner’s amendment whenever the required amendment does not have to be verified by the applicant. For example, in appropriate circumstances, an examiner’s amendment may be used to amend the identification of goods/services, enter a disclaimer, add the state of incorporation, or amend from the Principal to the Supplemental Register.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-7d80e1099">Examiner’s amendments generally are not used when there are statutory refusals. However, if there is a potential statutory refusal, and an amendment will obviate the refusal, the examining attorney may attempt to resolve the issues through an examiner’s amendment.
</p>
<div id="" class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-1d80e1104">
<i>Example</i>: If the applicant could overcome a surname refusal for a mark that is in use in commerce by amending to the Supplemental Register, the examining attorney may initiate telephone or e-mail contact and suggest the amendment. If the applicant authorizes the amendment, the examining attorney may issue an examiner’s amendment amending the application to the Supplemental Register.

If the applicant agrees to the proposed amendment clarifying the identification, the examining attorney may issue an examiner’s amendment. If the applicant does not agree with the examining attorney’s suggested identification and proposes an amendment that would obviate the refusal as to some, but not all, of registrations, the examining attorney may issue a combined examiner’s amendment/priority action.

However, when it is clear from the outset that amending the identification would not obviate the refusal as to one or more of the registrations, the examining attorney must not initiate telephone or e-mail contact, because it is not possible to offer the applicant a specific action to place the application in condition for publication, suspension, or registration.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-1d80e1134">

The examining attorney would then issue a notice of suspension.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e1540">A “priority action” is an Office action that is issued following a telephone conversation, personal interview, or e-mail communication in which the examining attorney and the individual applicant, someone with legal authority to bind a juristic applicant (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership), or the applicant’s qualified practitioner discuss the various issues raised in an application and what actions the applicant must take to put the application in condition for publication or registration. A priority action is generally used when the action requires verification by the applicant. The use of priority actions is encouraged to expedite examination.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e1543">A priority action should be issued according to the following procedure: (1) the examining attorney telephones or e-mails the applicant or applicant’s qualified practitioner and requests that the applicant take some specific action, explaining the reasons; (2) the applicant or applicant’s qualified practitioner specifically discusses the merits of the application with the examining attorney; (3) the examining attorney prepares and signs a priority action that fully discusses all refusals or requirements, includes evidence to support the refusals and/or requirements, and specifically describes what action the applicant may take in order to put the application into condition for publication or registration; and (4) the USPTO sends a copy of the priority action to the applicant.
</p>

</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-9d80e1786">In the priority action, the examining attorney must clearly state the basis for the refusal that was discussed, citing the relevant sections of the statute and rules, attaching evidence to support the refusal, and indicating the resolutions agreed upon or the options offered.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-10d80e1789">If the priority action includes a final refusal, the priority action must clearly indicate that the refusal is FINAL, and should contain any additional supporting evidence necessary for a complete record on appeal.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e1810">An examining attorney may issue an Office action that combines an examiner’s amendment and priority action, if the requirements for both have been met. The examiner’s-amendment portion reflects the authorized amendments, and the priority-action section addresses the refusals and requirements that remain outstanding and to which the applicant must still respond. An examining attorney may not issue a “no-call” examiner’s amendment/priority action, because the issues in the priority action portion of the action have not been discussed with the applicant or applicant’s qualified practitioner.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e1813">The action must include a six-month response clause (
<i>see</i>

<a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e512">TMEP §705.08</a>
) so that it is clear that the applicant must timely respond to the issues raised in the priority action to avoid abandonment of the application. The action must also include the subheadings “Priority Action” and “Examiner’s Amendment” to facilitate processing.
</p>
<div id="" class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-1d80e1824">
<i>Example</i>: After determining that an application requires a disclaimer and clarification of the entity type and color claim, and that the specimen shows ornamental use of the mark, if the examining attorney obtains authorization from the applicant or applicant’s attorney only to amend the entity type and color claim, a combined examiner’s amendment/priority action may be issued. The examiner’s-amendment section memorializes the amendments to the entity type and color claim. The priority action portion fully addresses the ornamental refusal and disclaimer requirement, includes sufficient evidence to support each, and reiterates the action that would put the application in condition for publication or registration.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-1d80e1833">
<i>Example</i>: If the examining attorney determines that an application lacks the necessary translation statement and that the specimen is unacceptable, and during a discussion of these issues the applicant agrees to entry of a suggested translation statement, but states that she needs to consider what to do about the specimen, the examining attorney may issue a combined examiner’s amendment/priority action. The examiner’s-amendment section memorializes the agreed-upon translation statement. The priority-action portion fully addresses the specimen refusal and includes all actions that would put the application in condition for publication or registration.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-1d80e1841">
<i>Example: </i>If the application contains the “SM” symbol on the drawing, an indefinite identification, and an unclear entity type, the examining attorney may not issue a no-call examiner’s amendment/priority action to delete by examiner’s amendment the “SM” symbol and address by priority action the identification and entity requirements. Since no discussion occurred, the requirements for a priority action have not been met. However, the examining attorney may telephone or e-mail the applicant or applicant’s attorney, discuss the requirements, and issue a combined examiner’s amendment/priority action, if appropriate.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e1900">Personal interviews with examining attorneys concerning applications and other matters pending before the USPTO are permissible on any working day and must be in the office of the respective examining attorney, within office hours that the examining attorney may designate.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e1903">Personal interviews must be arranged in advance, preferably by fax, e-mail, or telephone. This will ensure that the assigned examining attorney will be available for the interview at the scheduled time and will have an opportunity to review the application record. The unexpected appearance of a qualified practitioner or applicant requesting an interview without any previous notice to the examining attorney is not appropriate.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e1906">An interview should be conducted only when it could serve to develop and clarify specific issues and lead to a mutual understanding between the examining attorney and the applicant. Interviews should not extend beyond a reasonable time.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-6d80e1910">The examining attorney should not hesitate to state that matter presented for consideration during the interview requires further research, if this is the case. Furthermore, the examining attorney may conclude an interview when it appears that no common ground can be reached.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-7d80e1913">During an interview with a pro se applicant who is not familiar with USPTO procedure, the examining attorney may in his or her discretion make suggestions that will advance the prosecution of the application, but these interviews should not be allowed to become unduly long.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-8d80e1919">When an agreement is reached during an interview but it is not possible to resolve all issues through an examiner’s amendment, the examining attorney should enter a Note to the File in the record concerning the agreement, and request that the applicant incorporate the agreement in its response.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-9d80e1922">Sometimes, the examining attorney who conducted the interview is transferred, resigns, or retires, and examination of the application is taken over by another examining attorney. If there is an indication in the record that an interview was held, the new examining attorney should endeavor to ascertain whether any agreements were reached during the interview. The new examining attorney should take a position consistent with agreements previously reached, unless doing so would be a clear error (

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e1963">For an interview with an examining attorney who does not have signatory authority, arrangements should be made for the presence of an examining attorney who does have such authority and who is familiar with the application, so that an authoritative agreement may be reached, if possible, at the time of the interview.

This should be done promptly after the interview while the matters discussed are fresh in the minds of the parties.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e1995">If possible, agreements reached in the interview should be incorporated in an examiner’s amendment or priority action.

Similarly, applicants and qualified practitioners may telephone or e-mail examining attorneys, if they feel that a telephone call or e-mail will advance prosecution of an application. See <a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e1189">TMEP §709.05</a>
 regarding guidelines for informal communications. Therefore, all documents filed in connection with the application should include the telephone number of the applicant or the applicant’s qualified practitioner.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e2017">The examining attorney must respond to telephone calls and e-mail messages within a reasonable time, normally the same working day and never later than the next working day.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-6d80e2026">Generally, the examining attorney who prepared the action, and not the supervisory or reviewing examining attorney, should be the person contacted by telephone or e-mail. However, a non-signatory examining attorney must secure proper authorization from the managing attorney, senior attorney, or reviewing examining attorney before approving an amendment.

<i>Apogee Inc.,</i> 47 USPQ2d 1368, 1370-71 (TTAB 1998). When making Internet evidence part of the record, the examining attorney must both (1) provide complete information as to the date the evidence was published or accessed from the Internet, and its source (e.g.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e2253">A list of Internet search results generally has little probative value, because such a list does not show the context in which the term is used on the listed web pages. <i>In re Thomas Nelson, Inc.</i>, 97 USPQ2d 1712, 1715 (TTAB 2011);

Therefore, examining attorneys and applicants should: (a) object to the new evidence but not substantively discuss it; (b) object to the new evidence and, while preserving the objection, discuss why it in any event does not support the offeror’s position; or (c) consider the new evidence.

<i>37 C.F.R. §2.67   Suspension of action by the Patent and Trademark Office.</i>
</h4>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e4258">Action by the Patent and Trademark Office may be suspended for a reasonable time for good and sufficient cause. The fact that a proceeding is pending before the Patent and Trademark Office or a court which is relevant to the issue of registrability of the applicant’s mark, or the fact that the basis for registration is, under the provisions of Section 44(e) of the Act, registration of the mark in a foreign country and the foreign application is still pending, will be considered prima facie good and sufficient cause. An applicant’s request for a suspension of action under this section filed within the 6-month response period (
<i>see</i> §2.62) may be considered responsive to the previous Office action. The first suspension is within the discretion of the Examiner of Trademarks and any subsequent suspension must be approved by the Director.
</p>
</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e4261">The term “suspension of action” means suspending action <i>by the examining attorney</i>. It does not mean suspending or extending an applicant’s time to respond. The Trademark Act requires that an applicant respond within six months of an examining attorney’s Office action, and the examining attorney has no discretion to suspend or extend the time for the applicant’s response. 
<i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. §1062(b). However, an applicant’s timely filed request for suspension for good cause may constitute a proper response to an Office action.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-6d80e4268">When an acceptable ground for suspension is immediately apparent (e.g., prior-filed applications for conflicting marks are pending), the examining attorney will suspend an application only when the application is in condition for approval or final action, except for the matter on which suspension is based. Otherwise, the applicant must request suspension. See <a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e2495">TMEP §716.02</a>
 regarding the circumstances under which action may be suspended.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-700d1e2487">716.01  Form of Suspension Notice</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e4279">In a suspension notice, the examining attorney must specifically state that action is suspended and must omit any reference to a six-month response period. If the application is in condition for a final action but for the matter necessitating suspension, the notice of suspension must clearly indicate which refusals or requirements have been resolved, if any, and which will be made final when the application is removed from suspension. When the application is removed from suspension, the examining attorney must promptly issue a final action, assuming that no new issues have arisen.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e4294">Under 37 C.F.R. §2.67, an examining attorney has the discretion to suspend an application “for good and sufficient cause.” The most common reasons for suspension of an application are discussed below.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e4297">As a general rule, the USPTO will not suspend an application to give an applicant time to secure a consent agreement.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e4300">Any request to stay a deadline for responding to an Office action pending disposition of a petition to the Director should be directed to the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy. If such a request is sent to the examining attorney, the examining attorney should forward it to the Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy. The examining attorney should

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e4318">If the examining attorney refuses registration under §2(d) of the Trademark Act in view of the mark in a prior registration, the applicant may file a petition to cancel the registration under 15 U.S.C. §1064 and, within a proper response period, inform the examining attorney that the petition to cancel has been filed. This will constitute a proper response to the §2(d) refusal, and may be done by telephone, if there are no other outstanding issues that require a written response. The examining attorney will then suspend further action until the termination of the cancellation proceeding, if the application is otherwise in condition for approval or final refusal. The applicant should provide the number of the cancellation proceeding, if available; however, if the applicant does not provide the cancellation number, the examining attorney may ascertain it from USPTO records.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e4321">The examining attorney should suspend further action only if the applicant states that the cancellation proceeding has already been filed or is being filed concurrently with the response to the Office action.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e4324">Although the examining attorney will determine the status of the cancellation proceeding through a routine status check (
<i>see</i>

<a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e2680">TMEP §716.04</a>
), the applicant may call or e-mail to advise the examining attorney when the registration has been cancelled, in order to avoid a delay in removing the application from suspension. The examining attorney must not remove the application from suspension and withdraw the §2(d) refusal until the Trademark database shows that the registration is cancelled or expired.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-6d80e4333">When an application is suspended pending resolution of a cancellation proceeding, it is possible that a settlement agreement filed in the proceeding may be contingent upon the approval of an amendment or acceptance of a consent agreement filed in the suspended application, and the consequent approval of the application for publication. The Board has no jurisdiction over the application that is pending before the examining attorney. Thus, the applicant must file the amendment or consent agreement with the examining attorney, not with the Board. The examining attorney must consider the amendment or agreement and take appropriate action, including approving the application for publication, if appropriate. 
<i>See</i> TBMP §605.03(c).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-7d80e4339">In rare circumstances, the examining attorney may issue an Office action advising an applicant of a conflicting mark in an earlier-filed application and, during the response period, the mark registers and the applicant files a petition to cancel the registration. Although the applicant may respond to the Office action by informing the examining attorney that the petition to cancel has been filed, the examining attorney may not suspend under these circumstances because the application would not be in condition for final refusal if the registration is not cancelled. The examining attorney must first issue a non-final Office action refusing registration. The applicant may then respond by requesting suspension pending the outcome of the cancellation proceeding.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e4359">When an applicant who claims the benefit of a prior foreign application under §44(d) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1126(d), is required to submit a copy of a foreign registration, the applicant may respond to the requirement by stating that the foreign application is still pending. The examining attorney should then suspend further action pending receipt of a copy of the foreign registration, if the application is otherwise in condition for approval for publication, allowance for registration on the Supplemental Register, or final action. 
<i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e224">TMEP §1003.04(a)</a>
. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e4367">If an applicant asserts a claim of priority under §44(d) in addition to another basis, before suspending the application, the examining attorney must inquire whether the applicant wishes to retain §44(e) as a second basis for registration (based on the foreign registration that will issue from the foreign application on which the applicant relied for priority). However, if the application is filed via TEAS and indicates that the applicant is <i>not</i> relying on §44(e) as an additional basis for registration and is only asserting §44(d) to receive a priority filing date, the examining attorney will not inquire and will not suspend further action, but must ensure that the Trademark database is updated accordingly. See <a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e236">TMEP §1003.04(b)</a>
 for further information.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e4375">If the applicant responds that it intends to assert a dual basis for registration and the application is otherwise in condition for approval for publication, allowance for registration on the Supplemental Register, or final action, the examining attorney should suspend further action pending receipt of the foreign registration. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-6d80e4379">During the suspension period, the examining attorney will issue an Office action approximately every six months after suspension to inquire as to the status of the foreign application. If the applicant does not respond to the inquiry, the application will be abandoned.

In a §44(e) application, the examining attorney will not suspend the application pending submission of the foreign registration, unless the applicant establishes that it cannot obtain a copy of the foreign registration due to extraordinary circumstances (e.g.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e4409">When there are conflicting marks in pending applications, action on the application with the later effective filing date will be suspended (if the application appears to be otherwise in condition for publication or issue or for a final action) until the mark in the conflicting application with the earlier effective filing date is either registered or abandoned. 37 C.F.R. §2.83(c). See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e6711">TMEP §§1208–1208.02(f)</a>
 for more information about conflicting marks in pending applications.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e4420">If the examining attorney has cited an earlier-filed pending application, the applicant may respond by arguing that there is no likelihood of confusion between the marks. If the examining attorney is not persuaded by the applicant’s arguments, the examining attorney should suspend the later-filed application pending disposition of the earlier-filed conflicting application. The suspension notice should include a statement that the applicant’s arguments were not persuasive. It is not necessary to address the merits of the applicant’s arguments prior to the initial suspension. See <a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e2661">TMEP §716.03</a>
 regarding the applicant’s request to remove an application from suspension.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e4429">If the examining attorney discovers that an earlier-filed pending application was abandoned, but that a petition to revive is pending, the examining attorney should suspend the later-filed application pending disposition of the petition to revive. If the petition to revive is granted, the later-filed application will remain suspended until the mark in the earlier-filed application is registered or the earlier-filed application is again abandoned.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-6d80e4433">When an application is suspended pending the disposition of more than one earlier-filed conflicting application, and one of the conflicting applications matures into registration, the examining attorney will normally not issue a refusal of registration until all the remaining conflicting application(s) are registered or abandoned, in order to avoid issuing piecemeal refusals. However, if deemed appropriate, the examining attorney does have the discretion to issue a refusal of registration under §2(d) in this situation. 
</p>
<p id="ch700_d1d850_1c390_1b4">Sometimes, the applicant will file an opposition to the registration of the earlier-filed conflicting mark. In this situation, it is possible that a settlement agreement filed in the Board proceeding may be contingent upon the approval of an amendment or acceptance of a consent agreement filed in the suspended application, and the consequent approval of the application for publication. The Board has no jurisdiction over the application that is pending before the examining attorney. Thus, the applicant must file the amendment or consent agreement with the examining attorney, not with the Board. The examining attorney must consider the amendment or agreement and take appropriate action.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-700d1e2582">716.02(d)  Inter Partes or Court Proceeding</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e4448">When an examining attorney learns that a proceeding relevant to the registrability of an applicant’s mark is pending before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board or a court, the examining attorney should call the proceeding to the applicant’s attention. If the applicant is not a party to the inter partes or court proceeding, the examining attorney must explain why the proceeding is relevant to the registrability of the applicant’s mark. If the examining attorney believes the proceeding may result in a decision that supports a refusal of registration of the applicant’s mark, the examining attorney must issue the refusal and give the applicant an opportunity to respond before suspending the application.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e4451">When an applicant requests suspension because a proceeding relevant to the registrability of the applicant’s mark is pending before the Board or a court, the applicant must submit a copy of the relevant pleadings, the docket number of the proceeding, and a written explanation of why the proceeding is relevant to the registrability of the mark. Normally, a court proceeding is not considered relevant to the registrability of a mark unless the remedy requested in the proceeding is cancellation, abandonment, or amendment of a relevant application or registration. However, when resolution of the court action requires the court to consider questions of USPTO policy or procedure, the examining attorney should not assume that the court would prefer to decide such questions absent the USPTO’s decision in the consideration of an application. In these instances, action on an application should generally not be suspended. It is important to review the relevant pleadings, including the complaint and answer, before determining whether suspension is appropriate. The Office of the Solicitor may be consulted if there is a question as to whether suspension of the application is appropriate.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e4454">A third party who wishes to request suspension of a pending application because a proceeding relevant to the registrability of the mark is pending before a court must do so by filing a letter of protest. 
<i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-1700.html#TMEP-1700d1e853">TMEP §1715–1715.06</a>
. The litigation must be specifically identified and a copy of the relevant pleadings must be enclosed. The litigation must involve a federally registered mark or prior pending application, and the protestor must allege that there is a likelihood of confusion between this mark and the mark in the application that is the subject of the letter of protest. Normally, a court proceeding is not considered relevant to the registrability of a mark unless the remedy requested in the proceeding is abandonment or amendment of the application that is the subject of the letter of protest. If the letter of protest is granted, the examining attorney is informed that a request for suspension has been received based on an alleged likelihood of confusion with a registered mark or prior pending application that is the subject of pending litigation.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-6d80e4461">Before an application is suspended, the applicant must respond to all outstanding issues raised in the examining attorney’s Office action that are not related to the proceeding.

The examining attorney must not suspend the application, but must advise the applicant that the grace period for filing the §8 or §71 affidavit or §9 renewal application has passed and that it appears that the registration may be subject to cancellation under §8 or §71 and/or expiration under §9.

On November 5, 2010, the examining attorney issues an Office action regarding the acceptability of the specimen and the applicant responds on November 8, 2010 but does not correct the specimen deficiency. The examining attorney then issues a final Office action on November 29, 2010 regarding the specimen issue. If the applicant files a timely “insurance” extension request on or before March 30, 2011, this would extend the time to perfect the statement of use to September 30, 2011.

In an application under §66(a), if the applicant states that a request to record a change of ownership has been filed with the IB but is not yet recorded, and the application is in condition to be approved for publication, the examining attorney should suspend action pending recordation of the document and entry of the information into the Trademark database.

If, in response, the applicant indicates that it has a currently pending application before ICANN for a Registry Agreement for the gTLD identified by its mark, and the applicant has otherwise demonstrated that the mark consisting of the gTLD could function as a mark, the examining attorney may suspend the application until the resolution of the applicant’s pending application with ICANN.

The applicant should state the reasons for the belief that the suspension is improper and attach any relevant evidence.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e4602">If persuaded by the request, the examining attorney should remove the application from suspension, resume examination of the application, and take appropriate action.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e4605">If not persuaded by the request, the examining attorney must issue a new suspension action <i>that addresses the applicant’s arguments and explains the reasons why the request is not granted</i>. The applicant’s recourse is to file a petition to the Director to review the examining attorney’s action continuing the suspension. The Director will reverse the examining attorney’s action only where there has been clear error or an abuse of discretion. See <a href="tmep-1700.html#TMEP-1700d1e1">TMEP Chapter 1700</a>

<p id="ch700_d1ff02_226fb_27b">If an applicant argues preemptively against suspension based on a conflicting mark in a prior-filed application, and the examining attorney finds the arguments unpersuasive, the examining attorney must include a statement to that effect in the suspension notice.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e4641">In certain circumstances, if the application has been suspended for six months or more, the examining attorney will issue an Office action inquiring as to the status of the matter on which suspension was based. For example, if action is suspended pending the receipt of a copy of a foreign registration or proof of renewal of a foreign registration, the examining attorney will inquire every six months during the suspension period as to the status of the foreign application or registration. Similarly, for applications that are suspended pending the outcome of a civil action, the examining attorney will inquire every six months as to the status of the proceeding. If the foreign application or the civil action is still pending, a statement by the applicant to this effect is a proper response.
</p>
<p id="ch700_d1d850_1e8e2_338">If the applicant does not respond to the suspension inquiry, the application will be abandoned for failure to respond. To expedite processing, the USPTO recommends that the applicant’s response to a suspension inquiry be filed through TEAS, at 

<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/teas/index.jsp" target="_blank">http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/teas/index.jsp</a>

This may occur, for example, when the applicant files a petition to cancel a cited registration or in the limited circumstance in a Section 1(b) application when the applicant files a timely “insurance” extension request but the six-month response period may expire before the end of the extension period.

. The examining attorney should not “withdraw the finality” of the refusal in order to suspend; however, in the suspension notice, the examining attorney should inform the applicant that the refusal of registration is continued but that it is not necessary to respond to the final refusal until the application is removed from suspension.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e4680">If the application is eventually removed from suspension and the grounds for refusal remain operative, the examining attorney should issue an “Examiner’s Subsequent Final Refusal,” thereby reissuing the final refusal, and the applicant will have six months to respond. It is inappropriate to remove the case from suspension and immediately declare the application abandoned.

Under such circumstances, it is not appropriate to give a partial-abandonment advisory. If the applicant does not respond to the Office action, the entire application will be abandoned.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e5503">Applications that are abandoned after ex parte appeals or inter partes proceedings are considered abandoned as of the date of the action by the Board that caused the application to abandon (e.g., affirming the examining attorney’s refusal or sustaining an opposition). However, the Trademark database transaction reporting the abandonment is not performed until a month after expiration of the period for appeal from the Board’s decision.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e5515">When an abandoned application is revived or reinstated, the examining attorney must conduct a new search of USPTO records for conflicting marks. If the search shows that the same examining attorney handled a later-filed conflicting application that has been approved for publication, the examining attorney should request jurisdiction (

<a href="tmep-1500.html#TMEP-1500d1e330">TMEP §1504.04(a)</a>
) and suspend the later-filed application pending disposition of the earlier-filed (revived) application. 37 C.F.R. §2.83(c); 

<a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e6847">TMEP §1208.02(c)</a>
. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-4d80e5524">If the new search shows that the same examining attorney handled a later-filed conflicting application that has been approved for registration, the examining attorney should withdraw the application from issue (if possible) and suspend it. However, if a later-filed conflicting application is already registered, the USPTO is without authority to cancel the registration. The examining attorney must refuse registration of the earlier-filed (revived) application under 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). In this situation, an applicant may file a petition to cancel the registration under Section 14 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1064.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e5527">If the later-filed conflicting application is being handled by a different examining attorney, the examining attorney handling the earlier-filed (revived) application should e-mail the other examining attorney to notify him or her of the revival or reinstatement. The examining attorney handling the later-filed application will follow the procedures set forth above.

<h1 class="page-title">719  Non-Responsive Communications</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e5558">An inquiry, a request to extend the response period, or a communication on a matter unrelated to the outstanding Office action should be treated as a “non-responsive communication,” not as an incomplete response to an outstanding Office action. If the applicant files a non-responsive communication while an Office action is outstanding, the examining attorney should send the applicant a letter (i.e., Examiner's Non-Responsive Amendment) acknowledging receipt of the communication, noting that the communication is non-responsive, and advising the applicant that, to avoid abandonment, a response to the outstanding Office action must be received within six months of the issuance date of the outstanding Office action. If no response to the Office action is received within six months of the issuance date, the application must be abandoned for failure to respond.

<p id="TMEP-ch-700-3d80e5570">If an examining attorney suspects the possibility of fraud upon the USPTO in the ex parte examination of a trademark application, the following procedure must be followed.
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull">(1) The examining attorney must bring the matter to the attention of the managing attorney.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(2) If the managing attorney concurs with the examining attorney as to the possibility of fraud upon the USPTO, the managing attorney will bring the matter to the attention of the Administrator for Trademark Policy and Procedure.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(3) If the Administrator believes that the matter warrants further action, he or she will make an appropriate recommendation to the Commissioner for Trademarks.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-700-5d80e5599">Under no circumstances should any USPTO communication pertaining to fraud be made, either orally or in writing, by anyone in the Trademark Examining Operation, except as set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 above.
