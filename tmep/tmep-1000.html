<h1 class="page-title">1001 Section 44 Applications - General</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-3d95e18">The United States has assumed certain obligations from agreements adopted at the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883 and subsequent revisions to these agreements. The United States is also a member of the Inter-American Convention for Trademarks and Commercial Protection (also known as the “Pan-American Convention”), the Buenos Aires Convention for the Protection of Trade Marks and Commercial Names, the World Trade Organization, and certain other treaties and agreements. See <a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e80">TMEP §1002.03</a> and <a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/appendix_b.htm" target="_blank">Appendix B</a> of this Manual for additional information about treaties and international agreements.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-4d95e27">Section 44 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1126, implements these agreements. Section 44 applications fall into two basic categories: (1) United States applications relying on foreign applications to secure a priority filing date in the United States under §44(d); and (2) United States applications relying on ownership of foreign registrations as a basis for registration in the United States under §44(e). See <a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e150">TMEP §§1003</a>

<i>et seq.</i> regarding §44(d), and 

<a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e297">TMEP §§1004</a>

<i>et seq.</i> regarding §44(e).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-5d95e36">Section 44(d) of the Act provides only a basis for receipt of a priority filing date, <i>not</i> a basis for publication or registration. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e208">TMEP §1003.03</a>. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-6d95e43">An applicant may file an application based solely on §44, or may claim §44 in addition to §1(a) or §1(b) as a filing basis. An applicant who claims more than one basis must comply with all application requirements for each basis asserted. 37 C.F.R. §2.34. See TMEP §§

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e765">806.02–806.02(g)</a> regarding multiple-basis applications and §§

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e933">806.03(j)-806.03(j)(iii)</a> regarding amending the basis after publication.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-7d95e49">In an application based solely on §44, the applicant must submit a verified statement that the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce, but use in commerce is not required prior to registration.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-3d95e80">To be eligible for registration under §44(e), an applicant must meet the following requirements:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull">(1) The applicant’s country of origin must be a party to a treaty or agreement with the United States that provides for registration based on ownership of a foreign registration, or must extend reciprocal registration rights to nationals of the United States (15 U.S.C. §1126(b)); and

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-6d95e112">If an applicant does not meet the requirements listed above, the examining attorney must refuse registration under §44(e). 
<i>See</i>
<i>SARL Corexco v. Webid Consulting Ltd</i>., ___ USPQ2d ____, Cancellation No. 92056456 (TTAB Mar. 27, 2014). The applicant may amend the application to claim §1(a) or §1(b) as a basis. See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e829">TMEP §§806.03</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-7d95e119">An applicant domiciled in the United States cannot obtain registration under §44(e) unless the applicant is the owner of a registration from an eligible country other than the United States and the applicant can establish that the foreign country is the applicant’s country of origin.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-3d95e140">To be eligible for a priority filing date under §44(d), an applicant must meet the following requirements:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull">(1) The applicant’s country of origin must be a party to an international treaty or agreement with the United States that provides a right of priority, or must extend reciprocal rights to priority to United States nationals; and
</li>
<li class="nobull">(2) The foreign application that is the basis for the priority claim must be filed in a country that either is a party to a treaty or agreement with the United States that provides a right of priority, or extends reciprocal rights to priority to United States nationals.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-5d95e160">15 U.S.C. §§1126(b) and (d).</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-6d95e163">See <a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e107">TMEP §1002.04</a> regarding the applicant’s country of origin, and 

<a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e80">TMEP §1002.03</a> and 

<a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/appendix_b.htm" target="_blank">Appendix B</a> for information about how to determine whether a particular country is a party to an international treaty or agreement that provides a right of priority to United States nationals.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-7d95e176">If an applicant does not meet the requirements listed above, the examining attorney must advise the applicant that it is not entitled to priority. If the applicant has not claimed another filing basis, the examining attorney must require the applicant to claim and perfect an acceptable basis before the application can be approved for publication or registration on the Supplemental Register. See <a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e208">TMEP §1003.03</a>
 regarding registration basis for §44 applications and 

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e829">TMEP §§806.03</a>

<i>et seq.</i> regarding amendment of the basis. The examining attorney must ensure that the priority claim is deleted from the Trademark database and conduct a new search of the records of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for conflicting marks.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-8d95e185">To obtain a priority filing date under §44(d), the foreign application does <i>not</i> have to be filed in the applicant’s country of origin. However, to obtain registration under §44(e) based on the foreign registration that will issue from the application on which the applicant relies for priority, the applicant must establish that the country in which the application was filed is its country of origin. 

<a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e32">TMEP §1002.01</a>. Therefore, if the applicant files a §44(d) priority claim based on an application from a treaty country other than the country in which the applicant is domiciled, the examining attorney must advise the applicant that in order to rely on the registration issuing from the identified foreign application as its basis for registration, the applicant will be required to establish that the country where the foreign application was filed is its country of origin.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-9d95e191">It is important to keep in mind that while §44(d) provides a basis for filing and a priority filing date, it does not provide a basis for publication or registration. A party who files under §44(d) must establish a basis for registration. 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(4)(iii); 

<a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e208">TMEP §1003.03</a>. For example, a French corporation may rely on a first-filed application in Canada for its priority claim under §44(d), regardless of whether Canada is the applicant’s country of origin. However, before the mark can be published for opposition in the United States, the French corporation must do one of the following: (1) establish Canada as its country of origin and rely on the prospective Canadian registration as its basis for registration in the United States (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e32">TMEP §§1002.01</a> and 

<a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e107">1002.04</a>); (2) assert use in commerce under §1(a) and/or a bona fide intention to use in commerce under §1(b) as its basis for publication in the United States; or (3) rely on a registration from France as its basis for registration in the United States.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-10d95e203">An applicant domiciled or organized in the United States may claim priority under §44(d) based on ownership of an application <i>in a treaty country other than the United States</i>. See <a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e127">TMEP §1002.05</a>.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-3d95e224">In a §44 application, the examining attorney must confirm that: (1) both the applicant’s country of origin and the country where the applicant has filed the application or obtained registration are parties to a treaty or agreement with the United States (or that they extend reciprocal rights to United States nationals by law); <i>and</i> (2) the specific benefit that the applicant is claiming under §44 (i.e., the right to a priority filing date under §44(d) and/or the right to registration under §44(e)) is provided for under the treaty or agreement.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-4d95e233">To determine whether a particular country has a treaty with the United States that provides for the benefit that the applicant is claiming under §44, examining attorneys should consult 

<a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/appendix_b.htm" target="_blank">Appendix B</a> of this manual. Appendix B lists the members of the Paris Convention, Inter-American Convention, Buenos Aires Convention, World Trade Organization, European Union (“EU”), and certain countries entitled to reciprocal treatment under other international agreements, as well as websites where examining attorneys can obtain updated information about these treaties or agreements.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-5d95e239">In a §44 application or an amendment adding or substituting §44 as a basis, an eligible applicant may rely on an application filed in or registration issued by certain common offices of several states. A “common office of several states” refers to an entity serving as the issuing office for trademark registrations for an established group of countries. Examples include the Benelux Trademark Office, servicing Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg; and the African Intellectual Property Organization (“OAPI”), which issues registrations covering all member states (i.e., Benin, Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Togo).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-6d95e243">An applicant may also claim the benefits of §44 based on an application for or registration of a Community Trade Mark, if the applicant has a bona fide and effective industrial or commercial establishment in a country or state that is a member of the EU, formerly known as the European Community (EC) or European Economic Community (EEC). See Appendix B for a list of these countries.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-7d95e246">If an eligible applicant filed an application or obtained a registration in a country that is a member of the Paris Convention, Inter-American Convention, World Trade Organization, or European Union, the applicant can claim the benefits of either §44(d) or §44(e), if the applicant meets the requirements of those sections. An eligible applicant may also file under <i>either</i> §44(e) or §44(d) based on an application filed or registration obtained in Taiwan. On the other hand, if the applicant filed an application or obtained a registration in a country that is a member of the Buenos Aires Convention, the applicant may seek registration under §44(e), but may <i>not</i> obtain a priority filing date under §44(d). See <a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/appendix_b.htm" target="_blank">Appendix B</a> for additional information.
</p>

<a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/appendix_b.htm" target="_blank">Appendix B</a>
, an applicant can establish its eligibility for the benefits of §44 by providing evidence of statutes or agreements establishing reciprocity between the United States and the relevant country. Examining attorneys may also consult sources such as <i>Trademarks Throughout the World</i> (Anne-Laure Covin, 5th ed. 2008) and <i>World Trademark Law and Practice</i> (Ethan Horwitz, 2nd ed. 2008), available to USPTO employees in the Trademark Law Library, for information about the trademark laws of foreign countries.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-4d95e289">Section §44(c) of the Trademark Act defines the applicant’s country of origin as “the country in which he has a bona fide and effective industrial or commercial establishment, or if he has not such an establishment, the country in which he is domiciled, or if he has not a domicile in any of the countries described in paragraph (b) of this section, the country of which he is a national.” Under this definition, an applicant can have more than one country of origin. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-5d95e292">If a §44 applicant is domiciled or incorporated in the country claimed, the examining attorney should presume that the country is the applicant’s country of origin, and should not issue any inquiry about the applicant’s country of origin.

In this context, applicant is to be construed broadly, as defined in 15 U.S.C. §1127, to embrace the legal representatives, predecessors, successors, and assigns of the original owner of the foreign application or registration. Thus, an applicant for registration in the United States who is the assignee of a foreign registration, but cannot establish that the country which issued the registration is its country of origin prior to the assignment, or to the filing of the United States application, may still claim the benefit of registration under §44(e) because the requirement that the applicant be the owner of a valid registration from the applicant’s country of origin was perfected by its predecessor in interest.

<p id="ch1000_d1feff_1d801_30d">Generally, a written statement by the applicant or the applicant’s attorney that the applicant has had a bona fide and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the relevant country during the six-month priority period beginning at the date of filing of the foreign application (for §44(d) applicants), or as of the date of issuance of the foreign registration (for §44(e) applicants), will be sufficient to establish that the country is the applicant’s country of origin. This statement does not have to be verified. If a §44(d) applicant establishes its country of origin by submitting this statement, and later perfects its §44 basis by submitting a foreign registration issued by the same country, it is not necessary to require another statement as to the foreign registration.

If the examining attorney is unable to reach the applicant by telephone or e-mail, he or she must issue an Office action. If the applicant responds by telephone or e-mail, the examining attorney must issue an examiner’s amendment to enter the statement into the record.

<p id="ch1000_d1b20b_279cc_1e">If any evidence in the record contradicts the applicant’s assertion that it has a bona fide and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the relevant country, the examining attorney should require the applicant to set forth the specific circumstances which establish that the applicant maintains a bona fide and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the country. Relevant factors include the presence of production facilities, business offices, and personnel.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1000d1e182">1003.01  The “First-Filed” Requirement</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-3d95e497">The application relied upon under §44(d) must be the applicant’s first application filed in any treaty country for the same mark and for the same goods or services. The USPTO will presume that the application identified as the basis for the priority claim was the first filed, unless there is contradictory evidence in the record (e.g., in the application itself or submitted via a Letter of Protest that has been accepted; See <a href="tmep-1700.html#TMEP-1700d1e867">TMEP §1715.01</a> regarding appropriate subjects to be raised in a letter of protest). If the first-filed application was withdrawn, abandoned, or otherwise disposed of without having any rights outstanding, and did not serve as a basis for claiming a right of priority, the §44(d) priority claim may be based upon a subsequently filed application in the same foreign country or common office of several states. Generally, a written explanation by the applicant or the applicant’s attorney that the first-filed application was withdrawn, abandoned, or otherwise disposed of without having any rights outstanding, and did not serve as a basis for claiming a right of priority, will be sufficient. 
</p>
<p id="ch1000_d1feff_1dc5f_1fa">The requirement for the same goods or services means that the goods or services cannot exceed the scope of the goods or services in the foreign application and must be different from those covered by any previous application or registration for the mark in a treaty country. Thus, for example, if evidence in the record indicates that an applicant who owns a French registration for “coats, hats, and ties” subsequently files an application with the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (“OHIM”) for “coats, hats, ties, and shoes,” and then files a United States application within six months seeking a priority filing date for “coats, hats, ties, and shoes” based on the OHIM application, the §44(d) priority claim would be valid only as to “shoes” because the OHIM application was not the first filed in a treaty country for “coats, hats, and ties.” Note, however, that if the foreign application that formed the basis for the French registration is still within the six-month priority period, because, for example, the French registration was issued on the filing date of the foreign application, that foreign application can serve as a basis for priority for the “coats, hats, and ties.”
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-6d95e507">If the examining attorney determines that the application relied on was not the first filed in any treaty country as to some or all of the goods/services, the examining attorney must advise the applicant that it is not entitled to priority as to the relevant goods/services. If the applicant has not claimed another filing basis, the examining attorney must require the applicant to claim and perfect a basis for any goods/services not entitled to priority before the application can be approved for publication or for registration on the Supplemental Register.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-3d95e674">To determine priority for publication under 37 C.F.R. §2.83, an application filed in the United States under §44(d) will be treated as if it were filed in the United States on the same date as the filing in the foreign country. The §44(d) application will receive priority over any application filed after the §44(d) applicant’s priority filing date that might otherwise be a possible bar to registration under §2(d) of the Trademark Act due to a likelihood of confusion. See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e6711">TMEP §§1208</a>

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-4d95e680">In some cases, another United States application filed after the §44(d) applicant’s priority date may proceed to publication or registration because the §44(d) applicant had not yet filed in the United States when the examining attorney searched USPTO records for conflicting marks. If the USPTO learns that a §44(d) application is entitled to priority over another pending application before the other mark registers, the USPTO will take appropriate action to give the §44(d) application the priority to which it is entitled.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-5d95e683">If an examining attorney discovers a conflicting application entitled to priority under §44(d) after taking action in a case, the examining attorney should issue a supplemental action correcting the situation.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-5d95e855">An English translation of a registration from the country of origin by itself is not an acceptable “copy” of the foreign registration.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-4d95e885">If the record indicates that the foreign registration has expired or will expire before the United States registration will issue, the examining attorney must require that an applicant submit a certificate of renewal or other certification from the intellectual property office of the foreign country, or a copy of the foreign registration that shows that the foreign registration has been renewed and will be in force at the time the registration issues in the United States, along with an English translation. 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(3)(iii). See <a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e358">TMEP §1004.01(b)</a> regarding translation of foreign registrations and renewal documents. A photocopy of the intellectual property office’s publications or a printout from the intellectual property office’s website is not sufficient to establish that the registration has been renewed in that country and is in full force and effect, unless accompanied by a certification from the issuing office. Currently, the only exception is for renewals of Singapore registrations. As of January 1, 2009, Singapore ceased issuing certificates confirming that a registration has been renewed. Therefore, a printout from the Singapore intellectual property office website showing the extended expiration date of the foreign registration is acceptable as proof of renewal.
</p>
<p id="ch1000_d1feff_1e28f_1c">Generally, the examining attorney should require proof of renewal if it appears that the foreign registration will expire within six months after the date of approval for publication. If the applicant states that renewal is pending in the foreign country, the examining attorney should suspend the application pending receipt of proof of renewal.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-6d95e895">If an applicant submits a certified copy or certification of the foreign registration that is certified by the foreign government agency who issued the foreign registration, the examining attorney should inquire concerning renewal only if the certified copy of the foreign registration indicates that the registration will expire <i>after</i> the date on which the foreign government agency issued the certified copy or certification of the foreign registration. For example, if a certified copy of a foreign registration was issued by the trademark agency in the foreign country on January 5, 2009, and the certified copy indicates that the registration expired on June 1, 2008, no inquiry is necessary. The USPTO presumes that the foreign country would not have issued a certified copy of the registration unless the registration had been renewed. This applies <i>only</i> to a certified copy or certification issued <i>by the foreign trademark agency</i>. If the copy of the registration is not certified by the foreign trademark agency, and the record indicates that the foreign registration will expire before the United States registration will issue, the examining attorney must require that the applicant submit a copy of the foreign registration showing that the registration has been renewed.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-7d95e898">If the examining attorney determines that the foreign registration is not in force, the examining attorney will refuse registration under §44(e). The applicant may amend the application to claim another basis. See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e829">TMEP §§806.03</a>

<i>Section 44 Claimed in Original Application</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-4d95e954">If an applicant claims §44 as the filing basis in the original United States application, or if the applicant omits the basis from the original United States application and subsequently claims §44 as the basis, the applicant must be the owner of the foreign application or registration on the filing date of the United States application. 
<i>See</i>
<i>In re De Luxe, N.V</i>., 990 F.2d 607, 26 USPQ2d 1475 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <i>SARL Corexco v. Webid Consulting Ltd</i>., ___ USPQ2d ____, Cancellation No. 92056456 (TTAB Mar. 27, 2014); <i>In re Tong Yang Cement Corp.</i>, 19 USPQ2d 1689 (TTAB 1991).

<p id="ch1000_d1feff_1e499_137">Generally, the applicant is not required to submit a copy of the foreign application to receive a priority filing date. <i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e150">TMEP §1003</a>. However, if other evidence in the record calls into question the applicant’s ownership of the foreign application on the filing date of the United States application, the examining attorney must require the applicant to establish its ownership of the foreign application on the date of filing in the United States. For example, if the United States application includes a priority claim under §44(d), and the applicant then attempts to perfect its §44 filing basis by submitting a foreign registration showing a different owner name from that of the United States applicant, this difference raises a question as to the applicant’s ownership of the underlying foreign application. Therefore, the examining attorney must issue a request for information under §2.61(b), requiring the applicant to establish its ownership of the foreign application on the date of filing in the United States, and advise the applicant that if it did not own the foreign application on the filing date of the United States application, the applicant is not entitled to priority and the claim will be deleted. The examining attorney must also refuse registration under §44(e) because the record indicates that the applicant is not the owner of a valid registration in the applicant’s country of origin. 15 U.S.C. §1126(c) and (e); 

<a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e32">TMEP §1002.01</a>. If the applicant provides proof that it was the owner of the foreign application on the date of filing in the United States, the application will retain the priority filing date. However, the applicant must additionally satisfy the requirements for registration under §44(e).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-5d95e957">Proof of ownership must show the applicant for registration in the United States as the owner of the foreign application or registration as of the date of filing in the United States and may consist, for example, of a copy of an assignment document, a statement from the agency administering the trademark register in the foreign country establishing that the applicant was the owner of the foreign application or registration as of the United States application filing date, or a printout from the intellectual property office’s website. Note that while a website printout may suffice for purposes of establishing ownership, for purposes of proof of the status of a foreign registration, a printout generally is not acceptable. See <a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e322">TMEP §§1004.01</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-3d95e1251">Section 44 applicants often try to amend the mark in the United States application to overcome an objection that the mark in the drawing does not agree with the mark in the foreign registration. Amendments to drawings in §44 applications are governed by 37 C.F.R. §2.72(c). An applicant cannot amend the drawing in the United States application to conform to the mark in the foreign registration if the amendment would result in a material alteration of the mark on the drawing submitted with the original application in the United States. 
<i>In re Hacot-Colombier</i>, 105 F.3d 616, 41 USPQ2d 1523 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <i>In re Wine Society of America Inc.</i>, 12 USPQ2d 1139 (TTAB 1989). Thus, when a §44 applicant proposes to amend its drawing, the examining attorney must consider: (1) whether the proposed amendment of the drawing would result in a material alteration of the mark on the original drawing; <i>and</i> (2) whether the proposed amendment would result in a mark that is a substantially exact representation of the mark in the foreign registration. In
<i> In re Larios S.A.,</i> 35 USPQ2d 1214, 1216 (TTAB 1995), the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board held that the mark “GRAN VINO MALAGA LARIOS” and design on the drawing originally filed with the United States application was not a substantially exact representation of the mark “VINO DE MALAGA LARIOS” with a similar design in the foreign registration; however, the Board found that amendment of the drawing to conform to the foreign registration was <i>not</i> a material alteration within the meaning of 37 C.F.R. §2.72. The Board noted that “[t]he material alteration test ... is not quite as rigorous as the substantially exact representation standard and thus allows for a bit more leeway or flexibility with respect to ... amendment of the drawing....” 35 USPQ2d at 1217. See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1885">TMEP §§807.14</a>

<i>et seq.</i> regarding material alteration.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1000d1e510">1011.04  Drawings and Descriptions of Three-Dimensional and Non-Visual Marks</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-3d95e1266">If the foreign application or registration depicts several views of a three-dimensional mark, the examining attorney must require the applicant to comply with 37 C.F.R. §2.52(b)(2), and submit an acceptable drawing that depicts a single rendition of the mark. See generally 

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1103">TMEP §§807</a>

<i>et seq.</i> regarding drawings. In the alternative, the applicant may petition the Director, pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §2.146(a)(5), to waive the requirement and accept a drawing featuring multiple views of the mark. See TMEP Chapter 1700 regarding petitions to the Director.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-4d95e1272">In all such cases, the applicant must indicate that the mark is three-dimensional. 37 C.F.R. §2.52(b)(2); 

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1689">TMEP §807.10</a>. If necessary to adequately depict the commercial impression of the mark, the applicant may be required to submit a drawing that shows the placement of the mark by surrounding the mark with a proportionately accurate broken-line representation of the particular goods, packaging, or advertising on which the mark appears. The applicant must also use broken lines to show matter not claimed as part of the mark. For any drawing using broken lines to indicate placement of the mark, or matter not claimed as part of the mark, the applicant must include a written description of the mark and explain the purpose of the broken lines, e.g., by indicating that the matter shown by the broken lines is not a part of the mark and that it serves only to show the position of the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.52(b)(4); 

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1644">TMEP §807.08</a>. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-5d95e1281">With respect to sound, scent, and other non-visual marks, an applicant is not required to submit a drawing, but must submit a detailed description of the mark. 

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1656">TMEP §807.09</a>. If the foreign registration includes a drawing, such as a musical staff depicting the notes of which a sound mark is comprised, the United States application need not include such a drawing. As the drawing of the mark must be a substantially exact representation of the mark in the foreign registration, and the description of the mark defines the mark sought to be registered in a non-visual mark, the description of the mark in the United States application must be substantially comparable to any description of the mark in the foreign application or registration. 37 C.F.R. §§2.51(c) and 2.52(e).

See TMEP Chapter 1900 regarding international registration. A <i>request</i> for an extension of protection of the international registration to applicant’s country of origin is not sufficient.
</p>

If the applicant’s country of origin does not issue registrations or certificates of extension of protection, the applicant may submit a copy of the international registration, showing that protection of the international registration has been extended to applicant’s country of origin.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-8d95e1388">An extension of protection of an international registration cannot be the basis for a §44(d) application, because neither the international application nor the request for extension of protection is the first application filed in a treaty country for the same mark for the same goods or services. 15 U.S.C. §1126(d); 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(4)(i)(A) and (B); 

<a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e182">TMEP §1003.01</a>. The basic application or basic registration upon which the international registration is based was the first-filed application.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1000-9d95e1394">If an applicant wants to base a §44(e) application on the basic registration that was the basis for the international registration, the applicant must submit a copy of the basic registration issued by the Office of Origin, i.e., the country or intergovernmental organization who issued the registration which provided the basis for the international registration (See <a href="tmep-1900.html#TMEP-1900d1e21">TMEP §1901</a> regarding the Office of Origin). The applicant cannot submit the international registration, because an international registration does not provide protection in the territory of the Contracting Party whose office is the Office of Origin.
