<div xmlns="" class="Section" id="TMEP-300d1e7">
<h1 class="page-title">301
   
 Electronic Filing
</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-3d60e18">The Trademark Electronic Application System
 (“TEAS”) makes electronic filing available on the United States Patent and Trademark
 Office (“USPTO”) website, at 
<b>
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/teas/e-TEAS/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.uspto.gov</a>
</b>.  TEAS can be used to file all forms related
 to a domestic application or registration, or for filings under the Madrid Protocol.
  TEAS offers a group of specific forms that require direct data entry in designated
 fields, and/or the attachment of a .jpg or .pdf image file.  For documents for which a
 specific TEAS form has not yet been developed, TEAS also offers a “global form”
 approach.  On the global form, the filer can indicate the type of filing through the use
 of a pull-down menu from one of four categories:  Intent-to-Use matters;
 Post-Registration matters; Petitions and similar matters; and a miscellaneous category.
  The filer then uploads a .jpg or .pdf image file that contains the complete text for
 the actual filing.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-4d60e24">When a document is filed electronically, either as
 a specific TEAS form or through the global form approach, the USPTO generally receives
 it within seconds after filing.  TEAS almost immediately displays a “Success” page that
 confirms receipt.  This page is evidence of filing should any question arise as to the
 filing date of the document, and may be printed or copied-and-pasted into an electronic
 record for storage.  From the “Success” page, the filer can click on a link to a PDF
 receipt that includes a summary of the filed information and general processing
 information.  TEAS also separately sends an e-mail acknowledgement of receipt that
 includes the same information.  Electronic filing creates an automatic entry of receipt
 of this filing into the USPTO’s automated system, which helps to avoid improper
 abandonment or cancellation.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-5d60e27">Under 37 C.F.R. §2.195(a)(2), correspondence
 transmitted electronically using TEAS is considered filed on the date the USPTO receives
 the transmission, in Eastern Time, regardless of whether that date is a Saturday,
 Sunday, or Federal holiday within the District of Columbia.

</b> regarding specimens in electronically
 transmitted applications.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-8d60e46">Requests for recordation of assignments and other
 documents affecting title to an application or registration can be filed through the
 Electronic Trademark Assignment System (“ETAS”) on the USPTO website at 
<b>
<a href="http://etas.uspto.gov/" target="_blank">http://etas.uspto.gov</a>
</b>.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-9d60e52">The Electronic System for Trademark Trials and
 Appeals (“ESTTA”), at 
<b>
<a href="http://estta.uspto.gov/" target="_blank">http://estta.uspto.gov/</a>
</b>, can be used to file requests for
 extensions of time to oppose, notices of opposition, petitions to cancel, appeals,
 motions, briefs, notices of change of address, and other documents in Board
 proceedings.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-10d60e58">If a document transmitted through TEAS, ETAS, or
 ESTTA is due on a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday within the District of
 Columbia, the document will be considered timely if the USPTO receives the transmission
 on or before the following day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday
 within the District of Columbia.  37 C.F.R. §2.196;

</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1d8b8_29f" class="nobull">(a) Signature required.  Each piece
 of correspondence that requires a signature must bear:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1d99f_2df" class="nobull">(1) A handwritten signature
 personally signed in permanent ink by the person named as the
 signatory, or a true copy thereof; or
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1da66_17" class="nobull">(2) An electronic signature
 that meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section,
 personally entered by the person named as the signatory.  The
 Office will accept an electronic signature that meets the
 requirements of paragraph (c) of this section on correspondence
 filed on paper, by facsimile transmission (§2.195(c)), or
 through TEAS or ESTTA.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1daca_de" class="nobull">(b) Copy of original signature.  If
 a copy, such as a photocopy or facsimile copy of an original signature
 is filed, the filer should retain the original as evidence of
 authenticity.  If a question of authenticity arises, the Office may
 require submission of the original.
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1db14_1ac" class="nobull">(c) Requirements for electronic
 signature.  A person signing a document electronically
 must:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1dc95_35f" class="nobull">(1) Personally enter any
 combination of letters, numbers, spaces and/or punctuation marks
 that he or she has adopted as a signature, placed between two
 forward slash (“/”) symbols in the signature block on the
 electronic submission; or
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1dcbc_21f" class="nobull">(2) Sign the verified
 statement using some other form of electronic signature
 specified by the Director.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1dd05_3e6" class="nobull">(d) Signatory must be identified.
  The name of the person who signs a document in connection with a
 trademark application, registration, or proceeding before the Trademark
 Trial and Appeal Board must be set forth in printed or typed form
 immediately below or adjacent to the signature, or identified elsewhere
 in the filing (e.g., in a cover letter or other document that
 accompanies the filing).
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1dd8a_31a" class="nobull">(e) Proper person to sign.
  Documents filed in connection with a trademark application or
 registration must be signed by a proper person.  Unless otherwise
 specified by law, the following requirements apply:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1ddef_1c3" class="nobull">(1) Verification of facts.
  A verification in support of an application for registration,
 amendment to an application for registration, allegation of use
 under §2.76 or §2.88, request for extension of time to file a
 statement of use under §2.89, or an affidavit under section 8,
 12(c), 15, or 71 of the Trademark Act must be sworn to or
 supported by a declaration under §2.20, signed by the owner or a
 person properly authorized to sign on behalf of the owner.  A
 person who is properly authorized to verify facts on behalf of
 an owner is:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1de32_356" class="nobull">(i) A person with
 legal authority to bind the owner (e.g., a corporate
 officer or general partner of a
 partnership);
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1de4a_390" class="nobull">(ii) A person with
 firsthand knowledge of the facts and actual or implied
 authority to act on behalf of the owner;
 or
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1df7c_14e" class="nobull">(iii) An attorney as
 defined in §11.1 of this chapter who has an actual
 written or verbal power of attorney or an implied power
 of attorney from the owner.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1dfc1_21" class="nobull">(2) Responses, amendments
 to applications, requests for express abandonment, requests for
 reconsideration of final actions, and requests to divide.
  Responses to Office actions, amendments to applications,
 requests for express abandonment, requests for reconsideration
 of final actions, and requests to divide must be signed by the
 owner of the application or registration, someone with legal
 authority to bind the owner (e.g. a corporate officer or general
 partner of a partnership), or a practitioner qualified to
 practice under §11.14 of this chapter, in accordance with the
 following guidelines:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1dfe5_19a" class="nobull">(i) If the owner is
 represented by a practitioner qualified to practice
 before the Office under §11.14 of this chapter, the
 practitioner must sign, except where the owner is
 required to sign the correspondence; or
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e165_2cd" class="nobull">(ii) If the owner is
 not represented by a practitioner qualified to practice
 under §11.14 of this chapter, the individual owner or
 someone with legal authority to bind the owner (e.g., a
 corporate officer or general partner of a partnership)
 must sign.  In the case of joint owners who are not
 represented by a qualified practitioner, all must
 sign.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e1a6_204" class="nobull">(3) Powers of attorney and
 revocations of powers of attorney.  Powers of attorney and
 revocations of powers of attorney must be signed by the
 individual applicant, registrant or party to a proceeding
 pending before the Office, or by someone with legal authority to
 bind the applicant, registrant, or party (e.g., a corporate
 officer or general partner of a partnership).  In the case of
 joint applicants, registrants, or parties, all must sign.  Once
 the applicant, registrant or party has designated a qualified
 practitioner(s), the named practitioner may sign an associate
 power of attorney appointing another qualified practitioner(s)
 as an additional person(s) authorized to prosecute the
 application or registration.  If the applicant, registrant, or
 party revokes the original power of attorney, the revocation
 discharges any associate power signed by the practitioner whose
 power has been revoked.  If the practitioner who signed an
 associate power withdraws, the withdrawal discharges any
 associate power signed by the withdrawing practitioner upon
 acceptance of the request for withdrawal by the
 Office.
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e1cb_3ae" class="nobull">(4) Petitions to revive
 under §2.66.  A petition to revive under §2.66 must be signed by
 someone with firsthand knowledge of the facts regarding
 unintentional delay.
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e209_3be" class="nobull">(5) Petitions to Director
 under §2.146.  A petition to the Director under §2.146 must be
 signed by the petitioner, someone with legal authority to bind
 the petitioner (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of
 a partnership), or a practitioner qualified to practice under
 §11.14 of this chapter, in accordance with the following
 guidelines:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e225_3af" class="nobull">(i) If the
 petitioner is represented by a practitioner qualified to
 practice before the Office under §11.14 of this chapter,
 the practitioner must sign; or
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e23d_2c5" class="nobull">(ii) If the
 petitioner is not represented by a practitioner
 authorized to practice before the Office under §11.14 of
 this chapter, the individual petitioner or someone with
 legal authority to bind the petitioner (e.g., a
 corporate officer or general partner of a partnership)
 must sign.  In the case of joint petitioners, all must
 sign.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e3cc_11b" class="nobull">(6) Requests for
 correction, amendment or surrender of registrations.  A request
 for correction, amendment or surrender of a registration must be
 signed by the owner of the registration, someone with legal
 authority to bind the owner (e.g., a corporate officer or
 general partner of a partnership), or a practitioner qualified
 to practice before the Office under §11.14 of this chapter.  In
 the case of joint owners who are not represented by a qualified
 practitioner, all must sign.
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e432_3d3" class="nobull">(7) Renewal applications.
  A renewal application must be signed by the registrant or the
 registrant’s representative.
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e476_ed" class="nobull">(8) Designations and
 revocations of domestic representative.  A designation or
 revocation of a domestic representative must be signed by the
 applicant or registrant, someone with legal authority to bind
 the applicant or registrant (e.g., a corporate officer or
 general partner of a partnership), or a practitioner qualified
 to practice under §11.14 of this chapter.  In the case of joint
 applicants or registrants, all must sign.
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e491_2b6" class="nobull">(9) Requests to change
 correspondence address in an application or registration.  A
 notice of change of correspondence address in an application or
 registration must be signed by the applicant or registrant,
 someone with legal authority to bind the applicant or registrant
 (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership),
 or a practitioner qualified to practice under §11.14 of this
 chapter, in accordance with the following
 guidelines:
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e4d7_33c" class="nobull">(i) If the applicant
 or registrant is represented by a practitioner qualified
 to practice before the Office under §11.14 of this
 chapter, the practitioner must sign; or
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e4ed_2a0" class="nobull">(ii) If the
 applicant or registrant is not represented by a
 practitioner qualified to practice before the Office
 under §11.14, the individual applicant or registrant or
 someone with legal authority to bind the applicant or
 registrant (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner
 of a partnership) must sign.  In the case of joint
 applicants or joint registrants, all must
 sign.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e532_d2" class="nobull">(10) Cover letters.  A
 person transmitting paper documents to the Office may sign a
 cover letter or transmittal letter.  The Office neither requires
 cover letters nor questions the authority of a person who signs
 a communication that merely transmits paper
 documents.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e54b_23b" class="nobull">(f) Signature as certification.
  The presentation to the Office (whether by signing, filing, submitting,
 or later advocating) of any document by any person, whether a
 practitioner or non-practitioner, constitutes a certification under
 §11.18(b) of this chapter.  Violations of §11.18(b) of this chapter may
 jeopardize the validity of the application or registration, and may
 result in the imposition of sanctions under §11.18(c) of this chapter.
  Any practitioner violating §11.18(b) of this chapter may also be
 subject to disciplinary action.  
<i>See</i>§§10.23(c)(15)
 [old rule] and 11.18(d) of this chapter.
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e55f_3ad" class="nobull">(g) Separate copies for separate
 files.
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e5c5_99" class="nobull">(1) Since each file must be
 complete in itself, a separate copy of every document to be
 filed in connection with a trademark application, registration,
 or inter partes proceeding must be furnished for each file to
 which the document pertains, even though the contents of the
 documents filed in multiple files may be
 identical.
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e600_51" class="nobull">(2) Parties should not file
 duplicate copies of correspondence in a single application,
 registration, or proceeding file, unless the Office requires the
 filing of duplicate copies.  The Office may dispose of duplicate
 copies of correspondence.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e624_3c6" class="nobull">(h) Separate documents for separate
 branches of the Office.  Since different branches or sections of the
 Office may consider different matters, each distinct subject, inquiry or
 order must be contained in a separate document to avoid confusion and
 delay in answering correspondence.
</li>
<li id="ch300_d1d6b5_1e65c_37e" class="nobull">(i) Certified documents required by
 statute.  When a statute requires that a document be certified, a copy

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-4d60e870">The identifying data on the postcard
 should be complete and specific.  The nature of the document being filed (e.g.,
 application, affidavit, amendment, appeal, petition); the name of the applicant
 or registrant; the mark; the application filing date or registration date; and
 the application serial number, registration number, or proceeding number should
 be included if available.  Each specific element of the filing should be listed

 the postcard can be used as evidence that the element was submitted if it is

 postcard because the application has not yet been serialized.  Therefore, if
 application documents are hand carried, the applicant may submit a second
 postcard with proper postage so that, upon serialization, the USPTO may send the

 postcard (

<b>
<a href="tmep-0300.html#TMEP-300d1e279">TMEP §303.02(c))</a>
</b> is
 responsible for placing proper postage on the self-addressed postcard.
  Proper postage means that it has a stamp(s) in the correct amount or a
 meter stamp postmark that complies with USPS requirements.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-4d60e903">The USPS provides in its Domestic
 Mail Manual that the date in a meter postmark must be the actual date of
 deposit, with limited exceptions, and that meter postmarks used to prepay
 reply postage must 
<i>not</i> show the date.  The USPS will not
 accept for mailing a post card that contains a postage meter date more than
 ten days old.  Thus, a return receipt postcard containing a dated meter
 postmark may not be delivered by the USPS, because the postcard will be
 mailed by the Office substantially after the date on which the meter
 postmark is printed on the card.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-5d60e906">Therefore, to ensure the receipt of a
 confirmation post card, the party filing the postcard should:  (1) affix
 postage stamps to their postcards, or purchase already-stamped post cards
 from the USPS; or (2) if a postage meter is used, ensure that the meter
 postmark does not show the date, and follow the instructions in the postage
 meter license agreement regarding prepay reply postage.

<b>
<a href="tmep-0300.html#TMEP-300d1e463">TMEP §305.01</a>
</b> for mailing

<p id="TMEP-ch-300-3d60e1648">The certificate of mailing must:  (1)
 state the date of deposit in the mail, which must be a date within the set
 filing period (this includes the last day of the period, or the succeeding day
 that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday within the District of
 Columbia when the last day of the period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal
 holiday within the District of Columbia); and (2) be signed by a person who has
 a reasonable basis to expect the correspondence to be deposited in the mail on
 the date indicated.  The signature of the certificate must be separate from any
 signature for the correspondence being deposited.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-4d60e1651">The best location for the certificate of
 mailing is at the beginning of the correspondence to which it pertains, typed in
 its entirety.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-5d60e1654">The certificate of mailing should be
 separated from contents of the correspondence that are on the same page.
  Several blank lines between the contents and the certificate will
 suffice.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-6d60e1658">If the certificate of mailing does not
 fit on the correspondence to which it pertains, the certificate may be placed on
 a separate sheet of paper that is attached securely to the correspondence.  The
 separate sheet must exhibit or bear a complete identification of the nature of
 the document or fee as well as an identification of the application,
 registration, and/or proceeding to which the document pertains (including serial
 number or registration number).  The separate sheet may be a cover letter or
 transmittal letter, with the certificate placed at the bottom of the letter and
 signed separately from the letter.  If there is any doubt concerning the
 correspondence to which a certificate of mailing on a separate sheet relates,
 the USPTO will not accept the certificate.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-7d60e1661">There must be a certificate of mailing
 for each piece of correspondence.  When correspondence for more than one
 application or registration is mailed in a single envelope, each item of
 correspondence must have its own certificate of mailing.  Similarly, when more
 than one type of correspondence is submitted in connection with the same
 application, each item of correspondence must have its own certificate of
 mailing.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-8d60e1664">It is suggested that the certificate be
 signed by the applicant or the party involved in the proceeding, or by the
 attorney for such person.  If someone else signs, it should be a responsible
 person in a position to know that the mail will be deposited on the date
 specified.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-9d60e1667">The USPTO accepts the date of deposit
 stated in the certificate of mailing on the basis of the statement of personal
 knowledge.  The USPTO does not normally inspect the postmark on the
 envelope.

 correspondence is the date of actual receipt in the USPTO.  37 C.F.R. §2.195(a).
  The USPTO does not retain the envelopes in which material is received or record
 the date of the postmark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-4d60e1723">The date of deposit indicated on the
 certificate of mailing is used only to determine whether the correspondence was
 deposited with the USPS within the filing period.  Therefore, if the
 correspondence is actually received in the USPTO within the filing period, the
 certificate of mailing is ignored.  If, however, the USPTO receives the
 correspondence after the filing period has expired, the USPTO looks to see
 whether a certificate of mailing was included.  If no certificate is found, the
 correspondence is untimely.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-5d60e1726">When a document received after the
 expiration of the filing period includes a signed certificate of mailing, and
 the date of deposit on the certificate is within the filing period, the USPTO
 considers the correspondence to be timely filed.

<p id="TMEP-ch-300-6d60e1730">If the filing period ends on a Saturday,
 Sunday, or Federal holiday within the District of Columbia, the correspondence

</b>), the certificate of mailing procedure
 of 37 C.F.R. §2.197 may be used for documents sent by “Express Mail” as well as
 documents sent by first class mail.  Under the certificate of mailing procedure,
 correspondence is considered to be timely filed even if received after the due date,
 if the correspondence is deposited with the USPS with sufficient postage as first
 class mail before the expiration of the filing period and accompanied by a
 certificate attesting to the date of deposit.  Correspondence sent by “Express Mail”
 is deemed to meet the requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.197(a)(1)(i)(A) for postage as
 first class mail, because the postage for “Express Mail” exceeds the postage
 required for first class mail.  However, to use the certificate of mailing procedure
 for documents mailed by “Express Mail,” the filer must place a certificate attesting
 to the date of deposit and meeting the requirements of 37 CFR §2.197(a)(1)(ii) on
 the document prior to mailing.  See

   Effect of Filing by Fax
</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-3d60e2602">The filing date of correspondence received
 in the USPTO by fax, regardless of whether it contains a certificate of
 transmission, is the date that the complete transmission is received by a USPTO fax
 machine, unless the transmission is completed on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal
 holiday within the District of Columbia.  Correspondence for which transmission is
 completed on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday within the District of Columbia
 is given a filing date as of the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday,
 or Federal holiday within the District of Columbia.  37 C.F.R.
 §2.195(a)(3).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-4d60e2605">For example, a 20-minute fax transmission to
 the USPTO from California starting on a Friday at 8:45 p.m. Pacific Time would be
 completed at 9:05 p.m. Pacific Time.  The complete transmission would be received in
 the USPTO at approximately 12:05 a.m. Eastern Time on Saturday.  The filing date
 accorded to the correspondence is the date of the following business day, which in
 this case would be Monday (assuming that Monday is not a Federal holiday within the
 District of Columbia).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-5d60e2608">The phrase “complete transmission” means
 that the transmission was received in its entirety.  For example, if page one of a
 ten-page fax transmission is received in the USPTO at 11:55 p.m. on a Tuesday and
 page ten of that transmission is received at 12:05 a.m. Wednesday, the filing date
 accorded to that correspondence will be the date of that Wednesday (assuming that
 Wednesday is not a Federal holiday within the District of Columbia).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-6d60e2612">If the sender wants the correspondence to be
 considered timely filed as of the date that the transmission began, the
 correspondence must include a certificate of transmission under 37 C.F.R. §2.197(a).

 Office.  The application serial number or registration number should be entered as a
 part of the sender’s identification on a facsimile cover sheet.  37 C.F.R.
 §2.195(c).  Applicants should wait until an application serial number is assigned
 before filing any document related to a new application by fax.  
<i>See
 
</i>37 C.F.R. §2.194(a).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-4d60e2630">It is recommended that each transmission
 include a cover sheet that, in addition to stating the application serial number or
 registration number, specifies the mark, the number of pages being transmitted, and
 the name, address, fax number, and telephone number of the transmitting
 party.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-5d60e2633">Each facsimile-transmitted document must be
 legible.  The preferred size of the document being submitted is 8½ inches by 11
 inches, letter size or A4 paper.  Because equipment used by the Office cannot print
 a document larger than 8½ inches by 11 inches, correspondence should not be
 transmitted on larger paper.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-6d60e2637">When correspondence is filed by facsimile
 transmission, it is recommended that the sending facsimile machine generate a report
 confirming transmission for each transmission session.  This report should be
 retained by the applicant, along with the original correspondence, as evidence of
 content and date of transmission.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-7d60e2640">Unless specifically requested to do so by
 the Office, parties should

<b>
<a href="tmep-0300.html#TMEP-300d1e975">TMEP §306.03</a>
</b>, the filing date
 given to correspondence received by fax transmission is the date that the
 complete transmission is received by a USPTO fax machine, unless the
 transmission is completed on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday within the
 District of Columbia, in which case the filing date is the next succeeding day
 that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday within the District of
 Columbia.  
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-4d60e2881">The date of transmission on the
 certificate is used only to determine whether the correspondence was transmitted
 to the USPTO within the filing period.  Therefore, if the complete transmission
 is actually received in the USPTO within the filing period, the certificate of
 transmission is ignored.  If the transmission is completed after the expiration
 of the filing period, the USPTO looks at the correspondence to see if a
 certificate of transmission was included.  If no certificate is found, the
 correspondence is untimely.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-5d60e2884">If the correspondence includes a signed
 certificate of transmission, and the date of transmission on the certificate is
 within the filing period, the correspondence is considered to be
 timely.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-6d60e2888">For example, if a West Coast applicant
 transmitted correspondence by fax on the last day of the response period,
 beginning before 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time (midnight Eastern Time) but completed
 after 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time, the USPTO would give the correspondence a filing
 date as of the next business day, because that is the date on which the USPTO
 received the complete transmission.  However, if the practitioner affixed a
 certificate of transmission to the faxed correspondence indicating that the
 correspondence was being transmitted on the last day of the response period,
 then the correspondence would be considered timely filed, even though the
 transmission completed after 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time (midnight Eastern Time) was
 received in the USPTO the day after the deadline for response.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-300-7d60e2891">If the filing period ends on a Saturday,
 Sunday or Federal holiday within the District of Columbia, the correspondence
 will be considered to be timely if the date of transmission on the certificate
