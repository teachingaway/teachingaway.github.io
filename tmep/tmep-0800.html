<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-800d1e37">801.02(a)  Act of 1946, Principal Register</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e83">The primary provision for registration in the Trademark Act of 1946 is for registration on the Principal Register (15 U.S.C. §§1051 through 1072). When a mark has been registered on the Principal Register, the mark is entitled to all the rights provided by the Act. The advantages of owning a registration on the Principal Register include the following:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull"> Constructive notice to the public of the registrant’s claim of ownership of the mark (15 U.S.C. §1072);
</li>
<li class="nobull"> A legal presumption of the registrant’s ownership of the mark and the registrant’s exclusive right to use the mark nationwide on or in connection with the goods/services listed in the registration (15 U.S.C. §§1057(b) and 1115(a));
</li>
<li class="nobull"> A date of constructive use of the mark as of the filing date of the application (15 U.S.C. §1057(c); 

<a href="tmep-0200.html#TMEP-200d1e32">TMEP §201.02</a>); 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> The ability to bring an action concerning the mark in federal court (15 U.S.C. §1121);
</li>
<li class="nobull"> The ability to file the United States registration with the United States Customs Service to prevent importation of infringing foreign goods (15 U.S.C. §1124);
</li>
<li class="nobull"> The registrant’s exclusive right to use a mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services covered by the registration can become “incontestable,” subject to certain statutory defenses (15 U.S.C. §§1065 and 1115(b)); and
</li>
<li class="nobull"> The use of the United States registration as a basis to obtain registration in foreign countries.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e135">If the applicant seeks registration on the Principal Register, the application should state that registration is requested on the Principal Register. However, if the applicant does not specify a register, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) will presume that the applicant seeks registration on the Principal Register.
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-800d1e67">801.02(b)  Act of 1946, Supplemental Register</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e147">Certain marks that are not eligible for registration on the Principal Register, but are capable of distinguishing an applicant’s goods or services, may be registered on the Supplemental Register. Sections 23 through 28 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1091 through 1096, provide for registration on the Supplemental Register. This is a continuation of the register provided for in the Act of March 19, 1920. Marks registered on the Supplemental Register are excluded from receiving the advantages of certain sections of the Act of 1946. The excluded sections are listed in §26 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1094. <i>See Otter Products LLC v. BaseOneLabs LLC</i>, 105 USPQ2d 1252, 1256 (TTAB 2012) (finding that while ownership of a registration on the Supplemental Register established opposer’s standing to oppose registration of applicant's mark, it did not establish that opposer owned a proprietary interest in a mark).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e150">If the applicant seeks registration on the Supplemental Register, the application should state that registration is requested on the Supplemental Register. If no register is specified, the USPTO will presume that the applicant seeks registration on the Principal Register.
</p>

<i>et seq</i>. regarding examination procedure relating to the Supplemental Register.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e163">An applicant may not seek registration on both the Principal and the Supplemental Register in the same application. If an applicant requests registration on both the Principal and the Supplemental Register in the same application, the examining attorney must require that the applicant amend to specify only one register, or file a request to divide under 37 C.F.R. §2.87.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e166">A mark in an application under §66(a) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1141f(a), based on a request for extension of protection of an international registration to the United States, cannot be registered on the Supplemental Register. 15 U.S.C. §1141h(a)(4); 37 C.F.R. §§2.47(c) and 2.75(c).

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e302">The question of whether an application can be filed in the name of a minor depends on state law. If the minor can validly enter into binding legal obligations, and can sue or be sued, in the state in which he or she is domiciled, the application may be filed in the name of the minor. Otherwise, the application should be filed in the name of a parent or legal guardian, clearly setting forth his or her status as a parent or legal guardian. An example of the manner in which the applicant should be identified in such cases is:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-1d85e307">John Smith, United States citizen, (parent/legal guardian) of Mary Smith.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-9d85e311">If the record indicates that the named applicant is a minor, the examining attorney must inquire as to whether the person can validly enter into binding legal obligations under the law of the state in which he or she is domiciled. If the minor cannot enter into binding legal obligations, the examining attorney must require correction of the applicant-identifying information in the manner shown above, if necessary.

If the applicant wishes to indicate in the application that actual use of the mark is being made by a division of the applicant, the applicant may provide a statement that “the applicant, <i>through its division</i> [specify name of division], is using the mark in commerce.” This statement should not appear in conjunction with the listing of the applicant’s name, and will not be printed on the registration certificate.

<i>Common Regulations Under the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks and the Protocol Relating to That Agreement</i> (“Common Regs.”), Rule 9(4)(b)(i) (2008). The international application does not require this information, but when the information is included, the IB will forward the nationality of the applicant to the USPTO. In a §66(a) application, if the “Nationality of Applicant” field appears in the Trademark Image Capture and Retrieval System (“TICRS”) (which is available to the public through the Trademark Status and Document Retrieval (“TSDR”) portal on the USPTO website at 

<a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/" target="_blank">http://tsdr.uspto.gov/</a>), this means that the applicant is an individual rather than a juristic entity, and that applicant’s citizenship is the country corresponding to the two-letter code set forth in this field. The list of country codes appears in the MM2 International Registration application form at 

<a href="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/madrid/en/forms/docs/form_mm2.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/madrid/en/forms/docs/form_mm2.pdf</a>. A separate statement that applicant is an individual will not appear in TICRS, and the “Legal Nature” and "Legal Nature: Place Incorporated" fields will state “Not Provided.”
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e476">If the “Nationality of Applicant” field appears in TICRS, the examining attorney may enter the relevant information into the Trademark database, or ask the LIE to enter it. No inquiry as to the applicant’s entity or citizenship is necessary. If the “Nationality of Applicant” field does not appear in TICRS, the examining attorney must require that the applicant indicate its entity and citizenship. Examining attorneys cannot rely on the “Entitlement Nationality,” “Entitlement Establishment,” or “Entitlement Domiciled” fields for the applicant’s citizenship because these fields merely indicate the basis for the applicant’s entitlement to file an application through the Madrid system, not the national citizenship of the individual applicant.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e480">
<i>Sole Proprietorship</i>. An applicant may identify itself as a sole proprietorship. If an applicant does so, the applicant must also indicate the state where the sole proprietorship is organized, in addition to the name and national citizenship of the sole proprietor.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e483">If the application specifically identifies the applicant as a sole proprietorship and indicates the state of organization of the sole proprietorship and the name and citizenship of the sole proprietor, the USPTO will accept the characterization of the entity. On the other hand, if the application refers to a sole proprietorship but lacks some of the necessary information or is ambiguous as to whether the applicant should be identified as a sole proprietorship or as an individual, the examining attorney must require appropriate clarification of the entity type.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e486">A sole proprietorship generally means a business which has only one owner. Therefore, if an application identifies two persons or two different entities as a “sole proprietorship,” this is an ambiguity that requires clarification of the entity type. Note, however, that in California a husband and wife can be classified as a sole proprietorship.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e498">After setting forth the applicant’s name and entity, the application of a partnership or a joint venture should specify the state or country under whose laws the partnership or joint venture is organized. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(ii). In addition, domestic partnerships must set forth the names, legal entities, and national citizenship (for individuals), or state or country of organization (for businesses), of all general partners or active members that compose the partnership or joint venture. 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(3)(iii) and (iv). These requirements apply to both general and limited partnerships. They also apply to a partnership that is a general partner in a larger partnership. Limited partners or silent or inactive partners need not be listed. The following format should be used:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-1d85e503">“_____________________, a (partnership, joint venture) organized under the laws of _______________, composed of ______________ (name, legal entity, and citizenship of individual partner; or name, legal entity, and state or country of incorporation or organization of juristic partner).”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e507">In the case of a domestic partnership consisting of ten or more general partners, if the partnership agreement provides for the continuing existence of the partnership in the event of the addition or departure of specific partners, the USPTO will require that the applicant provide the names, legal entities, and national citizenship (or the state or country of organization) of the principal partners only. If there are more than ten principal partners, the applicant need list only the first ten principal partners. If there is no class of principal partners, the applicant may list any ten general partners.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e511">Upon the death or dissolution of a partner or other change in the members that compose a domestic partnership, that legal entity ceases to exist and any subsequent arrangement constitutes a new entity, unless the partnership agreement provides for continuation of the partnership in the event of changes in partners. This same principle also applies to joint ventures. See <a href="tmep-0500.html#TMEP-500d1e1">TMEP Chapter 500</a>
 regarding changes of ownership.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e514">The rule requiring names and citizenships of general partners seeks to provide relevant information in the record, given the legal effects of partnership status in the United States. Because the USPTO does not track the varying legal effects of partnership status in foreign countries, and the relevance of the additional information has not been established, the same requirement for additional information does not apply to foreign partnerships.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e517">The term “firm” is not an acceptable designation of the applicant’s entity, because it does not have a universally understood meaning. The examining attorney must require a definite term such as “partnership” or “joint venture” when it is necessary to identify these entities.

<i>Corporation.</i> In the United States, the term “corporation” is proper for juristic entities incorporated under the laws of the various states or under special federal statutes. In addition to specifying that an applicant is a corporation, the application must specify the applicant’s state (for United States corporations) or country of incorporation (for foreign corporations). It is customary to follow the applicant’s name by the words “a corporation of the state (or country) of . . . .” This also applies to a nonprofit or tax-exempt corporation. If no state or country of incorporation, or the incorrect state or country of incorporation, is given for an applicant corporation, this defect may be corrected by amendment. The amendment does not have to be verified. If a corporation exists by virtue of a specific state or federal statute, this should be stated.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e538">
<i>Association</i>. “Association” and “nonprofit association” are acceptable terms to identify juristic entities organized under state laws or federal statutes that govern this form of organization. A domestic association must specify the state under whose laws the applicant is organized or exists, and indicate whether the association is incorporated or unincorporated. A foreign association must specify the country under whose laws the applicant is organized or exists and indicate whether the association is incorporated or unincorporated, unless the country and the designation or description “association/associazione” appear in Appendix D. This also applies to a domestic or foreign nonprofit or tax-exempt association. If an association exists by virtue of a specific state or federal statute, this should be stated. Verification is not required.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e541">
<i>Company</i>. The term “company” is indefinite for describing a United States entity because it does not identify a particular juristic entity, but is acceptable to identify entities organized under the laws of foreign countries that are equivalent or analogous to United States corporations or associations.

The terms “joint applicant(s)" or “joint owner(s)” reflects the relationship of multiple applicants as to a particular mark, but does not identify a particular type of legal entity in the United States.

If, however, the legal entity is set out as “joint applicant(s)” or “joint owner(s),” the examining attorney must require each applicant to clarify the nature of its legal entity as an individual or juristic person.

Many states have codified laws recognizing and regulating business trusts; other states apply common law. The USPTO will accept the entity designation “business trust,” or any appropriate variation provided for under relevant state law.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e635">The business trust is created under the instructions of the instrument of trust. Generally, the “trustee” has authority equivalent to an officer in a corporation. Laws vary to some extent as to the authority conferred on various individuals associated with the business trust.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e638">The application must first refer to the trustee(s) as the applicant and indicate the name of the trust, if any. The state under whose laws the trust exists, and the names and citizenship (or state of incorporation or organization) of the individual trustees, must also be set forth. Accordingly, the examining attorney should require that the business trust's application be captioned as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-1d85e644">The Trustees of the DDT Trust, a California business trust, the trustees comprising Sue Smith, a United States citizen, and the PDQ Corporation, a Delaware corporation.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e771">In designating the legal entity of foreign applicants, acceptable terminology is not always the same as for United States applicants. The word “corporation” as used in the United States is not necessarily equivalent to juristic entities of foreign countries; the word “company” is sometimes more accurate. If the applicant is from the United Kingdom or another commonwealth country (e.g., Canada or Australia) and the term “company” (or the abbreviation “co.”) is used, no inquiry is needed. “Limited company” is also acceptable in China and in commonwealth countries. There is a list of commonwealth countries on the commonwealth website at 

<a href="http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/142227/members/" target="_blank">http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/142227/members/</a>. In any other case, when the term “company” is used, the examining attorney must clarify what type of entity is applying.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e777">“Limited corporation” is also an acceptable entity designation for a foreign applicant.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e787">

<a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/appendix_d.htm" target="_blank">Appendix D</a>
 of this manual lists common foreign designations, and their abbreviations, used by various foreign countries to identify legal commercial entities. The appendix also includes a description (Joint Stock Company, Cooperative Society, Trading Partnership, etc.) of the foreign designation and, in some cases, the equivalent United States entity. If a foreign designation, its abbreviation, or a description appears in the appendix, the examining attorney may accept any of those terms as the entity designation without further inquiry. The applicant may also choose to specify the legal entity by indicating the entity that would be its equivalent in the United States. However, if an applicant identifies itself by a name that includes a foreign entity designation in Appendix D (e.g., “Business SpA”), but provides a characterization of the entity that does not match the description (e.g., General Partnership), the examining attorney must clarify the nature of the applicant’s entity. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e792">If a foreign entity designation, its abbreviation, or its description does not appear in 

<a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/appendix_d.htm" target="_blank">Appendix D</a>
, the examining attorney must inquire further into the specific nature of the entity. The examining attorney may request a description of the nature of the foreign entity, if necessary.
</p>
<p id="ch800_d1b1a1_1c276">The applicant must also specify the foreign country under whose laws it is organized, but no additional information is required, even if additional information would be required for a United States entity of the same name. For example, it is not necessary to set forth the names and citizenship of the partners of a foreign partnership. The rule requiring names and citizenships of general partners (37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(3)(iii)) seeks to provide relevant information in the record, given the legal effects of partnership status in the United States. Because the USPTO does not track the varying legal effects of partnership status in foreign countries, and the relevance of the additional information has not been established, the same requirement for additional information does not apply to foreign partnerships.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-9d85e798">Foreign entities may be organized under either national or provincial laws. However, the TEAS form requires an applicant to specify the state or foreign country under which it is legally organized, but does not permit an applicant to specify a foreign province or geographical region in this field. Therefore, if the applicant is organized under the laws of a foreign province or geographical region, the applicant should select as the entity type the choice of “Other,” which will allow entry within the free-text field provided at “Specify Entity Type” of both the type of entity and the foreign province or geographical region under which it is organized (e.g., “corporation of Ontario”). In the next section, “State or Country Where Legally Organized,” the country (e.g., “Canada”) should then be selected from the pull-down menu.

An LLP is separate and distinct from a limited partnership, and is more closely associated with a limited liability company in that it has attributes of both a corporation and a partnership. Therefore, the USPTO will accept the entity designation “limited liability partnership.” The examining attorney may accept appropriate variations of this entity (e.g., "limited liability limited partnership” or “LLLP”), with proof that the entity exists under the law of the relevant state.

If ambiguous terms are used, the examining attorney must require the applicant to clarify the record by setting forth the citizenship with greater specificity. For example, the term “American” is ambiguous because it could refer to a citizen of North, South, or Central America. Therefore, “United States” or “U.S.A.” is the appropriate citizenship designation for applicants who are citizens of the United States of America. However, terms such as “Brazilian,” Colombian,” and “Welsh” are acceptable citizenship designations because each refers to a specific country.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e855">An individual applicant should set forth the country of which he or she is a citizen. Current citizenship information must be provided; a statement indicating that the applicant has applied for citizenship in any country is not relevant or acceptable. If an individual is not a citizen of any country, a statement to this effect is acceptable.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e858">In an application for international registration, if the applicant is a natural person, he or she must indicate his or her name and may include the country of which he or she is a national. Common Regs, Rule 9(4)(b)(i). The international application does not require this information, but when the information is included, the IB will forward the nationality of the applicant to the USPTO. In a §66(a) application, if the “Nationality of Applicant” field appears in TICRS, this means that the applicant is an individual rather than a juristic entity, and that applicant’s citizenship is the country corresponding to the two-letter code set forth in this field. The list of country codes appears in the MM2 International Registration application form, which can be found at 

<a href="http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/appguide/" target="_blank">http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/appguide/</a>. A separate statement that applicant is an individual will not appear in TICRS, and the “Legal Nature” and Legal Nature: Place Incorporated” fields will state “Not Provided.”
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e862">If the “Nationality of Applicant” field appears in TICRS, the examining attorney may enter the relevant information into the Trademark database, or ask the LIE to enter it. No inquiry as to the applicant’s entity or citizenship is necessary. If the “Nationality of Applicant” field does not appear in TICRS, the examining attorney must require that the applicant indicate its entity and citizenship. Examining attorneys cannot rely on the “Entitlement Nationality,” “Entitlement Establishment,” or “Entitlement Domiciled” fields for the applicant’s citizenship because these fields merely indicate the basis for the applicant’s entitlement to file an application through the Madrid system, not the national citizenship of the individual applicant.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e865">If an applicant asserts dual citizenship, the applicant must choose which citizenship will be printed in the <i>Official Gazette</i> and on the registration certificate.

<i>Truth of Facts Recited</i>. Under 15 U.S.C. §§1051(a)(3)(B) and 1051(b)(3)(C), the verification of an application for registration must include an allegation that “to the best of the verifier’s knowledge and belief, the facts recited in the application are accurate.” 37 C.F.R. §§2.33(b)(1) and (2). The language in 37 C.F.R. §2.20 that “all statements made of [the verifier’s] own knowledge are true, and all statements made on information and belief are believed to be true” satisfies this requirement.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e1218">
<i>Use in Commerce</i>. If the filing basis is §1(a), the applicant must submit a verified statement that the mark is in use in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services listed in the application. If the verification is not filed with the original application, the verified statement must also allege that the mark was in use in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services listed in the application <i>as of the application filing date</i>. 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(1)(i).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e1222">
<i>Bona Fide Intention to Use in Commerce</i>. If the filing basis is §1(b), §44(d), or §44(e), the applicant must submit a verified statement that the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services listed in the application. 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b)(3)(B), 1126(d)(2), and 1126(e). If the verification is not filed with the original application, the verified statement must also allege that the applicant has had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services listed in the application <i>as of the application filing date</i>. 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(2), 2.34(a)(3)(i), and 2.34(a)(4)(ii).

Re-execution is also required where an allegation of use (i.e., either an amendment to allege use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(c) or a statement of use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(d)) or request for extensions of time to file a statement of use is not filed within a reasonable time after the date of execution. 37 C.F.R. §§2.76(i), 2.88(k), and 2.89(h);

No new verification should be required if the document is filed within one year of execution. If an application, allegation of use, or request for extension of time to file a statement of use is filed more than one year after its execution, the examining attorney will require that the applicant submit re-executed documents, or a statement that is verified or includes a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20, of the applicant’s continued use or bona fide intent to use the mark in commerce, as appropriate.

<i>Documents Cannot Be Filed Before They Are Executed</i>

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e1278">If an applicant files an application that is signed and lists a date of execution that is subsequent to the application filing date, the examining attorney will inquire as to the actual date on which the application was signed. However, where an application is executed in a foreign country located across the international date line, the fact that an application shows a date of execution as of the day after the application filing date is not inconsistent with its having been executed before filing. No inquiry is required in this limited situation.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e1722">Section 66(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1141f(a), provides for a request for extension of protection of an international registration to the United States. 
<i>See</i>37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(5). The request must include a declaration of a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce that is verified by the applicant for, or holder of, the international registration. The verified statement is part of the international registration on file at the IB. 37 C.F.R. §2.33(e). The IB will have established that the international registration includes this declaration before it sends the request for extension of protection to the USPTO. Generally, the examining attorney need not review the international registration to determine whether there is a proper declaration of intent to use, or issue any inquiry regarding the initial verification of the application. However, if the applicant voluntarily files a substitute declaration with the USPTO, it will be examined according to the same standards used for examining any other declaration.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e1734">Section 66(a) requires transmission of a request for extension of protection by the IB to the USPTO. It cannot be added or substituted as a basis in an application originally filed under §1 or §44.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e1738">Under 15 U.S.C. §1141g and Madrid Protocol Article 4(2), the §66(a) applicant may claim a right of priority within the meaning of Article 4 of the Paris Convention if:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull">(1) The request for extension of protection contains a claim of priority;
</li>
<li class="nobull">(2) The request for extension of protection specifies the filing date, serial number, and the country of the application that forms the basis for the claim of priority; <i>and</i>

The applicant must clearly indicate that more than one basis is claimed, and must separately list each basis, followed by the goods or services to which that basis applies. If some or all of the goods or services are covered by more than one basis, this must be stated. 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(b)(2) and 2.35(b)(6).

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e2504">If an applicant properly claims §44(d) in addition to another basis, the applicant may elect not to perfect a §44(e) basis and still retain the §44(d) priority filing date. 37 C.F.R. §§2.35(b)(3) and (4);

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e2516">Sometimes, a §44(d) applicant who elects not to perfect a §44(e) basis will file an amendment “deleting” the §44 basis. In this situation, the USPTO will presume that the applicant wants to retain the priority claim, unless the applicant specifically states that it wants to delete the priority claim and instead rely on the actual filing date of the application in the United States.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e2520">If the applicant is not entitled to priority (e.g., because the United States application was not filed within six months of the foreign filing), the examining attorney should ensure that the priority claim is deleted from the Trademark database, and should conduct a new search of USPTO records for conflicting marks.

<i>In re L.G. Lavorazioni Grafite S.r.l.,</i> 61 USPQ2d 1063 (Dir USPTO 2001). Similarly, if an applicant enters a standard character mark, or attaches a digitized image of a mark, in the “Mark” field of a TEAS application, and a different mark appears in another field, the application will receive a filing date, and the mark entered in the “Mark” field will control for purposes of determining what the mark is.

If the applicant submits an application where the “drawing” is composed of multiple elements on a separate page, multiple elements on a single digitized image, or multiple elements in a separate area of the body of the application, the applicant has met the requirement of 37 C.F.R. §2.21(a)(3) for a clear drawing of the mark.

 of this manual lists countries that register marks in standard characters or the equivalent. For countries on this list, if all letters and words in the mark are in block capital or capital and lowercase Latin characters, all numerals are Roman or Arabic numerals, the mark includes only common punctuation or diacritical marks, and no stylization of lettering and/or numbers is claimed, the examining attorney need not inquire whether the registered mark in the foreign registration is in standard characters or the equivalent, unless the applicant has indicated that the mark is <i>not</i> standard characters or the equivalent. If the applicant has indicated that the mark is <i>not</i> in standard characters or the equivalent, but the foreign registration is from a country on the list and the mark meets the standards set forth above, the examining attorney must inquire about the discrepancy. In response to the inquiry, the applicant must either amend the application to claim standard characters, or confirm that the mark is not in standard characters or the equivalent.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e3095">A special form drawing is required if words, letters, or numerals are presented in a distinctive form that engenders an uncommon or “special” commercial impression that would be altered or lost were registration to issue based on a standard character drawing. 
<i>In re Morton Norwich Prods., Inc.</i>, 221 USPQ 1023, 1023 (TTAB 1983) (holding LABID not registrable without a special form drawing because the specimen showed the letter “a” in smaller lettering with a diacritical accent that set off the “BID” portion of the mark, when the word “BID” had an accepted meaning as applied to drug prescriptions, i.e., “twice a day”); <i>see</i> <i>In re United Servs. Life Ins. Co.</i>, 181 USPQ 655, 656 (TTAB 1973) (holding FOR LIFE INSURANCE SEE US not registrable without a special form drawing because the specimen showed the “US” portion of the mark in significantly larger lettering and underlined, suggesting a double entendre because “US” could stand for applicant’s name “United Services” or for the pronoun “us”); <i>In re Dartmouth Mktg. Co.</i>, 154 USPQ 557, 558 (TTAB 1967) (finding “luncheon time” presented “in an uncommon manner to the extent that a prospective purchaser’s initial impression of the mark might well be other than that which applicant may intend to convey by the well understood term ‘luncheon time’”) .
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e3098">A special form drawing is required for marks that contain superscripts, subscripts, exponents, or other characters that are not in the USPTO’s standard character set.

 regarding the USPTO’s standard character set.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e3104">The USPTO encourages the use of standard character drawings. As a general rule, an applicant may submit a standard character drawing when a word, letter, numeral, or combination thereof creates a distinct commercial impression apart from any stylization or design element appearing on the specimen. If a mark remains the same in essence and is recognizable regardless of the form or manner of display that is presented, displaying the mark in standard character format affords a quick and efficient way of showing the essence of the mark. 
<i>In re wTe Corp.</i>, 87 USPQ2d 1536, 1539-40 (TTAB 2008) (reversing refusal on the ground that the standard character mark on the drawing was not a substantially exact representation of the mark as actually used, finding that SPECTRAMET creates a distinct commercial impression apart from any stylization or design element appearing on the specimens, on which the letter “C” was displayed with an arrow design); <i>see In re Oroweat Baking Co.</i>, 171 USPQ 168 (TTAB 1971) (holding requirement for special form drawing to register OROWEAT displayed with wheat designs in the letter “O” improper); <i>In re Elec.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e3108">When an application is for a mark in standard characters, the examining attorney must consider the manner in which the mark is used on the specimen, and decide whether the mark includes an essential element or feature that cannot be produced by the use of standard characters.

If scanning from a paper image of the mark, it may be necessary to cut out the mark and scan it with little or no surrounding white space. Failure to do this may cause the mark to appear very small in the USPTO’s automated records, such that it may be difficult to recognize all words or design features of the mark. To ensure that there is a clear image of the mark in the automated records of the USPTO, examining attorneys and LIEs should view the mark on the Publication Review program available on the USPTO’s internal computer network.

If the mark is too long to meet this requirement, applicant must submit an image on which the mark is broken in an appropriate place. It is suggested that the applicant use 14-point type to ensure that the mark will be legible in the <i>Official Gazette</i> and on the certificate of registration.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e3358">If an applicant submits an image on which the mark exceeds the size requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.54(b), the USPTO will reduce the image so that it will meet these requirements. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1422">TMEP §807.06(a)</a>. This could cause the mark to appear very small. To ensure that the mark will be legible in the <i>Official Gazette</i> and on the certificate of registration, the examining attorney should view the mark on the Publication Review program available on the USPTO’s internal computer network. If the mark is not legible, the examining attorney must require a new drawing that meets the requirements of 37 C.F.R. §§2.52 and 2.54.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-800d1e1457">807.06(c)  Separate Drawing Page Preferred</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e3373">The USPTO recommends that an applicant submit a drawing of the mark on a separate page from the written application. 37 C.F.R. §2.54(a). However, a separate drawing page is not mandatory. Instead of a drawing page, an applicant may include a drawing of the mark embedded in the application, in either the heading or the body of the application.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e3376">If the applicant identifies a separate page as a drawing (e.g., by labeling it as a drawing, or providing a heading with the applicant’s name, address and the subject goods/services), this will be the only drawing considered.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e3379">A mark depicted on the specimen or in the foreign registration certificate will not be considered a drawing.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e3383">If there is no separate drawing page, the examining attorney must review the application to determine what the mark is. If an embedded drawing meets the requirements of 37 C.F.R. §§2.51, 2.52, and 2.54, the examining attorney should accept it and not require a substitute drawing.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e3386">Effective October 30, 1999, a separate drawing page is considered part of the written application, not a separate element. Dates of use, disclaimers, descriptions of the mark, identifications of goods/services, and other information that appears on the drawing are also considered part of the written application. This applies to substitute drawings as well as original drawings. If there is an inconsistency between the information on the drawing page and the information in the body of the application, the examining attorney must require clarification.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e3389">If an applicant submits a separate drawing page showing a mark, and a different mark appears in the written application, the drawing page controls for purposes of determining what the mark is.

If the color claim is unclear or ambiguous, the examining attorney must require clarification. If the color claim or mark description references changeable colors, the examining attorney must require an amended mark description that deletes the reference to the color in the mark varying or being changeable and restricts the description to only those colors shown on the drawing. <i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1124">TMEP §807.01</a>.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e4050">If a drawing contains punctuation, the elements of punctuation are presumed to be part of the mark. Thus, if there is punctuation in the mark on the drawing, the punctuation must also appear on the specimen or the drawing is not considered to be a substantially exact representation of the mark as used in commerce. If deletion of the punctuation from the drawing does not alter the commercial impression, the drawing may be amended to match the specimen. If deletion of the punctuation changes the commercial impression, i.e., constitutes a material alteration, the applicant must submit a substitute specimen to match the original drawing.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e4056">For example, if the mark on the drawing is “ALL THE KING’S MEN,” and the mark on the specimen is ALL THE KING’S MEN, the mark on the drawing is not a substantially exact representation of the mark as used in commerce. Since the deletion of the quotation marks from the drawing would not change the commercial impression of the mark, the drawing may be amended to match the specimen. The applicant has the option to either: (1) amend the drawing to delete the punctuation; or (2) submit a new specimen showing use of the mark with the punctuation.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e4059">However, if the mark on the drawing is GOT MILK?, and the mark on the specimen is GOT MILK, the deletion of the punctuation from the drawing would constitute a material alteration because it changes the commercial impression from a question to a statement. Therefore, the drawing may not be amended and the applicant must submit a substitute specimen that includes punctuation in order for the drawing to be a substantially exact representation.

For example, if the mark on the drawing is HOME RUN, and the mark on the specimen is “HOME RUN,” the drawing is considered a substantially exact representation of the mark as used on the specimen. The quotation marks on the specimen are nondistinctive and do not change the commercial impression of the mark, so it is unnecessary to amend the drawing or require a substitute specimen.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e4080">However, in rare instances, the punctuation marks on the specimen result in a mark with a different commercial impression than the mark shown on the drawing. For example, if the mark on the specimen is PREGNANT?, and the mark on the drawing is PREGNANT, the mark on the drawing is not a substantially exact representation of the mark as actually used. The question mark on the specimen transforms the word PREGNANT from a mere statement to a question, and, therefore, changes the commercial impression of the mark. Moreover, the drawing cannot be amended to add the punctuation because it would result in a material alteration. Therefore, the applicant must submit a new specimen showing the mark without the punctuation. <i>In re Guitar Straps Online, LLC</i>, 103 USPQ2d 1745, 1751-52 (TTAB 2012) (finding the mark GOT STRAPS on the drawing not a substantially exact representation of the mark GOT STRAPS? on the specimen). <i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1885">TMEP §§807.14</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e4118">If the United States application has a color drawing, the same colors must be part of the mark in the foreign registration. Whether the drawing in the United States application can be amended depends upon whether the amendment would be a material alteration of the mark.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e4220">Like any other drawing, a drawing of a compound word mark or telescoped mark must be a substantially exact representation of the mark as it appears on the specimen in a §1 application or on the foreign registration in a §44 application.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e4223">A compound word mark is comprised of two or more distinct words, or words and syllables, that are represented as one word (e.g., BOOKCHOICE, PROSHOT, MAXIMACHINE, PULSAIR). Often, each word or syllable in a compound word mark is displayed or highlighted by: (1) capitalizing the first letter of each word or syllable (e.g., TimeMaster); or (2) presenting the words or syllables in a different color, script, or size (e.g., RIBtype).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e4226">If the drawing depicts the mark as a compound word mark, but the specimen shows the mark as two separate words, or vice versa, the examining attorney must determine whether the specimen is a substantially exact representation of the mark on the drawing and/or whether an amendment to the drawing would be a material alteration of the mark. 
<i>See</i> <i>In re Innovative Companies, LLC</i>, 88 USPQ2d 1095 (TTAB 2008) (FREEDOMSTONE not a substantially exact representation of FREEDOM STONE, but amendment of FREEDOMSTONE to FREEDOM STONE not deemed a material alteration). For example, if the drawing depicts the mark as BOOKCHOICE, but the specimen shows it as BOOK CHOICE, the mark on the specimen is not a substantially exact representation of the mark on the drawing. An amendment to the drawing would not be a material alteration. However, depending upon the nature of the goods/services, a disclaimer might be required. Note that a specimen showing the mark as BookChoice would be a substantially exact representation.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e4230">A telescoped mark is comprised of two or more words that share letters (e.g., SUPERINSE). A telescoped word must be presented as a unitary term with the letters shared. The telescoped element may not be represented as two words, because the shared letter is an aspect of the commercial impression, (e.g., SUPERINSE, not SUPE RINSE or SUPER RINSE).

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e4494">An applicant may request deletions from the mark on the drawing, and the examining attorney may approve the request if he or she believes the deletions are appropriate and would not materially alter the mark. 37 C.F.R. §2.72.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e4497">Deletion of matter from the mark can result in a material alteration. 
<i>See</i> <i>In re Dillard Department Stores, Inc.</i>, 33 USPQ2d 1052 (Comm’r Pats. 1993) (proposed deletion of highly stylized display features of mark “IN•VEST•MENTS” held to be a material alteration of a registered mark). However, nondistinctive matter may be deleted, if it does not constitute a material alteration. For example, the deletion of the generic name of the goods or services would not generally be considered a material alteration, unless it was so integrated into the mark that the deletion would alter the commercial impression. In some circumstances, nondistinctive matter may be deleted if the overall commercial impression is not altered. Also, deletions of matter determined to be unregistrable under §§2(a) or 2(b) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1052(a) or (b) (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e3042">TMEP §§1203</a>

See <i>In re Sazerac Co., Inc.</i>, 136 USPQ 607 (TTAB 1963) and cases cited therein.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e4510">The symbols “TM,” “SM,” and the registration notice ® must be deleted from the drawing.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e4513">Informational matter, such as net weight and volume statements, lists of contents, addresses, and similar matter, should also be deleted from the mark, unless it is truly part of a composite mark and the removal of this matter would alter the overall commercial impression. If unregistrable matter, including informational matter and the name of the goods, is incorporated in a composite mark in such a way that its removal would change the commercial impression of the mark or make it unlikely to be recognized, the matter may remain on the drawing and be disclaimed. See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e11900">TMEP §1213.03(b)</a>

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e4519">Functional matter that is part of an otherwise registrable trade dress mark may also be removed or deleted from the drawing by depicting that matter in broken or dotted lines. Since functionality is an absolute bar to registration on the Principal Register or the Supplemental Register, features of a trade dress mark that are deemed functional under trademark law are never capable of acquiring trademark significance and are not registrable. Therefore, such removal or deletion of the functional features generally will not be considered a material alteration of the mark, regardless of the filing basis of the application. See TMEP §§

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e4541">
<i>Addition</i>. An amendment adding an element that the applicant has previously registered for the same goods or services may be permitted. The rationale is that “[t]he addition of applicant’s well-known registered mark to the mark sought to be registered ... is not a material change which would require republication of the mark.” 
<i>Florasynth Laboratories Inc. v. Mülhens</i>, 122 USPQ 284 (Comm’r Pats. 1959) (addition of applicant’s previously registered mark “4711” to the mark “ELAN” held not a material alteration). However, the addition of matter that the applicant has previously registered for <i>different</i> goods or services is not permissible. <i> In re Hacot-Colombier</i>, 105 F.3d 616, 620, 41 USPQ2d 1523, 1526 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <i>In re Nationwide Industries Inc.</i>, 6 USPQ2d 1882, 1886 (TTAB 1988). An amendment adding previously registered matter is also unacceptable if it substantially alters the original mark. 
<i>In re John LaBatt Ltd.</i>, 26 USPQ2d 1077, 1078 (Comm’r Pats. 1992) (“Here, the applicant does not seek to merely add an element from one registration to another. Rather, the applicant seeks to eliminate its original mark, and substitute another. The exception to the material alteration rule clearly does not encompass cases where the original mark disappears.”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e4544">
<i>Deletion</i>. The question of whether a proposed amendment to <i>delete</i> previously registered matter from a mark is a material alteration should be determined without regard to whether the matter to be deleted is the subject of an existing registration.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-800d1e1932">807.14(c)  Addition or Deletion of Punctuation</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e4556">Punctuation, such as quotation marks, hyphens, periods, commas, and exclamation marks generally does not significantly alter the commercial impression of the mark. See,
<i> e.g., In re Litehouse, Inc.</i>, 82 USPQ2d 1471 (TTAB 2007) and cases cited therein. 
<i>See also</i> <i>In re Promo Ink</i>, 78 USPQ2d 1301, 1305 (TTAB 2006) (the Board found the mark PARTY AT A DISCOUNT! to be merely descriptive, specifically noting that "[t]his punctuation mark does not significantly change the commercial impression of the mark. It would simply emphasize the descriptive nature of the mark to prospective purchasers...").
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e4559">However, punctuation may be incorporated into a mark in such a way that the commercial impression of the mark would be changed by the addition or deletion of such punctuation. 
<i>See</i> <i>In re Guitar Straps Online, LLC</i>, 103 USPQ2d 1745, 1748 (TTAB 2012) (finding “the proposed addition of a question mark to the mark ‘GOT STRAPS’ constitutes a material alteration because it changes the commercial impression of the original mark from a declaratory statement to an interrogative phrase”); <i>Richards-Wilcox Mfg. Co.,</i> 181 USPQ 735 (Comm’r Pats. 1974), <i>overruled on other grounds</i>, <i>In re Umax Data System, Inc.</i>, 40 USPQ2d 1539 (Comm'r Pats. 1996) (proposed change of FYE[R-W]ALL and design to FYER-WALL in block letters denied as material alteration, in part, because brackets changed commercial impression of mark as the initial letters of applicant’s name, “R” and “W,” were no longer emphasized). For example, unlike most cases where the addition of an exclamation point does not affect the commercial impression of a mark, the addition of an exclamation point to the mark MOVE IT transforms the words from a mere command to relocate an object to an exclamatory statement – MOVE IT! – often used to order a person out of the way, and, therefore, changes the commercial impression of the mark.

</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull"> the addition or deletion of a question mark, which changes a statement into a question or vice versa (<i>See</i> <i>In re Guitar Straps Online</i>, 103 USPQ2d at 1748);

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e4602">The USPTO will determine whether a proposed amendment materially alters a mark by comparing the proposed amendment with the description or drawing of the mark filed with the original application. 37 C.F.R. §§2.72(a)(2), 2.72(b)(2), and 2.72(c)(2).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e4605">Prior to October 30, 1999, in certain limited circumstances, the USPTO would accept an amendment that corrected an “internal inconsistency” in an application as originally filed, without regard to the issue of material alteration. Because 37 C.F.R. §§2.72(b), (c), and (d) did not expressly prohibit an amendment that materially altered the mark on the original drawing, the USPTO would accept an amendment to correct an “internal inconsistency,” even if the amendment materially altered the mark on the original drawing. An application was considered “internally inconsistent” if the mark on the original drawing did not agree with the mark on the specimen in an application based on use, or with the mark on the foreign registration in an application based on §44 of the Act. 
<i>See</i> <i>In re ECCS Inc.</i>, 94 F.3d 1578, 39 USPQ2d 2001 (Fed. Cir. 1996);
<i> In re Dekra e.V.</i>, 44 USPQ2d 1693 (TTAB 1997).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e4608">Effective October 30, 1999, 37 C.F.R. §2.72 was amended to prohibit amendments that materially alter the mark on the drawing filed with the original application. Furthermore, 37 C.F.R. §2.52 was amended to state that the “drawing depicts the mark sought to be registered.” Accordingly, the USPTO no longer accepts amendments to cure “internal inconsistencies,” if these amendments materially alter the mark on the original drawing. <i> In re Who? Vision Systems, Inc.</i>, 57 USPQ2d 1211 (TTAB 2000). 
<i>See also</i> <i>In re Tetrafluor Inc.</i>, 17 USPQ2d 1160 (Comm'r Pats. 1990) (examining attorney properly refused to accept amendment to “correct a typographical error” that materially altered mark on original drawing page).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e4612">If a paper application includes a separate drawing page showing a mark, and a different mark appears in the written application, the drawing controls for purposes of determining what the mark is.

<i>In re L.G. Lavorazioni Grafite S.r.l.</i>, 61 USPQ2d 1063 (Dir USPTO 2001). Similarly, if an applicant enters a standard character mark, or attaches a digitized image of a mark, in the “Mark” field on a TEAS application, and a different mark appears in another field, the mark entered in the “Mark” field will control for purposes of determining what the mark is. The applicant may not amend the mark if the amendment is a material alteration of the mark on the drawing.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e4621">For example, if the applicant submits a drawing page showing the word mark “ABC and design,” the applicant may not amend the application to delete the wording “and design,” and add a design feature to the letters “ABC.” However, the applicant may amend the drawing to “ABC.” <i> In re Meditech Int’l Corp.</i>, 25 USPQ2d 1159 (TTAB 1990) (mark comprised of a design of blue star found to be a material alteration of the typed words “DESIGN OF BLUE STAR”).

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e4636">Whenever a proposed color amendment is refused as a material alteration, the examining attorney must clearly explain why the proposed amendment changes the meaning or overall impression of the mark, or impacts the likelihood of confusion analysis.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e4650">If a mark is initially depicted in a black-and-white special form drawing in which no color is claimed, the drawing is presumed to contemplate the use of the mark in any color, without limitation.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-800d1e1984">807.14(e)(ii)  Marks that Include Color and Other Elements</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e4663">The extent to which color contributes to the commercial impression created by a mark is often determined by the type of mark in question (i.e., word mark, design mark, or trade dress). In some cases, color may play only an incidental or insignificant part in creating the commercial impression of a mark, such as the color lettering of a word mark. In other cases, color is the only feature of the mark that creates a commercial impression, such as where the mark consists only of color(s) applied to goods or their packaging, or to articles used in the sale or advertising services.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e4666">
<i>Word Marks</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e4669">In general, the addition, deletion, or amendment of color lettering in a word mark does not result in a material alteration of the mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e4673">Word marks may appear as stylized marks in color lettering. With the possible exception of generic wording, as discussed below, the literal portions of word marks are likely to be the dominant portions that create the greatest commercial impression. 
<i>Inter-State Oil Co., Inc. v. Questor Corp.</i>, 209 USPQ 583, 586 (TTAB 1980). In most cases, the color in the lettering is unlikely to have a significant impact on the commercial impression created by the mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e4676">
<i>Exception – Generic Terms.</i> Generic terms are incapable of functioning as marks denoting source, and are not registrable on the Principal Register under §2(f) or on the Supplemental Register. However, if the generic wording appears in color lettering, the color portion may be capable of functioning as a source indicator. See, e.g., <i>Courtenay Communications Corp., v. Hall</i>, 334 F.3d 210, 216, 67 USPQ2d 1210, 1214 (2nd Cir. 2003) and cases cited therein (“There are many examples of legally protected marks that combine generic wording with distinctive lettering, coloring, or other design elements.”). With respect to such generic word marks, the color element of the wording is likely to be the more dominant portion in creating the commercial impression of the mark. Therefore, in cases where the entire literal portion is generic, a proposed amendment to the color portion of the word mark generally would be a material alteration.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e4679">
<i>Design Marks</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-9d85e4682">In general, the addition, deletion, or amendment of color features in a design mark does not result in a material alteration of the mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-10d85e4685">In a color design mark, the design portion is likely to be the most dominant portion of the mark in creating a commercial impression. Although the color portion is part of the mark, it only appears in the context of the design and is not a separable element. The color portion is, therefore, less likely than the design portion to play a significant role in likelihood of confusion or trademark selection considerations. For example, the fact that two different designs, such as a red hat design and a red boat design, may appear in identical colors is unlikely to result in a finding of likelihood of confusion. In contrast, if two boat designs are identical in stylization, it is likely that the designs would be held to be confusingly similar regardless of any differences in their respective colors.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-11d85e4688">
<i>Exception - Color Impacts the Meaning or Significance of the Mark.</i> An amendment that causes the mark to have a new meaning or significance in the context of the goods or services is likely to be a material alteration. For example, the amendment of a blue colored drop for “spring water,” which looks like a rain drop, to a red drop, which looks like blood, would probably be a material alteration because the change in the color of the drop has altered the meaning or commercial impression of the mark. An amendment of a rainbow design, consisting of an arc with a spectrum of colors, to a black or solid-colored arc, would be a material alteration, regardless of the goods or services, because the amended mark is just an arc and is no longer identifiable as a rainbow.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-12d85e4692">
<i>Exception – Color is the Dominant Portion of the Mark</i>. Generally, if the color portion to be amended constitutes the dominant or most significant part of the entire mark, it becomes more likely that the proposed color amendment is a material alteration. For example, if the design mark consists solely of a common geometric shape, the color element is likely to be the dominant element of the mark. As a result, amending the color of a common geometric shape is likely to be a material alteration.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-13d85e4695">Another factor to consider in assessing the dominance of the color element of the mark is the size or prominence of the color design or graphic element to be amended in proportion to the rest of the mark. For example, if it is clear that the mark consists of the overall color scheme of a product’s trade dress, such as the product package or container, an amendment to a particular color element that is small or insignificant in proportion to the entire mark is unlikely to be a material alteration. Conversely, an amendment to a color element that is large in proportion to the entire mark, or is a dominant element of the overall color scheme, is more likely to be a material alteration. For example, if a mark consists solely of the color scheme or pattern of a package or container that is equally divided into two colors, amending one or both colors is more likely to be a material alteration.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e4707">The amendment of any color in a color mark is a prohibited material alteration.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e4710">Color marks are marks that consist solely of one or more colors used on particular objects or substances as a source identifier (as opposed to marks that include color in addition to other elements). 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e1975">TMEP §§1202.05</a>

<i>et seq</i>. Color marks generally appear in a drawing with the outline or configuration of the goods on which they appear to show the placement of the color mark. However, the shape or configuration of the goods is not part of the mark. The mark is comprised solely of the color as applied to the object or substance, in the manner depicted and described, so that changing or amending the color of the mark would always change the entire commercial impression created by the mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e4716">An amendment of the mark to show the same color on a different object is also generally a material alteration (e.g., an amendment of a drawing of a blue hammer to a blue saw). A color takes on the characteristics of the object to which it is applied, and the commercial impression of a color may change depending on the object to which it is applied.

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1488">TMEP §807.07(a)</a>.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e5033">See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e2188">TMEP §§808.03</a>

 regarding printing of lining and stippling statements and other descriptions of the mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e5042">
<i>Previous Practice</i>. Prior to October 30, 1999, an applicant who wanted to show color in a mark was required to use the USPTO’s color lining system. The color lining system required applicants to line their drawings using certain patterns designated for certain colors, and to provide a color lining statement describing where the colors appeared. The color lining system was deleted from the rule effective October 30, 1999; however, during a transitional period between October 30, 1999 and November 2, 2003, the USPTO continued to accept drawings that showed color by using this lining system. 
<i>See</i>notice at 

<a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=1999_register&amp;docid=99-22957-filed.pdf" target="_blank">64 Fed. Reg. 48900</a>
, 48903 (Sept. 8, 1999) and 1226 TMOG 103, 106 (Sept. 28, 1999). When an applicant submitted a drawing that included lining that was a feature of the mark and was not intended to indicate color, the applicant was required to submit a statement to that effect, so the record would be clear as to what applicant was claiming as the mark. Similarly, when an applicant submitted a drawing that included stippling for shading purposes, the applicant was required to submit a statement to that effect.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-800d1e2155">808.02  Description Must Be Accurate and Concise</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e5059">If a description of a mark is placed in the record, the description should state clearly and accurately what the mark comprises, and should not create a misleading impression by either positive statement or omission. Statements regarding how a mark is used (e.g., that the mark is not used in a particular color) are not appropriate and, if submitted, must not be printed on the registration certificate. <i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0800.html#ch800_d22412_18c2a_179">TMEP § 808.03(g)</a>. 
</p>
<p id="ch800_d2240e_18de1_eb">The description should describe all <i>significant</i> aspects of the mark, including both literal elements and design elements. Insignificant features need not be included in a description.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e5062">When a mark includes a large number of elements, they are not all necessarily <i>significant</i>. For example, background design elements can sometimes be considered insignificant if they do not change the overall commercial impression of the mark. In addition, it may be unnecessary to describe the placement of repetitive literal or design elements within a mark, as long as the description generally characterizes them and explains that the elements are repeated. Similarly, when a mark contains a substantial number of design elements, it may only be necessary to generally state in the description those elements that capture the essence of the mark. Please note that because of the requirement to describe where colors appear in the mark, marks that include color will generally have a more detailed description. 37 C.F.R. §2.52(b)(1). See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1488">TMEP §§807.07(a)</a>

<i>et seq</i>. regarding requirements for color drawings.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e5077">If a mark contains both wording and design features, the description should describe both aspects of the mark in order to be complete. The rare exception is for wording that is (1) not significant to the mark; and (2) would not be searched (e.g., purely informational matter such as product weight, lists of contents, and business addresses). The better – but not mandatory – practice with descriptions of non-standard character marks that include wording is to indicate that the wording is “in stylized font.”  
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e5081">Generally, if the applicant has not made a color claim, the description of the mark should not mention color, because a reference to color in the description of a non-colored mark creates a misleading impression. See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1476">TMEP §§807.07</a>

<i>et seq</i>. regarding color. However, in some cases, it may be appropriate to submit a black-and-white drawing and a description of the mark that refers to black, white, and/or gray if the applicant states that color is not claimed as a feature of the mark. See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1604">TMEP §§807.07(f)</a>

<i>et seq</i>. regarding applications that include mark descriptions that refer to black, white, or gray when there is no corresponding color claim.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e5095">If a trademark or a service mark that is registered to an entity other than the applicant is used in the description of the mark, the examining attorney must require that it be deleted and that generic wording be substituted. It is inappropriate to use a registered mark in a description because such a mark indicates origin in only one party and cannot be used to describe a mark used in connection with goods or services that originate in a party other than the registrant. 
<i>Cf. Camloc Fastener Corp. v. Grant</i>, 119 USPQ 264, 265, n.1 (TTAB 1958) (noting that if applicant prevailed in opposition proceeding, it would be required to delete registered mark from the identification of goods set forth in the application).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e5098">A description cannot be used to restrict the likely public perception of a mark. A mark’s meaning is based on the impression actually created by the mark in the minds of consumers, not on the impression that the applicant states the mark is intended to convey. However, an examining attorney may defer to the applicant’s phrasing of a description, so long as the description is accurate and complete. For example, if an element in a mark could reasonably be characterized in more than one way, the examining attorney should accept the applicant’s selection of one characterization over the other in the description.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e5116">After having determined that a description of the mark is required because the mark is not in standard characters, the examining attorney must then consider whether the description should be printed in the <i>Official Gazette</i> and on the registration certificate. 
<b 
>Accurate and complete descriptions may always be printed.
 In other situations, the decision to print – and to modify the description so that it is appropriate for printing – depends on whether, in view of the nature or drawing of the particular mark in question, a description is necessary to clarify the mark for the public.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e5119">For example, pursuant to longstanding policy, a description must <i>always</i> be printed if:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull">(1)  The mark is three-dimensional, or a configuration of the goods or packaging (

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1689">TMEP §§807.10</a>
 and 

<a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e1524">1202.02(c)(ii)</a>);
</li>
<li class="nobull">(2)  The drawing includes broken lines to show position or placement or to indicate a portion of the product or packaging that is not part of the mark (

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1644">TMEP §§807.08</a>
 and 

<a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e1524">1202.02(c)(ii)</a>);
</li>
<li class="nobull">(3)  The mark includes color (

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1488">TMEP §§807.07(a)</a>
 and 

<a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e2251">1202.05(e)</a>);
</li>
<li class="nobull">(4)  The mark includes motion (

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1699">TMEP §807.11</a>); or
</li>
<li class="nobull">(5)  The mark is a sound, scent, or other non-visual mark (37 C.F.R. §§2.37, 2.52(e); 

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1656">TMEP §§807.09</a>
 and 

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e2086">808.01</a>).
</li>
</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e5193">In rare instances, a description must be printed when the mark consists of characters from the standard character set, but the characters are displayed in a manner that affects the meaning or significantly contributes to the overall commercial impression of the mark, for example, emoticons such as :) or :(. Note that a standard character claim is not acceptable where the characters form shapes or designs, such as emoticons (

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1229">TMEP §807.03(c)</a>). 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e5200">If the examining attorney determines that a description provided by the applicant will not be printed, notice to the applicant is not required. The examining attorney must either enter a Note to the File in the record stating that the description should not be printed or issue an examiner’s amendment stating that the description will not be printed. Generally, the examining attorney may use either option, but a Note to the File should be used where the examining attorney will issue an Office action regarding other matters. An examiner’s amendment without the prior approval of the applicant (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e759">TMEP §707.02</a>) may be used where it is unnecessary to issue an Office action or a regular examiner’s amendment regarding other matters.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e5209">The examining attorney must then either: (1) delete the mark description from the “Description” field in the relevant Trademark database; or (2) send the examiner’s amendment or an e-mail instruction (where only a Note to the File was entered) to the LIE for appropriate action. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-9d85e5212">The foregoing procedures ensure that a description not intended for printing will not be printed. They further ensure that at the publication review stage, the Note to the File or examiner’s amendment reflects the determination not to print.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-10d85e5215">The following sections explain how to handle various scenarios relating to the description requirement. Regarding TEAS applications, please note that although TEAS Plus applications for non-standard character marks cannot be validated and filed unless an entry is made in the ”Description” field, “regular” TEAS applications can be filed without entry of a description. The “regular” TEAS application will, however, display a warning message in non-standard character mark applications where no entry has been made in the “Description of the Mark” field. The warning message will indicate that although the description is not a filing date requirement, it must be provided at some point in the prosecution, or the application will not proceed to registration (assuming, of course, that all other requirements have been satisfied).

Obvious misspellings, typographical errors and redundancies in an otherwise accurate and complete description may be corrected by examiner’s amendment without the prior approval of the applicant (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e759">TMEP §707.02</a>).

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e5244">If the description is not submitted with the initial application, the examining attorney must ensure that a description is included in the record. Applications that include vague statements such as “the mark contains wording and a design,” “the mark contains a miscellaneous design,” and “the mark consists of words” should be treated as the equivalent of accurate but incomplete descriptions.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e5247">For TEAS applications for marks that consist only of wording in stylized font, with no design element, the applicant’s completion of the “Literal Element” field may be accepted for purposes of compliance with the rule, even if an unacceptably vague statement or no information is entered in the “Description of the Mark” field. In these cases, where the description need not be printed, the “Literal Element” information need not be copied into the “Description of the Mark” field in the relevant Trademark database.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e5250">Likewise, for §66(a) applications for marks that consist only of wording in stylized font, with no design element, the applicant’s completion of the “Textual Elements of Mark” field may be accepted for purposes of compliance with the rule. In these cases, where the description need not be printed, the “Textual Elements of Mark” information need not be copied into the “Description” field in the relevant Trademark database.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e5254">Similarly, in any application for a mark that includes color, the applicant’s provision of a color location statement (either in the original application or in response to a requirement) may be accepted for purposes of compliance with the rule. For TEAS applications, a color location statement provided in the initial application will automatically appear in the “Description” field in the relevant Trademark database and should remain there for printing. For paper applications, the color location statement is placed in the “Description” field in the relevant Trademark database and should remain there for printing.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e5257">Where an Office action or regular examiner’s amendment is otherwise unnecessary, in the following situations the examining attorney may enter a description by examiner’s amendment without the prior approval of the applicant (as with any examiner’s amendment, the examining attorney is thereby providing the applicant with notice and an opportunity to disagree):
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull"> The mark consists only of wording in stylized font, with no color claim and with no design element (note that an examiner’s amendment would only be necessary where the applicant also failed to provide the “Literal Element,” which can serve as a description for this type of mark);
</li>
<li class="nobull"> The mark includes no color claim and consists only of wording in combination with underlining or a common geometric shape used as a vehicle for the display of the wording; or

<li class="nobull"> The record already contains an informal indication of what the mark comprises, such as where the cover letter of a paper application refers to the mark as “a stylized golf ball design.”

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-10d85e5287">In the foregoing examples, a description is necessary to comply with the requirements of the rule, but need not be printed in the <i>Official Gazette</i> or on the registration. In such cases, the “no-call” examiner’s amendment (

<a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e759">TMEP §707.02</a>) should neither be sent to the LIE nor entered for printing by the examining attorney. Where printing of the description is unnecessary, the examiner’s amendment must indicate that the description will not be printed in the <i>Official Gazette</i> or on the registration certificate. This indication in the examiner’s amendment ensures that at the publication review stage, the description is not mistakenly entered for printing.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-11d85e5293">On the other hand, where an Office action or examiner’s amendment regarding other matters is necessary, a description should be required in the Office action or entered by examiner’s amendment. If a response to an Office action requiring the description fails to include a description but resolves all other issues, and one of the special situations set out above applies, the examining attorney may do a “no-call” examiner’s amendment (

<a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e759">TMEP §707.02</a>) at that time. If all other issues have not been resolved, the requirement for a description must be maintained or made final, as appropriate.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-12d85e5300">For marks that include a design element of any kind that are not covered by the special situations set out above, the examining attorney must either issue a requirement for the description, or enter a description by examiner’s amendment, <i>with</i> the prior approval of the applicant. Once a description of the mark is received in response to an Office action or through an examiner’s amendment, the examining attorney must follow the procedures set forth in the other parts of

<p id="ch800_d22412_18cfd_ad">A statement that purports to limit a mark by excluding color(s) or other features that do not appear in a mark is not appropriate for inclusion in a description of a mark. Statements regarding any purported “exclusion” usually feature a limitation on the mark, often in an attempt to satisfy third parties that have infringement concerns. In some cases, the applicant has a written agreement with a potential opposer that addresses this issue. However, descriptions are solely to be used to describe the mark shown in the drawing and are not to be used to describe how the mark does not and will not appear. See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e2155">TMEP §808.02</a>.
</p>
<p id="ch800_d22412_18e0e_35e">Although these additional restrictive statements are uncommon, when they do appear the facts are generally as follows. The mark features a design and color is not claimed as a feature of the mark. The description of the mark is amended by the applicant to include a reference to a color or colors that the mark will not comprise. This type of statement is inappropriate and must be deleted from the description. For example, the following type of statement must not be included in a description of a mark: “The application and any registration resulting from the application exclude the color purple within or as part of the (design element) in the mark.” 
</p>
<p id="ch800_d22415_14892_b4">Thus, when the applicant has not made a color claim, the description of the mark must not mention color(s), because reference to color in the description of a non-color mark creates a misleading impression.

<h1 class="page-title">809  Translation and Transliteration of Non-English Wording in Mark</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e5396">An application to register a mark that includes non-English wording must include an English translation of that wording. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(9). This requirement also applies to compound word marks comprised of two or more distinct words (or words and syllables) that are represented as one word, in which one or more of the words in the mark appears to be non-English wording that would clearly be perceived as a distinct word(s) within the compound. For example, if the mark is GRINÇANTCOMPUTERS, the commercial impression is that the mark is comprised of the words GRINÇANT and COMPUTERS. In such a case, the application must include a translation of the French word GRINÇANT, which means “creaking” in English. If, however, the combination either suggests a single word or conveys a commercial impression other than a mark comprised of two separate words, no translation of the non-English portion should be required. Thus, if the mark is FELIZCITY, the commercial impression is that the mark is a play on the word “felicity” and no translation of the term “feliz” (which means “happy” in English) is required. <i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e2318">TMEP §809.01</a>
 regarding the procedure for examining applications for marks with non-English wording that do not include an accurate translation. 
</p>
<p id="ch800_d1b1a9_27aff">Similarly, an application for a mark that comprises non-Latin characters must include a transliteration of those characters, and either an English translation or a statement that this portion of the mark has no meaning in a foreign language. 37 C.F.R. §2.32(a)(10). A transliteration is the phonetic spelling, in corresponding Latin characters, of the word(s) in the mark that are in non-Latin characters. Examples of statements translating and transliterating a word in non-Latin characters are as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e5399">The non-Latin characters in the mark transliterate to “Asahi” and this means “Rising Sun” in English.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e5402">or</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e5406">The non-Latin characters in the mark transliterate to “Weidamei” and this has no meaning in a foreign language.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e5409">If an application for a mark comprising non-English wording or non-Latin characters does not include an accurate translation and/or transliteration, the examining attorney must require the applicant to submit a statement of translation/transliteration. 37 C.F.R. §§2.32(a)(9) and (10).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e5412">When an application or certificate of registration includes a translation, both the non-English wording and the English translation will appear in the records of the USPTO. See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e2389">TMEP §809.03</a>
 regarding the printing of the translation/transliteration statement in the <i>Official Gazette</i> and on the registration certificate.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-9d85e5418">In a TEAS Plus application, if the mark includes non-English wording, the initial application must include an English translation of that wording. 37 C.F.R. §2.22(a)(16). If the mark includes non-Latin characters, the application must include a transliteration of those characters. 37 C.F.R. §2.22(a)(17). If the applicant does not meet these requirements, the applicant must pay a processing fee per class to have the application examined as a regular TEAS application.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e5432">In order to properly examine applications with non-English wording, the translation and transliteration of the non-English wording must be determined prior to performing a search of the mark. This is critical because the foreign equivalent of an English term may be regarded in the same way as the English term for purposes of determining descriptiveness, requiring disclaimer, and citing marks under §2(d) of the Act (<i>see</i>, <i>e.g.,</i>

<a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e5616">TMEP §§1207.01(b)(vi)</a>

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e5441">Therefore, if there is no translation and/or transliteration in the initial application, the examining attorney should ascertain the meaning of non-English wording before searching the mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e5444">The examining attorney may obtain the meaning of non-English wording through sources such as foreign language dictionaries and search engines. The examining attorney may also consult the Trademark Librarian or the Translations Branch, as appropriate.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e5448">If research by the examining attorney, the Trademark Library, and/or the Translations Branch indicates that the term has no meaning or no clear and exact equivalent in a foreign language, although no inquiry regarding the meaning in a foreign language is necessary, the examining attorney has the discretion under 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b) to make such an inquiry. The examining attorney should enter a Note to the File in the record indicating that the term has no meaning in a foreign language. In such cases, a statement regarding meaning should not be entered for printing in the <i>Official Gazette</i>.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e5451">If the examining attorney determines the meaning of the non-English term(s), he or she must search the terms as they appear in the application, the transliterated terms, and the English translation(s) for the terms, as applicable. The examining attorney must also require (under 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b)) that an accurate translation be made of record by the applicant using the researched translation or other accurate translation provided by applicant. If the applicant disputes a translation obtained through online resources, the examining attorney should supplement the record with evidence from the Trademark Librarian and/or the Translations Branch.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e5454">If the translation is provided or supplemented after the examining attorney has conducted a search for conflicting marks, the examining attorney must conduct a new search of the transliterated terms and/or the English translation(s) for the terms, as applicable.

<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e2389">TMEP §809.03</a>. If a general inquiry is made regarding meaning under 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b) (i.e., whether the term has significance in the relevant trade, any geographical significance, or any meaning in a foreign language), the applicant’s response may not be in the correct format for the translation or transliteration statement. If necessary, the examining attorney should ensure that the translation or transliteration is entered in the relevant Trademark database, using the appropriate format. See TMEP §809.03. It is not necessary to issue an examiner's amendment in such cases. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e5471">If the applicant responds to an inquiry regarding the meaning of non-English wording by stating that “the term has no significance in the relevant trade, no geographical significance, and no meaning in a foreign language,” the statement should not be entered into the relevant Trademark database.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e5506">It is generally unnecessary to provide a translation of a foreign term if the term appears in an English dictionary (e.g., croissant, fiesta or flambé). However, if a term that appears in the English dictionary appears in a mark as part of a foreign idiomatic phrase or other unitary expression, a translation of the idiomatic phrase or unitary expression is required. It would be illogical to break the phrase into its individual word elements and to translate only the individual words that do not appear in the English dictionary. Such a translation would serve no useful purpose because it would not convey the true commercial impression of the phrase.
</p>
<div 
 class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-1d85e5511">
<i>Example:</i> If the mark included the phrase “la fiesta grande,” an appropriate translation would be “the great celebration” or possibly “the great fiesta.” It would be inappropriate to translate only “la” and “grande.” The ultimate goal is to provide a translation that reflects the true meaning of the non-English wording in the mark and the commercial impression made by the entire phrase.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e5566">The translation that should be relied upon in examination is the English meaning that has significance in the United States as the equivalent of the meaning in the non-English language. The following are examples of equivalency in translation:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull">(1) “Chat Noir” - The exact equivalent in English is “black cat,” and this translation would undoubtedly be recognized by the purchasing public in this country. 
<i>Ex parte Odol-Werke Wien Gesellschaft M.B.H.</i>, 111 USPQ 286 (Comm’r Pats. 1956) (mark “Chat Noir” refused registration because the words “Black Cat” were already registered for related goods).
</li>
<li class="nobull">(2) “Mais Oui” - The English equivalent of the phrase “mais oui” is “why, certainly,” or “why, of course,” and not the literal translation “but yes.” 
<i>In re Societe Des Parfums Schiaparelli, S.A.</i>, 122 USPQ 349 (TTAB 1959). A satisfactory translation must be some normal English expression that will be the equivalent in meaning of the term “mais oui” in French.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(3) “Schwarzkopf” - The term can be literally translated as “black head,” but, even to German-speaking persons, the primary significance of “Schwarzkopf” is most likely that of a surname. Neither English nor foreign surnames should be translated. See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e9735">TMEP §1211</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e5766">A filing fee is required for each class in a multiple-class application under §1 or §44 of the Trademark Act. 37 C.F.R. §2.86(a)(2). The USPTO has established the following policy to ensure the collection of application filing fees from all applicants on an equitable basis.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e5769">In an application under §1 or §44, if the applicant has specifically authorized the USPTO to charge any additional fees to a deposit account, the examining attorney should ask the LIE to charge the fees, and proceed with examination of the application on the merits. If the applicant has not provided a specific authorization to charge an account, the examining attorney should attempt to contact the applicant to secure a written authorization to charge fees to a credit card or deposit account by fax or-e-mail.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e5772">An authorization to charge a fee to a deposit account must be made in a written document signed and submitted by an authorized person. It cannot be entered by examiner’s amendment unless the record already contains a written authorization, signed and submitted by someone who is authorized to charge fees to the account. See <a href="tmep-0400.html#TMEP-400d1e232">TMEP §405.03</a>

 regarding the amount of the fee for adding classes to an application.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e5784">If an authorization to charge fees has not been provided and the examining attorney is unable to secure one, the examining attorney must issue a written Office action noting the deficiency and requiring either payment of the fees or deletion of classes. This policy applies to any application under §1 or §44 of the Trademark Act in which the applicant specifically delineates more than one class of goods or services and the applicant has paid the fee(s) for less than all the classes. The delineation may be by indicating class numbers or any other means demonstrating a clear intention to seek registration in multiple classes.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e5787">In limited circumstances, the examining attorney should advise the applicant that action on the merits of the application is deferred pending receipt of the applicant’s response to the Office action requiring payment of missing fees or deletion of classes. In most cases, the examining attorney should simply act on the merits of the application and require the additional fees. For example, it would be inappropriate to defer action in a <i>pro se</i> application or in other cases where the applicant has in good faith attempted to pay the appropriate fees. Before issuing a letter deferring action until additional fees are paid, the examining attorney should consult with the managing attorney or senior attorney.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-9d85e5790">The filing fee for a §66(a) application will be sent to the USPTO by the IB, pursuant to the provisions of the Madrid Protocol and the Common Regulations. The examining attorney should not require additional fees during examination. The classification in a §66(a) application cannot be changed and additional classes cannot be added.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e5805">Only money paid by mistake or in excess (when a fee is not required by the statute or rules, or is not required in the amount paid) may be refunded. A mere change of purpose after the payment of money does not entitle a party to a refund. For example, if an applicant deletes a class from an application, or withdraws an application, the applicant is not entitled to a refund. 37 C.F.R. §2.209.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e5808">The filing fee for an application that is denied a filing date will be refunded. After an application has been given a filing date and processed, the filing fee will normally not be returned. However, if an examining attorney erroneously requires a fee, the USPTO will refund any fee submitted in response to the erroneous requirement.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e5811">If the examining attorney determines that an applicant is entitled to a refund, he or she should submit the request to the TMFinance@uspto.gov e-mail box with the information necessary for processing the refund.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e5815">If the examining attorney is uncertain as to whether a refund is appropriate, he or she should discuss the situation with the managing attorney or senior attorney.

<i>37 C.F.R. §2.36   </i>
</h4>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e5852">Identification of prior registrations. Prior registrations of the same or similar marks owned by the applicant should be identified in the application.
</p>
</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e5855">Trademark Rule 2.36, 37 C.F.R. §2.36, states that prior registrations of the same or similar marks owned by the applicant should be identified in the application. The rule does not precisely define when an applicant should claim ownership of prior registration(s), and the examining attorney may exercise discretion in invoking the rule. The main purpose of the rule is to provide the examining attorney with information necessary for proper examination. The information does not have to be given in any specific form. The applicant’s claim of ownership of prior registrations will be printed in the <i>Official Gazette</i> and on the registration certificate.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e5858">Normally, identification of a registration is necessary because the registration would, if not owned by the applicant, be a basis for refusal under §2(d) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1052(d). Occasionally, it is desirable to ask an applicant to identify a particular registration as being owned by the applicant merely to provide relevant information.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e5862">It is not necessary to assert ownership of expired or cancelled registrations. If the applicant wants to include a reference to a cancelled or expired registration, the applicant should indicate that the applicant owns the <i>mark</i> disclosed in the cancelled or expired registration, because technically one does not “own” a registration that is not in force and effect. Claims of ownership of pending applications, expired or cancelled registrations, and registrations that are unrelated to an application will not be printed.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e5865">Before approving an application that includes a claim of ownership of prior registrations for publication or registration, the examining attorney must ensure that the registrations are active. If a registration is not active, the claim of ownership should not be printed.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e5868">All information in the “Prior Registration” field in the application record in the Trademark database will automatically be printed in the <i>Official Gazette</i> and on the certificate of registration. Accordingly, when an examining attorney determines that a claim of ownership of a prior registration should not be printed (e.g., because the registration is no longer active or is irrelevant to the registrability of the mark in the subject application), the examining attorney must ensure that the claim of ownership is deleted from the Trademark database, and enter a Note to the File in the record indicating that the claim has been deleted. The document containing the information deleted from the Trademark database will remain of record for informational purposes. See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e2729">TMEP §817</a>
 regarding preparation of an application for publication or issuance.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-9d85e5874">If the applicant owns numerous prior registrations, it is not necessary to list them all. The applicant should specifically identify the two or three registration numbers that are most relevant (due to the similarity of the marks and/or relatedness of the goods or services), and then indicate that it owns other registrations as well, e.g., “the applicant is the owner of Reg. Nos. &lt;specify the numbers&gt; and others.” If the applicant lists numerous prior registrations, the database will only show the first three registration numbers entered in the claim of ownership field and will automatically indicate “and others” as to any additional registration numbers. Therefore, the examining attorney must ensure that the claim of ownership identifies the two or three most relevant registration numbers.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-10d85e5877">In a TEAS Plus application, if the applicant owns one or more registrations for the <i>same</i> mark, the initial application must include a claim of ownership of the registration(s). If this information is not included in the initial application, the applicant must pay a processing fee per class to have the application examined as a regular TEAS application. 37 C.F.R. §2.22(a)(19). See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e3273">TMEP §819.01(p)</a>

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-800d1e2520">812.01  Proving Ownership of Prior Registrations</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e5891">If an applicant includes a claim of ownership of a prior registration, or a pending application, in the application as filed, the examining attorney must accept the claim without further proof of ownership and must not cite the registration for likelihood of confusion under §2(d) of the Act or advise the applicant that there may be a conflict with the earlier-filed application.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e5894">If the applicant does not assert ownership of a pertinent registration in the application when it is filed, but the Trademark database indicates that an assignment was filed as to the registration, the examining attorney must check the database of the USPTO’s Assignment Recordation Branch to determine whether information contained in the database supports ownership of the registration in the applicant’s name. If records in the Assignment Recordation Branch's database indicate that the registration is owned by the applicant, the examining attorney must not cite the registration for likelihood of confusion, but must call the registration to the applicant’s attention and ask the applicant to state that the applicant owns the registration, if accurate. If the request is made in an Office action, the examining attorney must include a copy of the registration. If there are no other issues necessitating issuance of an Office action, the examining attorney may call or e-mail the applicant. The applicant’s statement claiming ownership may be placed in the record through an examiner’s amendment.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e5901">Generally, the applicant has the burden of proving ownership of a registration. The USPTO’s automated search system may not reflect the recordation of changes of ownership in the Assignment Recordation Branch. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0500.html#TMEP-500d1e196">TMEP §§502</a>

<i>et seq</i>. Therefore, if an applicant does not assert ownership of a pertinent registration in an application when it is filed, the registration must be cited against the current application under §2(d) because the USPTO's records do not indicate that it is owned by the applicant. If so, the applicant must do one of the following to verify its ownership claim: (1) state for the record that the documents have been recorded in the Assignment Recordation Branch for a registration based on an application under §1 or §44 of the Trademark Act, or with the IB for a §66(a) registration; (2) submit copies of documents evidencing the chain of title; or (3) submit a statement, supported by an affidavit or declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20, that the applicant is the owner of the cited registration. This also applies to pending conflicting applications that are cited as a potential bar to registration.
</p>
<p id="ch800_d1fea0_27172_10f">A refusal under §2(d) cannot be overcome by a claim of ownership of a registration made by the applicant in another registration file when the USPTO’s records do not indicate that the registration is owned by the applicant.

The requirement for consent also applies to the registration of a pseudonym, stage name, or nickname, if there is evidence that the name identifies a specific living individual who is publicly connected with the goods or services, is generally known, or is well known in the field relating to the relevant goods or services.

<h1 class="page-title">814   Requesting Additional Information</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e6107">Sometimes, it is necessary for the examining attorney to request additional information from an applicant in order to examine the application properly, pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b). If the applicant does not comply with a requirement for additional information, registration may be refused.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e6110">If the applicant does not comply with the examining attorney’s request for information, the requirement should be repeated and, if appropriate, made final. 
<i>See</i> <i>In re AOP LLC</i>, 107 USPQ2d 1644, 1651 (TTAB 2013) (“Failure to comply with a request for information is grounds for refusal,” where applicant provided equivocal responses to the examining attorney’s questions and did not address this issue in its brief); <i>In re DTI Partnership LLP</i>, 67 USPQ2d 1699 (TTAB 2003) (deeming §2(e)(1) refusal moot, since failure to comply with requirement for information is sufficient basis, in itself, for refusal); <i>In re SPX Corp.</i>, 63 USPQ2d 1592 (TTAB 2002) (finding registration properly refused where applicant ignored request for information); <i>In re Page</i>, 51 USPQ2d 1660 (TTAB 1999) (finding intent-to-use applicant’s failure to comply with requirement for information as to the intended use of the mark constituted grounds for refusal); <i>In re Babies Beat Inc.</i>, 13 USPQ2d 1729, 1731 (TTAB 1990) (finding registration properly refused where applicant failed to comply with examining attorney’s request for copies of patent applications and other patent information); <i>In re Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.</i>, 192 USPQ 157, 158 (TTAB 1976) (“[Trademark Rule 2.61(b)] has the effect of law.”).

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e6113">The examining attorney may request literature, exhibits, affidavits or declarations, and general information concerning circumstances surrounding the mark, as well as, if applicable, its use or intended use. 
<i>See</i> 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b). Requests for information that is not public knowledge, but is within the knowledge of the applicant or available to the applicant, are particularly appropriate. The examining attorney should explain why the information is needed, if the reason is not obvious.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e6117">If applicant wants to provide information from its website in response to the examining attorney’s request for information, applicant should attach the relevant information to its response. It is not sufficient to provide only the applicant’s website address. In addition, a mere statement that information about the goods or services is available on applicant’s website is an inappropriate response to the examining attorney’s request for information, and insufficient to make the relevant information of record. 
<i>In re Planalytics, Inc.</i>, 70 USPQ2d 1453 (TTAB 2004).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e6120">If applicant does not believe that it has relevant information, applicant should submit a statement to this effect.
</p>
<p 
>An applicant’s failure to comply with an information request may lead to the presumption that had applicant responded to the requirement, the response would have been unfavorable to the applicant. <i>See</i> <i>In re AOP LLC</i>, 107 USPQ2d at 1651 (noting because applicant had failed to comply with the examining attorney’s information requirement, “to the extent there is any ambiguity regarding the origin and certification of applicant’s goods we address both [merely descriptive and deceptively misdescriptive] refusals in the alternative based on the presumption that had applicant directly and fully responded to the examining attorney’s inquiries, the responses would have been unfavorable,”); <i>In re Cheezwhse.com, Inc.</i>, 85 USPQ2d 1917, 1919 (TTAB 2008) (making factual presumptions unfavorable to the applicant in considering alternative statutory refusals under §§2(e)(2) and 2(e)(3), in view of the applicant’s failure to comply with the examining attorney’s requirement for information as to the geographic origin of the goods).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e6123">If the requested information is confidential, or if, for a valid reason, the applicant does not want to have the information become part of a public record, the applicant should consider redacting such portions of documents prior to their submission. Documents filed in the USPTO by the applicant become part of the official record and will not be returned or removed. 37 C.F.R. §2.25;

<i>Example</i>: The goods are identified in the application as “pants" and "shirts,” and the applicant files a voluntary amendment to “pants, shirts and dresses.” The examining attorney will refuse the amended identification because “dresses” is beyond the scope of the original identification (37 C.F.R. §2.71(a)), but no additional fee will be required.

<i>Fill-in-the-Blank Element</i>. Some USPTO ID Manual entries require the applicant to complete parenthetical information (e.g., “specify the function of the programs”). The display of such entries will include a free-text field so the applicant can type the necessary information, following the instructions within the listing. If an applicant attempts to use such a listing without completing the required information, TEAS Plus will generate an error message.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e7733">No additional fee is required if the identification of goods/services has a fill-in-the-blank element, and the applicant inserts information that is a reasonable attempt to supply the required information in accordance with the instructions, but requires amendment because the inserted information: (1) sets forth goods/services in another class (e.g., headgear, namely, football helmets (headgear that is clothing is in Class 25, helmets are in Class 9)); (2) is indefinite (e.g., maternity clothing, namely, sportswear); or (3) is inaccurate (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1400.html#TMEP-1400d1e2370">TMEP §1402.05</a>). 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-9d85e7739">However, an additional fee is required if the applicant leaves the fill-in-the-blank element empty, inserts information that is clearly inappropriate for the selected identification, or inserts additional goods/services that are unrelated to the selected identification. For example, an additional fee is required if the goods/services in the original application are identified as follows:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull"> “processed meat, namely, <i>laptop computers</i>;”
</li>
<li class="nobull"> “bicycle parts, namely, <i>bicycle parts</i>;”
</li>
<li class="nobull"> “cutlery, namely forks, knives, and <i>rain jackets for dogs</i>;” or
</li>
<li class="nobull"> “sound recordings featuring music, <i>and sunglasses</i>.”
</li>
</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-11d85e7769">In these situations, the applicant has, in effect, failed to submit an identification from the USPTO ID Manual. The additional fee is required even if the applicant deletes the unacceptable terminology.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-12d85e7773">
<i>Classification</i>. Trademark Rule 2.22(a)(8) indicates that if the applicant classified the goods/services in the wrong class in the initial application, the applicant will lose TEAS Plus status and will be required to pay the additional fee for all classes in the application. However, this is unlikely to occur, because the TEAS Plus form will automatically provide the correct class for goods/services selected from the USPTO ID Manual, and it will not permit the applicant to edit the “Classification” field. No additional fee is required if the identification is acceptable and correctly classified as filed, but is amended during examination to add or substitute another class (e.g., amendment from “headwear” in Class 25 to “protective helmets for sports” in Class 9; or amendment from “footwear” in Class 25 to “orthopedic footwear” in Class 10), as long as the amendment is filed through TEAS or entered by examiner’s amendment.

TEAS Plus requires the applicant to indicate whether the mark is stylized or in standard characters, and will not accept the transmission unless the applicant selects one of these options. If the applicant claims standard characters, TEAS Plus will not accept transmission unless something has been typed in the appropriate field. The TEAS Plus system will generate a digitized image of the standard character mark and attach it to the application.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-6d85e8228">When issuing a nonfinal action on a TEAS Plus application, the examining attorney will require that the applicant either: (1) respond through TEAS (or by examiner’s amendment, if appropriate); or (2) if responding on paper, include the additional TEAS Plus processing fee with the response. If the applicant files a paper response without the required fee, the requirement for payment of the fee will be made final, assuming that the application is otherwise in condition for final refusal.

<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e8247">Amendments to classification are rare in TEAS Plus applications, since the identification of goods/services is taken from the USPTO ID Manual, and the TEAS Plus form does not permit the applicant to edit the “Classification” field. In the rare case where the TEAS Plus applicant amends the application to add a product or service that is within the scope of the original identification of goods/services, but is in a different class, the fee for the additional class is the reduced TEAS Plus fee, as long as the amendment is filed through TEAS or entered by examiner’s amendment. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1400.html#TMEP-1400d1e3058">TMEP §1403.02(c)</a>. 
</p>
<div 
 class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-1d85e8255">
<i>Example</i>: The applicant selects the identification “hair shampoo” in Class 3. The applicant later adds “dandruff shampoo” in Class 5, which is within the scope of the original identification. The applicant will pay the reduced TEAS Plus fee, as long as the applicant has not lost TEAS Plus status for some other reason.
</p>
</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-5d85e8259">If the applicant adds a class after losing TEAS Plus status, the applicant must pay the regular TEAS fee if the fee is paid through TEAS or by examiner’s amendment, or the paper fee if the class is added by a paper amendment.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-800d1e3371">819.04  Procedures for Payment of TEAS Plus Processing Fee Per Class </h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-3d85e8271">A TEAS Plus applicant must pay a processing fee per class to have the application examined as a regular TEAS application if: (1) the initial application does not meet the requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.22(a); (2) the applicant files one of the documents listed in 37 C.F.R. §2.23(a)(1) on paper; or (3) the applicant files a notice of change of correspondence address that does not authorize e-mail correspondence. 37 C.F.R. §§2.6(a)(1)(iv) , 2.23(a)(2), and 2.23(b). The application will retain its original filing date, assuming the initial application met the minimum filing requirements that are mandatory for all applications under 37 C.F.R. §2.21(a).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-4d85e8274">
<i>Processing Fee Must Be Paid for All Active Classes</i>. If the applicant loses TEAS Plus status, the applicant must pay the TEAS Plus processing fee per class <i>for all classes that are in the application at the time the examining attorney issues the Office action requiring the TEAS Plus processing fee</i>.
</p>
<div 
 class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-1d85e8279">
<i>Example</i>: The original application is for two classes. The applicant loses TEAS Plus status because in the original application, the applicant failed to include a transliteration of the Chinese characters in the mark. The first Office action includes: (1) a requirement for a transliteration; (2) a requirement for the additional fee for two classes; and (3) a refusal of registration as to one class under §2(d) of the Trademark Act. If the applicant responds by submitting a transliteration and deleting the class that was refused, the applicant must pay the processing fee for two classes, because there were two classes in the application when the Office action requiring the processing fee was issued.
</p>
</div>
<div 
 class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-1d85e8286">
<i>Example</i>: The original application is for two classes. One of the items in the identification has a fill-in-the-blank element and requires amendment. The first Office action includes: (1) a requirement to amend the identification of goods/services; and (2) a refusal of registration because the mark is merely descriptive of the goods. The applicant responds through TEAS by deleting a class and submitting evidence that the mark has acquired distinctiveness. The examining attorney issues another refusal. If the applicant responds on paper, the applicant is only required to pay the processing fee for one class, because the applicant deleted the second class before the applicant lost TEAS Plus status.
</p>
</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-7d85e8290">
<i>Examiner’s Amendment</i>. If all remaining issues can be handled through a telephone or e-mail conversation with the applicant or the applicant’s qualified practitioner, and the applicant uses a deposit account to pay the fee or faxes an authorization to charge the fee to a credit card, the fee may be collected by examiner’s amendment. However, a fee cannot be charged to a deposit account by examiner’s amendment unless the record contains a written authorization, signed by someone who is authorized to charge fees to the account. If there is no written authorization in the record, the applicant may submit the authorization by fax or e-mail. See <a href="tmep-0400.html#TMEP-400d1e232">TMEP §405.03</a>
 regarding deposit accounts.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-8d85e8296">
<i>Combined Examiner’s Amendment/Priority Action</i>. If all of the issues except payment of the processing fee are resolved by a telephone or e-mail conversation with the applicant or the applicant’s qualified practitioner, the examining attorney may issue a combined Examiner’s Amendment/Priority Action (

<a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e1035">TMEP §708.05</a>) to enter the amendment(s) and require payment of the TEAS Plus processing fee.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-9d85e8302">
<i>No Partial Refusal</i>. If the applicant loses TEAS Plus status, the requirement for the TEAS Plus processing fee applies to the entire application, so an Office action requiring the processing fee can never be a partial refusal.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-800-10d85e8305">
<i>Paying the Processing Fee Through TEAS</i>. To pay the TEAS Plus processing fee through TEAS, the applicant must use the TEAS Response to Office Action (“ROA”) form. The TEAS "Voluntary Amendment Not in Response to USPTO Office Action/Letter” form does not permit payment of the TEAS Plus processing fee. Also, if the requirement for the processing fee is issued in the first action, TEAS will not allow the applicant to use the TEAS ROA form to pay the fee until 48-72 hours after the Office action is entered into the Trademark database.
