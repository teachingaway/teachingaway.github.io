<div>Madrid Protocol
<div xmlns="" class="Section">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-2d139e14">The Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (“Madrid Protocol”) is an international treaty that allows a trademark owner to seek registration in any of the countries or intergovernmental organizations that have joined the Madrid Protocol by submitting a single application, called an international application. The international registration system is administered by the International Bureau (“IB”) of the World Intellectual Property Organization (“WIPO”), in Geneva, Switzerland. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-2d139e15">The Madrid Protocol became effective in the United States on November 2, 2003. The Madrid Protocol Implementation Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-273, 116 Stat. 1758, 1913-1921 (“MPIA”) amended the Trademark Act to provide that: (1) the owner of a United States application and/or registration may seek protection of its mark in any of the countries or intergovernmental organizations party to the Madrid Protocol by submitting a single international application to the IB through the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”); and (2) the holder of an international registration may request an extension of protection of the international registration to the United States. A notice of final rulemaking amending the Trademark Rules of Practice to incorporate the MPIA was published at 68 Fed. Reg. 55748 (Sept. 26, 2003). 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-2d139e16">The Madrid Protocol, <i>Common Regulations Under the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks and the Protocol Relating to That Agreement (“Common Regs.”), Guide to the International Registration of Marks under the Madrid Agreement and the Madrid Protocol (“Guide to International Registration”), Administrative Instructions for the Application of the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks and the Protocol Relating Thereto</i> (“Admin. Instrs.”) are available on the IB’s website, at 

<a href="http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/" target="_blank">http://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/</a>
. The Common Regs. are the procedures agreed to by the parties to the Madrid Protocol regarding the administration of the Madrid Protocol, pursuant to Madrid Protocol Article (“Article”) 10(2)(iii). 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-2d139e17">References below to the Common Regs., <i>Guide to the International Registration</i>, and Admin. Instrs. refer to the September 2009 editions.

<div xmlns="" class="Section" id="TMEP-1900d1e21">
<h1 class="page-title">1901  Overview of the Madrid System of International Registration</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-3d139e18">The Madrid system of international registration is governed by two treaties: the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks, which dates from 1891, and the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement, which was adopted in 1989, entered into force on December 1, 1995, and came into operation on April 1, 1996. The United States is party only to the Protocol, not to the Agreement.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-4d139e21">The Madrid system is administered by the IB. To apply for an international registration under the Madrid Protocol, an applicant must be a national of, be domiciled in, or have a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in one of the countries or intergovernmental organizations that are members of the Protocol (“Contracting Parties”). The application must be based on one or more trademark application(s) filed in, or registration(s) issued by, the trademark office of one of the Contracting Parties (“basic application(s)” or “basic registration(s)”). The international application must be for the same mark and include a list of goods/services that is identical to or narrower than the list of goods/services in the basic application and/or registration. The international application must designate one or more Contracting Parties in which an extension of protection of the international registration is sought.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-5d139e24">The applicant must submit the international application through the trademark office of the Contracting Party in which the basic application and/or registration is held (“Office of Origin”). The Office of Origin must certify that the information in the international application corresponds with the information in the basic application and/or registration, and then forward the international application to the IB. If the IB receives the international application within two months of the date of receipt in the Office of Origin, the date of the international registration is the date of receipt in the Office of Origin. If the IB does not receive the international application within two months of the date it was received by the Office of Origin, the date of the international registration is the date on which the international application is received by the IB. See <a href="tmep-1900.html#TMEP-1900d1e455">TMEP §1902.04</a>
 for information regarding filing requirements that may affect the international registration date.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-6d139e31">The international registration is dependent on the basic application and/or registration for five years from the international registration date. If the basic application and/or registration is abandoned, cancelled, or expired, in whole or in part, during this five-year period, the IB will cancel the international registration accordingly. See <a href="tmep-1900.html#TMEP-1900d1e851">TMEP §1902.09</a>
 for further information.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-7d139e37">The holder of an international registration may request protection in additional Contracting Parties by submitting a subsequent designation. A subsequent designation is a request by the holder of an international registration for an extension of protection of the registration to additional Contracting Parties.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-8d139e40">Each Contracting Party designated in an international application or subsequent designation will examine the request for extension of protection as a national trademark application under its domestic laws. Under Article 5 and Common Regs. 16 and 17, there are strict time limits (a maximum of 18 months) for the trademark office of a Contracting Party to refuse a request for extension of protection. If the Contracting Party does not notify the IB of a refusal within this time period, the mark is automatically protected. However, the extension of protection may be invalidated in accordance with the same procedures for invalidating a national registration, e.g., by cancellation.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-9d139e43">The Madrid Protocol may apply to the USPTO in three ways:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li class="nobull"> <i>Office of Origin</i>. The USPTO is the Office of Origin if an international application and/or registration is based on an application pending in or a registration issued by the USPTO. Common Reg. 1(xxvi). 
<i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-1900.html#TMEP-1900d1e56">TMEP §§1902</a>

<i>et seq</i>.
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Office of a Designated Contracting Party.</i> The USPTO is the office of a designated Contracting Party if the holder of an international registration requests an extension of protection of that registration to the United States. Common Regs. 1(xvi) and (xxv). 
<i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-1900.html#TMEP-1900d1e982">TMEP §§1904</a>

<i>et seq</i>.
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Office of the Contracting Party of the Holder.</i> If the holder of an international registration is a national of, is domiciled in, or has a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the United States, the holder can file certain requests with the IB through the USPTO, such as requests to record changes of ownership (
<i>see</i>

<a href="tmep-1900.html#TMEP-1900d1e1750">TMEP §1906.01(a)(i)</a>
) and restrictions on the holder’s right to dispose of an international registration (
<i>see</i>

<a href="tmep-1900.html#TMEP-1900d1e1851">TMEP §1906.01(b))</a>
. The expression “Contracting Party of the Holder” includes the “Office of Origin,” as well as any other Contracting Party in which a holder is a national, is domiciled, or has a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment. Common Reg. 1(xxvibis).

If assignment records do not show a clear chain of title to the international applicant, the USPTO will notify the applicant that the application cannot be certified. If the records of the Assignment Recordation Branch do show a clear chain of title, the trademark specialist will update the “Ownership” field in the Trademark database.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-7d139e476">Because a delay in certifying and forwarding an international application to the IB may affect the date of the international registration, any request to record a change in ownership of a U.S. basic application and/or registration should be filed well in advance of the filing of the international application, to allow sufficient processing time. The USPTO strongly recommends use of the Electronic Trademark Assignment System (“ETAS”), at 

<a href="http://etas.uspto.gov/" target="_blank">http://etas.uspto.gov</a>
. Assignments filed electronically are recorded much faster than assignments filed on paper. If there is an unrecorded change in ownership, and the international applicant does not use ETAS to record the change, the USPTO may be unable to certify or forward the international application to the IB within two months after the application is received in the USPTO. In this situation, the date of the international registration will be the date of receipt of the application in the IB.

If the applicant lists any goods/services that are broader in scope than the goods/services in the basic application or registration, the USPTO will not certify the international application.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-4d139e592">The prepopulated TEAS form will include the listing of goods/services in the USPTO’s electronic records for the basic application or registration as of the time the form is generated. An applicant may edit the list of goods/services by either deleting particular goods/services or revising the wording in the identification. On the MM2 paper form and the free-text TEAS form, the applicant must enter the goods/services manually and may omit goods or services, or revise the wording in the identification.
</p>
<p id="ch1900_d1d848_22b4f_33f">In general, semicolons should be used to separate distinct categories of goods/services within a class. <i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-1400.html#TMEP-1400d1e2017">TMEP §1402.01(a)</a>
. For example, “cleaners, namely, glass cleaners, oven cleaners, and carpet cleaners; deodorizers for pets” is an acceptable identification in Class 3. In this example, the word “cleaners” names the category covering “glass cleaners, oven cleaners, and carpet cleaners.” The semicolon prior to “deodorizers for pets” indicates that the deodorizers are a separate category of goods from the cleaners.
</p>
<p id="ch1900_d1d848_22c4f_73">Similarly, commas should be used to separate items within a particular category of goods/services. For example, “clothing, namely, hats, caps, sweaters, and jeans” is an acceptable identification of goods in Class 25 and shows proper use of commas.
</p>
<p id="ch1900_d1d848_22c73_16c">Colons and periods should not be used as punctuation within the identification of goods and services.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-6d139e599">When the MPU trademark specialist reviews an international application based on a basic application and/or registration that has been amended during the course of its examination, the list of goods/services in the international application must be within the scope of the goods/services in the basic application and/or registration as amended, and not as set forth in the original basic application and/or registration.

<p id="ch1900_d1d848_24ad2_f1">If an international applicant identifies services with the introductory language “providing a website …” or “providing an on-line portal …,” regardless of the subject activities that follow, the IB is likely to issue a notice of irregularity requiring the applicant to clarify the nature of the services and possibly suggesting “hosting of a website …” and/or reclassification to Class 42. To avoid issuance of a notice of irregularity by the IB, an international applicant may wish to set forth its services with the principal activity first and then indicate that such services are “provided by means of a website” or “provided through an online portal.”

<p id="ch1900_d1d848_25434_1fe">The IB provides a database of properly classified terms, the Madrid Goods and Services Manager (MGSM), at

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1900d1e295">1902.02(g)(ii)  United States Classes A, B, and 200</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-3d139e662">Classes A, B, and 200 are classes from the old United States classification system that are still used in the United States to classify certification marks for goods (Class A), certification marks for services (Class B), and collective membership marks (Class 200). These classes are not included in the international classes under the Nice Agreement. Therefore, an international application based on a U.S. application or registration in U.S. Classes A, B, or 200 should be reclassified based on the nature of the goods or services being certified or the area of activity of the members of the collective. If the applicant does not reclassify its goods or services into the proper international class, the IB will issue a notice of irregularity.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-4d139e665">Amendment of the classification in the corresponding basic U.S. application and/or registration is not permitted.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-5d139e668">
<i>United States Classes A and B</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-6d139e672">It has been the longstanding practice in the United States to accept identifications of goods or services for Classes A, B, and 200 that are broader than those that would be accepted in applications for goods/services in other classes. 
<i>See </i>

<a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e517">TMEP §§1304.08(d)</a>
 and 

<a href="tmep-1300.html#TMEP-1300d1e784">1306.06(e)</a>
. In many situations, it will be difficult to reclassify these broad identifications into appropriate international classes. For example, a goods certification mark in U.S. Class A for “remanufactured, refurbished and reconditioned electrical equipment” could include goods in International Classes 7, 9, and/or 11, and possibly others. In such situations, the U.S. applicant should specify the type of electrical equipment that is being certified, and either apply and pay the fees for all appropriate classes, or limit the specification of “electric equipment” to cover goods in one class only.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-7d139e681">In some certification mark applications/registrations, the goods/services will be easily classified in one class of the international classification system. For example, a services certification mark for “testing laboratory and calibration laboratory accreditation services” would be classified in International Class 42. However, it is important to be aware that multiple classes may be required when reclassifying goods/services from U.S. Classes A and B.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-8d139e684">
<i>United States Class 200</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-9d139e687">Class 200 presents a similar problem and a similar solution. A broad identification of the subject organization in a collective membership mark application or registration is difficult to reclassify. For example, the wording “indicating membership in a conservative youth organization” is too broad and vague for classification in an international class. On the other hand, “indicating membership in an organization of consulting communications engineers” is easily classified in International Class 42. As with the certification marks, an applicant may have to clarify, specify, or narrow the description of the organization in the international application in order to classify the organization in an international class.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1900d1e313">1902.02(g)(iii)  Kits and Gift Baskets</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-3d139e699">The USPTO policy regarding the identification and classification of kits and gift baskets differs from the policy of the IB regarding the classification of these goods.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-4d139e702">The USPTO permits registration of a kit or gift basket in a single international class, even if the identification of goods lists items that are classified in other classes. The IB and most foreign countries will not accept an identification of goods in a particular class that includes a reference to goods that are classified in other classes. If an international application includes kits and/or gift baskets, and the identification of goods refers to items classified in more than one class, the IB is likely to issue a notice of irregularity requiring the applicant to separate the goods into their respective classes and to pay additional fees for added classes. To avoid issuance of a notice of irregularity by the IB, an international applicant may wish to either narrow the identification to refer only to items in a single international class, or submit additional fees for multiple international classes.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-3d139e2302">Although the IB determines <i>classification</i> of the goods/services, for purposes of <i>identification</i>, the examining attorney will examine the identification of goods/services in a §66(a) application according to the same standards of specificity used in examining applications under §§1 and 44 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051 and 1126. Specifically, the examining attorney must follow the procedures set forth in the TMEP and identify the goods/services in accordance with the USPTO’s <i>Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual</i> (“USPTO ID Manual”) whenever possible. However, with respect to requests for extension of protection to the U.S., the assigned classes define the scope of the goods/services for the purpose of determining the extent to which the identification may be amended in accordance with 37 C.F.R. §2.71.
</p>
<p id="ch1900_d1b1b1_191c3_149">When the IB is unable to determine if the classification assigned to particular goods/services by an applicant’s Office of origin is correct, the IB will request clarification. If no clarification is provided, the IB will include the unclear wording from the international application in the international registration and will indicate, in parentheses, that the wording is “considered too vague for classification,” “incomprehensible,” or “linguistically incorrect.” Although included in the listing of goods/services of the request for extension of protection, the parenthetical language is not part of the scope of the identification and must not be part of any application that is eventually approved for publication.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-4d139e2305">If the initial identification of goods/services in the §66(a) application is definite, but misclassified under United States standards, the examining attorney must accept the identification, and cannot change the classification. If the initial identification of goods/services is not definite, the classification cannot be changed and the scope of the identification for purposes of permissible amendment is limited by the IB-assigned classification.

. Because the international registration is limited to those classes assigned by the IB, the identification includes only those products or services falling within the identified classes. To propose an amendment outside of the scope of the classes would result in the lack of a basis for registration of such goods/services under U.S. law.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-3d139e2553">When the IB determines that there is an error concerning an international registration in the International Register, it corrects that error ex officio. Requests for correction may be submitted to the IB by the holder (i.e., a §66(a) applicant seeking protection in U.S.), the Office of Origin of the international application, or in some cases by the USPTO Administrator for Trademark Classification Policy and Practice.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-4d139e2556">Corrections that merely reclassify the originally identified goods/services may be accepted; however, any indefinite wording of the identification of such goods/services that was acceptably amended during the course of USPTO examination will remain as amended, that is, the amended wording is not affected or changed by the correction issued by the IB. When an applicant amends the identification of goods/services in a manner that is acceptable to the examining attorney, including voluntary deletion of goods/services, the amendment replaces all previous identifications, and thus restricts the scope of goods/services to that amended language.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-3d139e2568">The holder of an international registration may record a limitation of the good/services, which may affect some or all of the designated Contracting Parties. Article 9
<i>bis</i>(iii). Upon recordation, the IB will notify the USPTO if the U.S. is affected by the limitation. The recording of a limitation does not remove the goods/services concerned from the international registration, but simply narrows the goods/services for which the holder seeks protection in the particular countries affected.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-4d139e2571">A limitation may set forth particular goods/services narrower in scope than the goods/services as identified in the international registration. For example, if the international registration covers “clothing,” the holder may limit the goods to “sweaters and pants” with respect to the U.S. Upon notification by the IB, if the examining attorney considers that the change requested is not in fact a limitation but an expansion of the list of goods/services, or is otherwise unacceptable, then the USPTO may declare that the limitation has no effect in the United States. Common Regs. 27(5)(a)-(c). For example, if the goods are identified as “clothing” in the international registration, and the limitation specifies “sweaters and hair bows,” the examining attorney must refuse to apply the “hair bows” portion of the limitation to the request for extension of protection to the United States because it expands, rather than limits, the scope of the goods of the international registration.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-3d139e2595">To the extent that an amendment of the identification in a §66(a) application narrows or restricts the goods/services, an amendment is comparable to a limitation affecting only the United States. A limitation filed at the IB by the applicant clarifying the nature of the goods/services may render the identification of goods/services in the §66(a) application sufficiently definite. Nevertheless, if the examining attorney has issued an Office action requiring amendment of the identification of goods/services, a proper response to the Office action must be received in the allowed time period. Simply recording a limitation with the IB is not a response to an Office action. The applicant must file a response with the USPTO within six months of the date on which the USPTO issued the Office action, stating that the applicant has recorded a limitation that will resolve the outstanding issue(s).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-3d139e3003">When the IB determines that there is an error concerning an international registration in the International Register, it corrects that error <i>ex officio</i>. The IB will also correct an error at the request of the holder or the Office of Origin. Common Reg. 28(1). If the IB notifies the USPTO of a correction with regard to an international registration, the USPTO may declare in a notification to the IB that protection cannot, or can no longer, be granted to the international registration as corrected. Such a declaration must be sent to the IB within 18 months of notification of the correction. This may be done where there are grounds for refusal of the international registration as corrected which did not apply to the international registration as originally notified to the USPTO. Common Reg. 28(3).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-4d139e3006">Unlike limitations, which affect only the listing of goods and/or services, a correction can involve any element of the international registration, including the mark for which registration is sought, the effective filing date, or the claim of priority. Corrections are not to be treated as amendments from the applicant. They are also not responses to Office actions and do not toll the statutory response period.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-5d139e3009">If the MPU determines that a correction does have effect in the United States and does not require review by the examining attorney, the correction will be entered into the USPTO’s database. The MPU trademark specialist will update the prosecution history in the Trademark database to reflect that the processing of the correction has been completed.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-6d139e3013">If the MPU determines that review by the examining attorney is required, the MPU will notify the examining attorney of the correction and the examining attorney will determine whether the correction raises any new grounds for refusal or basis for a new requirement. If the examining attorney determines that the correction raises new issues, he or she must issue an Office action refusing registration or making the necessary requirements and indicating the reasons why, supported by evidence, where appropriate. The examining attorney must also notify the MPU that a new Office action has been issued, and the MPU will ensure that the IB is notified of the new grounds for refusal. The applicant may argue against the refusal or requirement, and, if such refusal or requirement is made final, file an appeal to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board or petition to the Director pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §2.146.

<i>Limitation Due to Partial Cancellation of International Registration</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-4d139e3037">When the USPTO receives notification from the IB that the international registration has been cancelled in part due to the ceasing of effect of the basic registration, the USPTO will partially cancel the pending request for extension of protection by limiting or removing the cancelled goods and/or services from the USPTO’s Trademark database. 15 U.S.C. §1141j(a); 37 C.F.R. §7.30. The MPU trademark specialist will determine what, if any, goods and/or services remain extended to the United States and narrow the listing of goods and/or services accordingly.

<i>Voluntary Limitation by Holder of International Registration</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-6d139e3044">Upon receipt of notification from the IB that a voluntary limitation of the list of goods/services may affect an extension of protection to the United States, the USPTO may declare that the limitation has no effect. Such a declaration must be sent to the IB within 18 months of notification of the limitation. The USPTO will indicate the reasons why the limitation has no effect, the corresponding essential provisions of the law, and whether the declaration is subject to review or appeal. Common Regs. 27(5)(a)-(c).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-7d139e3047">If the MPU determines that a limitation does have effect in the U.S., the limitation shall be entered into the Trademark database with respect to the goods/services as identified at the time of receipt of the notification of limitation.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-8d139e3050">If the MPU determines that review by the examining attorney is required, the MPU will notify the examining attorney, and the examining attorney will determine whether the limited goods/services are within the scope of the identification of goods/services as originally identified in the §66(a) application. For example, if the request for extension of protection originally lists goods as “clothing” in International Class 25, and the applicant submits a response to an Office action proposing to amend such goods to “clothing, namely pants, shirts, and dresses,” and the USPTO later receives a voluntary limitation that lists the goods as “clothing for women,” the consideration of scope is against the original identification of “clothing.” If it is determined that the limitation is not an expansion of the scope of the original listing, the limited goods/services will then be considered in light of any interim amendments proposed by the applicant during prosecution of the application. In the example above, the proposed wording “clothing, namely, pants, shirts, and dresses” will be further limited to “clothing <i>for women</i>, namely, pants, shirts, and dresses.” 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-9d139e3053">If the examining attorney determines that the limitation is not acceptable (e.g., because he or she determines that the change requested results in an extension rather than a limitation of the goods/services), he or she must issue an Office action refusing the limitation and indicating the reasons why the limitation is unacceptable. If the listing of goods/services is not an expansion of the original goods/services but is itself indefinite by USPTO standards (e.g., “clothing for women”), the examining attorney must issue a new requirement for a sufficiently definite identification and may supersede any previously issued requirement to the extent it remains outstanding at the time of examination of the limitation. If the examining attorney issues a new Office action relating to the limitation of goods/services, he/she must also notify the MPU, and the MPU will ensure that the IB is notified when a limitation is found to have no effect in the United States. The applicant may argue against the refusal of the limitation, and, if such refusal is made final, file an appeal to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board or petition to the Director pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §2.63(b).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-10d139e3056">If an Office action requiring only that the identification be amended is outstanding, it is possible that a limitation notice processed before the end of the response period would resolve the issue. If the examining attorney determines that the identification proposed in the limitation is acceptable and puts the application in condition for approval for publication, the examining attorney may issue a no-call examiner’s amendment that acknowledges receipt of the limitation and states that the requirement for a more definite identification is satisfied and may then approve the application for publication.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-11d139e3059">If a limitation results in the deletion of all goods/services identified in the §66(a) application, the application will be abandoned.

As noted above, the USPTO must notify the IB within 18 months of the date the IB sends the request for extension of protection to the USPTO of: (1) a notification of refusal based on the filing of an opposition; or (2) a notification of the possibility that an opposition may be filed after expiration of the 18-month period.

The USPTO will assign a new serial number, and will link the prosecution history of the cancelled extension of protection to the new “transformed” application. A notation of the serial number to which the cancelled extension of protection is transformed appears in the electronic record of the cancelled extension of protection, under “Other Information” in the Trademark database (in the “Transformed To” field). Similarly, a notation of the serial number of the cancelled request for extension of protection appears in the Trademark database for the new transformed application (in the “Transformed From” field).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-4d139e3324">The “transformed” application will have the same filing date as the cancelled extension of protection, that is: (1) the international registration date, if the request for extension of protection to the United States was made in the international application; or (2) the date of recordal of the subsequent designation with the IB, if the request for extension of protection to the United States was made in a subsequent designation. If the extension of protection was entitled to priority under §67 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1141g, the new application is entitled to the same priority.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-5d139e3327">If an examining attorney has already searched USPTO records for conflicting marks, the examining attorney assigned to the transformed application does not have to conduct a new search, since the effective filing date will not change. The examining attorney must either ensure that a copy of the search statement is placed in the electronic record of the transformed application, or enter a Note to the File in the record, indicating the date on which the search was conducted and the serial number of the §66(a) application in which the search statement is of record.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-6d139e3331">The examining attorney must require the applicant to submit a verified statement in support of the application that relates back to the filing date of the transformed application. See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e555">TMEP §804.02</a>
 regarding the essential allegations required to verify an application for registration of a mark under §1 or §44, and 

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e596">TMEP §804.04</a>
 regarding persons properly authorized to sign a verification on behalf of an applicant.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-7d139e3340">If it is unclear from the transformation request, the examining attorney must require the holder to clarify whether the holder seeks registration for all of the goods/services that were covered by the cancelled extension of protection.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-8d139e3343">Even if the mark in the extension of protection was already published or registered, republication will be required, due to the substitution of a new basis for registration. 37 C.F.R. §2.35(b)(2).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-9d139e3346">Generally, in examining a “transformed” application where the extension of protection was published or registered, the USPTO will only issue requirements or refusals related to the new §1 or §44 basis. However, in some cases, where a significant length of time has elapsed since the initial examination of the request for extension of protection, refusal of registration may be appropriate due to changed circumstances. For example, the mark may have become descriptive or generic as applied to the goods/services.

The period of continuous use on which an affidavit of incontestability may be based may begin no earlier than the date of issuance of the registered extension of protection, unless the holder owns a prior U.S. registration of the same mark for the same goods/services. 15 U.S.C. §1141m-n.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-4d139e3393">Legally, replacement takes place automatically, by operation of law. However, the USPTO will note the replacement in its records (and notify the IB accordingly) only if the holder of a registered extension of protection files a request that it do so. A request to note replacement of a United States national registration with a registered extension of protection must include:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li class="nobull">(1)  The serial number or registration number of the extension of protection to the United States (i.e., the §66(a) application or registered extension of protection);

<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-7d139e3426">The holder cannot file the request to note replacement of the United States national registration until the registration based on the request for extension of protection issues. If the original United States national registration is active on the date the registration based on the request for extension of protection issues, the USPTO will accept a request to note replacement that is not filed until after the United States national registration is cancelled or expired. However, if the original United States national registration is in the grace period for filing an affidavit of continued use under Section 8 or a combined affidavit of continued use and renewal under Sections 8 and 9, 15 U.S.C. §§1058, 1059, at the time the registered extension of protection issues, the USPTO will not note replacement unless the required affidavit is filed and accepted. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-8d139e3429">“Replacement” does not invalidate the United States national registration. The United States national registration remains on the register, with all the rights attaching to such a registration, as long as the holder renews the registration under §9 of the Trademark Act and files the necessary affidavits of use or excusable nonuse under §8 of the Trademark Act. 37 C.F.R. §7.29.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-3d139e3492">Generally, all requests to record changes to an international registration must be filed at the IB, because an extension of protection of an international registration remains part of the international registration even after registration in the United States. However, in the limited circumstance where the holder of an international registration makes a mistake in a document filed during prosecution in the USPTO that affects only the extension of protection to the United States, the registrant may request correction of the error pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §2.175. For example, if there was a minor typographical error in an amendment to the identification of goods in a §66(a) application, and the mark registered with such an error, the owner of the registration could request correction. If the USPTO grants the request, the USPTO will notify the IB of the change to the extension of protection to the United States.

If the IB notifies the USPTO of a correction of an international registration, the USPTO may declare in a notification to the IB that protection cannot, or can no longer, be granted to the international registration as corrected.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-5d139e3520">When a notification of correction received from the IB prior to registration is not acted upon in sufficient time or is received too late to withdraw the application from issuance of a registration, the resulting registration generally will be treated as inadvertently issued. However, to the extent possible given the nature of the correction, the holder will be given the opportunity to keep the registration as issued and the USPTO will create a child application for any corrected goods/services/classes. The USPTO will notify the holder via the last correspondence address of record as to the receipt of the correction and the options for processing. To the extent a correction involves issues that cannot be handled by the creation of a child application, such as a material alteration of the mark, the registration will be cancelled as inadvertently issued and examined in accordance with Office policy and procedures.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-6d139e3524">When a notification of correction is received after the USPTO has issued a registered extension of protection, the correction will be reviewed in the MPU to determine if the registration may be corrected, as no republication would be required to implement the correction. When the correction would not trigger a requirement for republication, the MPU will make the correction and schedule the issuance of an updated registration certificate, as necessary.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1900-7d139e3527">If the MPU determines that entry of the correction would require further examination, the holder will be given the opportunity to keep the registration as issued and to divide any corrected goods, services, and/or classes affected into a child application pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §2.87.
