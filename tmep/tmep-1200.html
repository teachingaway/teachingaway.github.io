                                 relationship between Wella U.S. and Wella A.G. is not, in itself, a basis
                                 for finding that any “WELLA” product emanating from either of the two
                                 companies emanates from the same source. Besides the existence of a legal
                                 relationship, there must also be a unity of control over the use of the
                                 trademarks. “Control” and “source” are inextricably linked. If,
                                 notwithstanding the legal relationship between entities, each entity
                                 exclusively controls the nature and quality of the goods to which it applies
                                 one or more of the various “WELLA” trademarks, the two entities are in fact
                                 separate sources. Wella A.G. has made of record a declaration of the
                                 executive vice president of Wella U.S., which declaration states that Wella
                                 A.G. owns substantially all the outstanding stock of Wella U.S. and “thus
                                 controls the activities and operations of Wella U.S., including the
                                 selection, adoption and use of the trademarks.” While the declaration
                                 contains no details of how this control is exercised, the declaration is
                                 sufficient, absent contradictory evidence in the record, to establish that
                                 control over the use of all the “WELLA” trademarks in the United States
                                 resides in a single source.

                              affirmatively asserts that a §2(d) refusal is inappropriate because the

                              single source, or the applicant raises an equivalent argument. Examining
                              attorneys should issue §2(d) refusals in any case where an analysis of the marks
                              and the goods or services of the respective parties indicates a bar to
                              registration under §2(d). The examining attorney should not attempt to analyze
                              the relationship between an applicant and registrant until an applicant, in some
                              form, relies on the nature of the relationship to obviate a refusal under

                                 demonstrate unity of control, some relationships, by their very nature,
                                 contradict any claim that unity of control is present. For instance, if the
                                 relationship between the parties is that of licensor and licensee, unity of
                                 control will ordinarily not be present. The licensing relationship suggests
                                 ownership in one party and control by that one party over only the use of a
                                 specific mark or marks, but not over the operations or activities of the
                                 licensee generally. Thus, there is no unity of control and no basis for
                                 concluding that the two parties form a single source. Precisely because
                                 unity of control is absent, a licensing agreement is necessary. The
                                 licensing agreement enables the licensor/owner to control specific
                                 activities to protect its interests as the sole source or sponsor of the
                                 goods or services provided under the mark. Therefore, in these situations,
                                 it is most unlikely that an applicant could establish unity of control to
                                 overcome a §2(d) refusal.

                                    prevents trademark law, which seeks to promote competition by protecting
                                    a firm’s reputation, from instead inhibiting legitimate competition by
                                    allowing a producer to control a useful product feature. It is the
                                    province of patent law, not trademark law, to encourage invention by
                                    granting inventors a monopoly over new product designs or functions for
                                    a limited time, 35 U.S.C. Sections 154, 173, after which competitors are
                                    free to use the innovation. If a product’s functional features could be
                                    used as trademarks, however, a monopoly over such features could be
                                    obtained without regard to whether they qualify as patents and could be
                                    extended forever (because trademarks may be renewed in

                                 the potentially unlimited protection of a trademark registration. Upon
                                 expiration of a utility patent, the invention covered by the patent enters
                                 the public domain, and the functional features disclosed in the patent may
                                 then be copied by others – thus encouraging advances in product design and

                                 the utility of each separate feature does not establish that the overall

                                    of a design patent does not in itself establish that a product feature
                                    is nonfunctional, and can be outweighed by other evidence supporting the
                                    functionality determination.

                                 sought to be registered is functional will result in a functionality refusal
                                 under §2(e)(5). Use of the term “aesthetic functionality” may be appropriate
                                 in limited circumstances where the proposed mark presents issues similar to

                                 discussed above – i.e., where the issue is one of true functionality under

                                 determination turn on evidence of particular competitive advantages that are
                                 not necessarily categorized as “utilitarian” in nature. Any such use of the
                                 term “aesthetic functionality” should be closely tied to a discussion of
                                 specific competitive advantages resulting from use of the proposed mark at
                                 issue, so that it is clear that the refusal is properly based on the
                                 functionality doctrine and not on an incorrect use of “aesthetic
                                 functionality” to mean ornamentation.

                                 three-dimensional design or configuration of the product itself. In such
                                 cases, the drawing usually depicts the item listed in the identification of
                                 goods (e.g., the drawing shows a three-dimensional design of a guitar and
                                 the goods are “guitars”). However, sometimes the identification of
                                 goods/services in a product-design application includes different or
                                 unrelated products or services that are, on their face, inconsistent with
                                 the product design depicted on the drawing (e.g., the drawing shows a
                                 three-dimensional design of a guitar and the identification includes “drums
                                 and pianos” or “retail music stores”). This presents an issue of
                                 “inconsistent goods.” In rare cases, slight variations are acceptable if the
                                 products have a “consistent overall look” such that the changes do not alter
                                 the distinctive characteristics and the trade dress conveys a “single and
                                 continuing” commercial impression.

                                 color(s) used on liquids or powders. For example, the mark might consist of
                                 fuchsia body oil or red, white, and blue granular washing machine detergent.
                                 In these cases, the nature of the drawing will depend on the manner of use
                                 of the liquid or powder. If the liquid or powder is visible through the
                                 product package, the drawing should consist of the shape of the product
                                 package shown in broken or dotted lines, with the description of the mark
                                 identifying the color(s) of the liquid or powder.

                                 services because there are a myriad of ways that color can be used in
                                 connection with services. However, the following general guidelines will be
                                 used to determine the sufficiency of drawings in these

                                    color in the abstract. Rather, the mark consists of color used in a
                                    particular manner, and the context in which the color is used is
                                    critical to provide notice of the nature of the mark sought to be

                                    supplemented with a written description of the mark, is
                                    required.

                                 of others. The “goods” actually are magazines-not sections of magazines.
                                 When the magazine is purchased, the purchaser receives the sections whether
                                 he wants them or not, and it is doubtful that magazine readers

                                 other than as a part of an integrated whole; and we must therefore be
                                 concerned with whether a section title actually identifies and
                                 distinguishes, and if so, what it distinguishes. Under these circumstances
                                 it becomes necessary to ask: Was the mark adopted to identify a section of
                                 applicant’s magazine and distinguish it from sections of other publishers’
                                 magazines, or was it adopted to distinguish one section of applicant’s
                                 magazine from the other sections of its magazine?

                              single creative works. Creative works that are serialized, i.e., the mark

                              still considered single creative works. A theatrical performance is also a
                              single creative work, because the content of the play, musical, opera, or
                              similar production does not significantly change from one performance to
                              another.

                           <p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e4052">Generally, any creative work will not
                              be considered a single creative work if evidence exists that it is part of a
                              series (e.g., the work is labeled “volume 1,” “part 1,” or “book 1”) or is a
                              type of work in which the content changes with each issue or performance. For
                              example, single creative works do not include periodically issued publications,
                              such as magazines, newsletters, comic books, comic strips, guide books, and
                              printed classroom materials, because the content of these works changes with
                              each issue.

                              <i>significantly</i> is not
                              regarded as a single creative work. For example, a statement on the jacket cover
                              that a cookbook is a “new and revised” version would indicate that it includes
                              significant revisions. However, a new edition issued to correct typographical
                              errors or that makes only minor changes is not considered to be a new work. Live
                              performances by musical bands, television and radio series, and educational
                              seminars are presumed to change with each presentation and, therefore, are not
                              single creative works.

                                 designations, the examining attorney must determine whether to make an
                                 additional refusal on the grounds that the mark is also merely descriptive
                                 of the goods. Trademark Act §2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §§1052(e)(1). Grade
                                 designations can often become synonymous with (and thus merely descriptive
                                 of) a classification, value, size, weight, type, degree, mode of
                                 manufacturing, or level of quality of the goods. Grade designations that are
                                 also the generic name of the goods are not eligible for registration on the
                                 Principal Register under §2(f) or on the Supplemental Register because they
                                 are not capable of indicating the source of the goods and must remain
                                 available to identify the relevant characteristic possessed by goods meeting
                                 such criteria. In such cases, if the applicant responds by amending the
                                 application to seek registration on the Supplemental Register, the examining
                                 attorney must issue a generic refusal under §23. In the rare situation where
                                 the applicant is the sole user of a grade designation and where the mark
                                 appears capable, the applicant should be provided with the same response

                                 ribbon, for example, has become the universal symbol of breast cancer
                                 awareness. This symbol appears in connection with the charity activities of

                                 is more likely that consumers, upon encountering the pink ribbon symbol on a

                                 particular context or use. For instance, evidence may support the conclusion
                                 that, when a pink ribbon is displayed on the packaging for a household
                                 appliance, the ribbon would likely be viewed as indicating that the product
                                 has some connection to a breast cancer-related cause (e.g., some portion of
                                 the proceeds from the sale of the appliance would go towards breast cancer
                                 research). Or evidence may establish that the pink ribbon symbol displayed
                                 on a shirt would be viewed as conveying the message that the wearer is a
                                 supporter of breast cancer survivors or breast cancer causes in general.
                                 Even when an awareness ribbon symbol features a particular color, color
                                 scheme, or pattern that is not commonly used or widely recognized, the

                              deceptiveness, the examining attorney must provide sufficient evidence that the
                              misdescriptive quality or characteristic would be a material factor in the
                              purchasing decision of a significant portion of the relevant consumers. To do
                              so, the examining attorney must provide evidence that the misdescriptive quality

                                 examples (not a comprehensive list) of the type of objective criteria that
                                 should be used to analyze whether a term is a material factor. The evidence
                                 may often point to more than one characteristic, thereby strengthening the
                                 examining attorney’s prima facie case. For example, the evidence may show
                                 that goods deemed “organic” because they are produced in compliance with
                                 objective criteria can also be more costly, provide health benefits, and

                                 inducement to purchase supports a presumption that a significant portion of
                                 the relevant consumers would likely be deceived.

                              <p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e5427">Generally, an applicant may avoid
                                 or overcome a deceptiveness refusal by amending the identification of goods
                                 or services, if accurate, to include the potentially deceptive term. For
                                 deceptiveness refusals based on the material composition of the goods, if
                                 the applicant amends the identification to include the potentially deceptive
                                 term, the USPTO will rely on the presumption that the goods contain a
                                 sufficient amount of the material to obviate deceptiveness; there is no
                                 requirement to substantiate the amount or percentage of the material or
                                 feature in the goods. Thus, the applicant may amend “ties” to “silk ties,”
                                 “milk and cheese” to “organic milk and cheese,” and “jewelry” to “gold
                                 jewelry” or to “jewelry made in whole or significant part of

                                 amount of the named ingredient/material composition to meet the standard for
                                 use of the term in the relevant industry. In the case of "coats made in
                                 significant part of leather," such wording would be construed to mean that
                                 the "coats" contain a sufficient amount of leather to be called "leather
                                 coats" in the relevant industry. However, the wording "coats made in part of
                                 leather" is not acceptable because, although the goods may contain some
                                 leather, it may not be an amount sufficient for the goods to be called
                                 “leather coats” in the relevant industry.

                           refused in a particular application, the examining attorney should consult the
                           relevant statute to determine the function of the designation and its appropriate
                           use. If a statute provides that a specific party or government agency has the
                           exclusive right to use a designation, and a party other than that specified in the
                           statute has applied to register the designation, the examining attorney must refuse

                                 Swiss coat of arms or a simulation thereof. For example, the drawing may
                                 show a white cross on a red triangular shield. Or, if the mark drawing is

                                 applicant’s use of the mark. Examining attorneys are not required to search

                                    §§1 and 45, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1127, in support of the refusal and

                                    refusal will be issued not because information in the application

                                    would lead to the impression that a non-color cross-and-shield design is
                                    the Swiss coat of arms. In these instances, a refusal under §§1 and 45

                              the purpose of publishing coin collecting publications; was subsequently

                              subject around the country; received awards from national coin- and

                              fields; was the founder of a car show and swap meet; and had his large

                              established that the petitioner was publicly connected with the fields of coin
                              collecting, car collecting, and publishing activities relating thereto, such

                              dismissed because petitioner had not demonstrated that he was publicly connected

                                 examining attorney introduced evidence from several sources discussing the
                                 practice of some restaurants to offer private label or house brands of beer;
                                 evidence that brewpubs who brew their own beer often feature restaurant
                                 services; and copies of several third-party registrations showing that a
                                 single mark had been registered for both beer and restaurants services. 343
                                 F.3d at 1345, 68 USPQ2d at 1063. However, applicant countered with evidence
                                 that while there are about 1,450 brewpubs and microbreweries in the United
                                 States, there are over 800,000 restaurants, which means that brewpubs and
                                 microbreweries account for only about 18 one-hundredths of one percent of
                                 all restaurants.

                                 that “[t]here was no contrary evidence introduced on those points,” the
                                 court found that:

                                 <p id="TMEP-ch-1200-1d105e8198">While there was evidence that
                                    some restaurants sell private label beer, that evidence did not suggest
                                    that such restaurants are numerous. And although the Board had before it
                                    a few registrations for both restaurant services and beer, the very
                                    small number of such dual use registrations does nothing to counter
                                    Coors’ showing that only a very small percentage of restaurants actually
                                    brew their own beer or sell house brands of beer; instead, the small
                                    number of such registrations suggests that it is quite uncommon for
                                    restaurants and beer to share the same trademark. Thus, the evidence
                                    before the Board indicates not that there is a substantial overlap
                                    between restaurant services and beer with respect to source, but rather
                                    that the degree of overlap between the sources of restaurant services
                                    and the sources of beer is 
                                    <i>de minimis</i>. We therefore
                                    disagree with the Board’s legal conclusion that Coors’ beer and the
                                    registrant’s restaurant services are sufficiently related to support a
                                    finding of a likelihood of confusion.

                                 confusion between marks is that marks must be compared in their entireties
                                 and must be considered in connection with the particular goods or services
                                 for which they are used. It follows from that principle that likelihood of
                                 confusion cannot be predicated on dissection of a mark, that is, on only
                                 part of a mark. On the other hand, in articulating reasons for reaching a
                                 conclusion on the issue of confusion, there is nothing improper in stating
                                 that, for rational reasons, more or less weight has been given to a
                                 particular feature of a mark, provided the ultimate conclusion rests on
                                 consideration of the marks in their entireties. Indeed, this type of
                                 analysis appears to be unavoidable.

                                 confusion between compound word marks, one must determine whether a portion
                                 of the word mark is dominant in terms of creating the commercial impression.
                                 The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has noted that “in articulating
                                 reasons for reaching a conclusion on the issue of confusion, there is
                                 nothing improper in stating that, for rational reasons, more or less weight
                                 has been given to a particular feature of a mark, provided the ultimate
                                 conclusion rests on consideration of the marks in their entireties.”

                                 a “dominant” element of a compound word mark, consumers would be more likely
                                 to perceive a fanciful or arbitrary term, rather than a descriptive or
                                 generic term, as the source-indicating feature of the mark.

                           registration of a mark that so resembles a mark previously registered by another, or
                           for the registration of which another has previously applied, as to be likely, when
                           used on or in connection with the goods or services of the applicant, to cause

                              result in a party being unduly prejudiced in the absence of an interference. 37
                              C.F.R. §2.91(a). The availability of opposition and cancellation procedures
                              provides a remedy and ordinarily precludes the possibility of undue prejudice to
                              a party. 
                              <i>Id</i>. The request for interference must show that
                              there is some extraordinary circumstance that would make the remedy of
                              opposition or cancellation inadequate or prejudicial to the party’s rights.

                              (Comm’r Pats. 1974). The potential need to file two notices of opposition that
                              could be consolidated if the issues were sufficiently similar is not considered
                              an extraordinary circumstance that will unduly prejudice a petitioner without an
                              interference. The fact that an earlier-filed application based on §1(b), §44, or
                              §66(a) has been cited against a later-filed application based on use in commerce
                              under §1(a) also is not an extraordinary circumstance that warrants declaration
                              of an interference. An opposition proceeding is the proper forum for determining
                              priority between an applicant and another party. Priority for purposes of
                              examination of an application is determined by filing date. 37 C.F.R. §2.83(a);

                           be determined only by considering it in relation to the specific goods or services.

                              <p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e13129">When terms such as “AMERICA,”
                                 “AMERICAN,” and “USA” appear in marks, determining whether the term or the
                                 entire mark should be considered geographic can be particularly difficult.
                                 There is no simple or mechanical answer to the question of how to treat
                                 “AMERICA” or “AMERICAN” in a mark. The examining attorney must evaluate each
                                 mark on a case-by-case basis. The examining attorney must consider the
                                 entire context, the type of goods or services at issue, the geographic
                                 origin of the goods or services and, most importantly, the overall
                                 commercial impression engendered by the mark at issue. The following
                                 principles, developed in the case law, should provide guidance in reaching a
                                 judgment in a given case.

                                 of this test – the services-place association – requires some consideration.
                                 A customer typically receives services, particularly in the restaurant
                                 business, at the location of the business. Having chosen to come to that
                                 place for the services, the customer is well aware of the geographic
                                 location of the service. This choice necessarily implies that the customer
                                 is less likely to associate the services with the geographic location
                                 invoked by the mark rather than the geographic location of the service, such
                                 as a restaurant. In this case, the customer is less likely to identify the

                                 operates somewhat differently than a goods-place association…. In a case
                                 involving goods, the goods-place association often requires little more than
                                 a showing that the consumer identifies the place as a known source of the
                                 product [citations omitted]. Thus, to make a goods-place association, the
                                 case law permits an inference that the consumer associates the product with
                                 the geographic location in the mark because that place is known for
                                 producing the product. [citation omitted] In the case of a services-place
                                 association, however, a mere showing that the geographic location in the
                                 mark is known for performing the service is not sufficient. Rather the
                                 second prong of the test requires some additional reason for the consumer to

                           be an anonymous producer, since consumers often buy goods without knowing the

                                 purposes of avoiding a disclaimer, a claim of §2(f) in part would generally
                                 not be appropriate since the elements are so merged together that they

                        <p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e17882">There was no statutory authority for
                           disclaimer prior to 1946. As various court decisions were rendered, USPTO practice
                           fluctuated from, first, registering the composite mark without a qualifying
                           statement; later, requiring a statement in the application disclaiming the
                           unregistrable matter in the mark; and, finally, requiring removal of the
                           unregistrable matter from the mark on the drawing. This fluctuation ended with the
                           decision of 
                           <i>Estate of P.D. Beckwith, Inc. v. Comm’r of Pats.</i>, 252
                           U.S. 538 (1920), in which the United States Supreme Court held that to require the
                           removal of descriptive matter from a composite mark was erroneous, and commended the
                           practice of a statement of disclaimer. Thus, the practice of disclaimer was
                           established officially in the USPTO, although still without statutory
                           support.

                              require unregistrable matter to be disclaimed. Under the impetus of the
                              mandatory word “shall,” it became customary to require a disclaimer for every
                              occurrence, in any type of combination, of every term or symbol which by itself
                              might be refused registration in the first instance under the 1946

                              unregistrable component of a mark otherwise registrable. The change from “shall”
                              to “may” justifies the exercise of greater discretion by examining attorneys in
                              determining whether a disclaimer is necessary.

                              mind the basic purpose of disclaimers, which is to indicate in the record that a

                              composite. The examining attorney must not require that an element of a mark be
                              disclaimed when a disclaimer would be unnecessary, e.g., when the form or degree
                              of integration of an element in the composite makes it obvious that no claim is
                              being made in any element apart from the composite.

                           “unitary” when it creates a commercial impression separate and apart from any
                           unregistrable component. The test for unitariness inquires whether the elements of a
                           mark are so integrated or merged together that they cannot be regarded as separable.

                           marketing of such goods and also ... what the reaction of the average purchaser
                           would be to this display of the mark.”

                           single and distinct commercial impression.

                                    confused with the significance of punctuation in a mark containing

                              otherwise unregistrable. For example, if a mark is comprised entirely of generic

                              the generic wording, the entire mark may not be disclaimed, even in the proper

                              about another matter, the examining attorney must state in the Office action
                              that the disclaimer appears to be unnecessary, and inquire as to whether the
                              applicant wants to withdraw the disclaimer. If it is otherwise unnecessary to
                              communicate with the applicant, the inquiry may be made by telephone or e-mail.
                              If the applicant wants to delete the disclaimer, this may be done by examiner’s
                              amendment. If the applicant does not respond promptly to the telephone or e-mail

                              enter an appropriate Note to the File in the record. Again, the disclaimer does
                              not render an otherwise unregistrable mark registrable. The examining attorney

                              whether the entire mark is registrable.

                           refusal of registration, the Federal Circuit noted that under §22 of the Trademark
                           Act, 15 U.S.C. §1072, registration serves as constructive notice to the public of
                           the registrant’s ownership of the mark and, therefore, precludes another user from
                           claiming innocent misappropriation as a trademark infringement defense. To make this
                           constructive notice meaningful, the mark as registered must accurately reflect the
                           mark that is used in commerce, so that someone who searches the register for a
                           similar mark will locate the registration. The court stated that “phantom marks”
                           with missing elements “encompass too many combinations and permutations to make a
                           thorough and effective search possible” and, therefore, the registration of these
                           marks does not provide adequate notice to competitors and the public.

                           U.S.C. §1051(c), or a statement of use under §1(d) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051(d),

                           domain name, neither the beginning of the URL (“http://www.”) nor the gTLD has any
                           source-indicating significance. Instead, those designations are merely devices that
                           every Internet site provider must use as part of its address. Advertisements for all

                           advertiser, and the average person familiar with the Internet recognizes the format
                           for a domain name and understands that “http,” “www,” and a gTLD are a part of every

                           for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) authorized the launch of a program to
                           introduce new gTLDs. Some of the gTLDs under consideration may have significance as
                           source identifiers. To the extent that some of the new gTLDs under consideration
                           comprise existing registered trademarks or service marks that are already strong
                           source identifiers in other fields of use, some of the premises mentioned above may
                           no longer hold true for such gTLDs (e.g., a gTLD consisting of a coined mark is not
                           an abbreviation of an entity type or class of intended user of domain space). Where
                           the wording following the “.” or “dot” is already used as a trademark or service
                           mark, the appearance of such marks as a gTLD may not negate the consumer perception
                           of them as source indicators. Accordingly, in some circumstances, a gTLD may have

                                 In other words, the asserted mark WWW.EILBERG.COM merely indicates the
                                 location on the Internet where applicant’s Web site appears. It does not
                                 separately identify applicant’s legal services as such.

                              ABC.COM or HTTP://WWW.ABC.COM), consumers generally look to the second-level
                              domain name for source identification, not to the generic top-level domain
                              (gTLD) or the terms “http://www.” or “www.” Therefore, it is usually acceptable
                              to depict only the second-level domain name on the drawing page, even if the
                              specimen shows a mark that includes a traditional gTLD (such as .COM) or the
                              terms “http://www.” or “www.” However, if the mark depicted in the specimen
                              includes a gTLD that serves a source-indicating function, the drawing of record
                              must include such source-indicating gTLD.

                              trademark because consumers are predisposed to view gTLDs as merely a portion of

                              mark. However, the applicant may, in some circumstances, avoid or overcome the
                              refusal by providing evidence that the mark will be perceived as a source
                              identifier. In addition, the applicant must show that: (1) it has entered into a
                              currently valid Registry Agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned
                              Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) designating the applicant as the Registry Operator
                              for the gTLD identified by the mark and (2) the identified services will be
                              primarily for the benefit of others.

                           <p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e20051">Generally, an applicant may add or
                              delete a non-source-identifying gTLD to/from the drawing of a domain name mark
                              (e.g., COOPER amended to COPPER.COM, or COOPER.COM amended to COOPER) without
                              materially altering the mark. Although a mark that includes a gTLD generally
                              will be perceived by the public as a domain name, while a mark without a gTLD
                              will not, if the gTLD merely indicates the type of entity using the domain name,
                              the essence of the mark is created by the second-level domain name, not the
                              gTLD. Thus, the commercial impression created by the second-level domain name
                              usually remains the same whether the non-source-identifying gTLD is present or
                              not. If the gTLD does function as a source indicator, its deletion from the
                              domain name mark may constitute a material alteration of the
                              mark.

                        civil litigation between the parties prohibits the applicant from using or registering

                        since the prior decision in that: (1) the Court did not explicitly consider the “curved
                        front edge” of the design in the prior decision; (2) there had been a change in the
                        legal standard for functionality, in view of the Supreme Court’s decision in

                        USPQ2d 1001 (2001); and (3) applicant had "presented additional evidence, such as the
                        absence of promotional material that ‘touts’ the utilitarian aspects of the mark." The
                        Court rejected these arguments, noting that it had acknowledged in the prior decision
                        that the design includes a “bowed front edge,” and “bowed” is simply another term for
                        “curved;” that

                        that the focus on advertising materials, which do not promote the utilitarian aspects of
                        the curved front edge, is not relevant because the proposed mark is an entire
                        pentagonal-shaped design and not merely the curved front edge, and the promotional
                        advertisements submitted in the earlier case “did clearly promote the functional reason
