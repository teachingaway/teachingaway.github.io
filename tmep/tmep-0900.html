<p id="TMEP-ch-900-3d90e18">In an application based on use in commerce under §1(a) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051(a), the applicant must use the mark in commerce on or in connection with all the goods and services listed in the application as of the application filing date.  
<i>See</i> 37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(1)(i).  The application must include a statement that the mark is in use in commerce, verified in an affidavit or declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20.  If the verification is not filed with the original application, it must also allege that the mark was in use in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services listed in the application as of the application filing date.  37 C.F.R. §2.34(a)(1)(i).  See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e450">TMEP §§804</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e33">In an application based on “intent-to-use” under §1(b) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051(b), the applicant typically begins use in commerce after the filing date.  The application must include a verified statement that the applicant has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services listed in the application as of the application filing date.  Prior to registration, the applicant must actually use the mark in commerce on or in connection with all the goods or services specified in the application and file an allegation of use (i.e., either an amendment to allege use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(c) or a statement of use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(d)).  
<i>See</i>

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-6d90e54">Applicants relying <i>solely</i> on a foreign registration as the basis for registration under §44(e) of the Trademark Act are not required to assert actual use of the mark prior to registration in the United States.

.  
<i>See Crocker National Bank v.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-900d1e54">901.01   Definitions  </h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-3d90e92">The power of the federal government to register marks comes from the commerce clause of the Constitution.  Section 1 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051, permits application for registration of “a trademark used in commerce” (15 U.S.C. §1051(a)) or of a trademark that a person has a bona fide intention to use in commerce (15 U.S.C. §1051(b)).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e95">Section 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1127, defines “commerce” as “all commerce which may lawfully be regulated by Congress.”  Section 45 defines “use in commerce” as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-1d90e100">The term “use in commerce” means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark.  For purposes of this Act, a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce--

<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-900d1e72">901.02   Bona Fide Use in the Ordinary Course of Trade</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-3d90e148">The definition of use in commerce (

<a href="tmep-0900.html#TMEP-900d1e54">TMEP §901.01</a>
) was amended by the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988 (TLRA), Public Law 100-667, 102 Stat. 3935, to add the phrase “the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark.”  The primary purpose of the amendment was to eliminate the practice of “token use,” or use made solely to reserve rights in a mark.  
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e154">The legislative history of the TLRA makes it clear that the meaning of “use in the ordinary course of trade” will vary from one industry to another.  The report of the House Judiciary Committee stated that:
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-1d90e159">While use made merely to reserve a right in a mark will not meet this standard, the Committee recognizes that “the ordinary course of trade” varies from industry to industry.  Thus, for example, it might be in the ordinary course of trade for an industry that sells expensive or seasonal products to make infrequent sales.  Similarly, a pharmaceutical company that markets a drug to treat a rare disease will make correspondingly few sales in the ordinary course of its trade; the company’s shipment to clinical investigators during the Federal approval process will also be in its ordinary course of trade....
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-6d90e164">H.R. Rep. No. 1028, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. 15 (1988).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-7d90e167">The report of the Senate Judiciary Committee stated:
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-1d90e172">The committee intends that the revised definition of “use in commerce” be interpreted flexibly so as to encompass various genuine, but less traditional, trademark uses, such as those made in test markets, infrequent sales of large or expensive items, or ongoing shipments of a new drug to clinical investigators by a company awaiting FDA approval....
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-9d90e176">S. Rep. No. 515, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. 44-45 (1988).  
<i>See also Paramount Pictures Corp. v. White,</i> 31 USPQ2d 1768, 1774 n.8 (TTAB 1994), <i>aff’d,</i> 108 F.3d 1392 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-10d90e185">Therefore, some factors to consider when determining compliance with the statutory requirement for a “bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade” are:  (1) the amount of use; (2) the nature or quality of the transaction; and (3) what is typical use within a particular industry. <i>See Automedx Inc. v. Artivent Corp.,</i> 95 USPQ2d 1976 (TTAB 2010) (finding sales of demonstration models of portable medical ventilators to military constituted bona fide use of mark in commerce); <i>see also</i>
<i>Clorox Co. v. Salazar</i>, 108 USPQ2d 1083, 1086 (TTAB 2013) (finding that applicant had not made bona fide use of its mark in commerce, as applicant had not sold or transported goods bearing the mark in commerce as of the application filing date).

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-900d1e98">901.03   Commerce That May Be Lawfully Regulated By Congress</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-3d90e197">The scope of federal trademark jurisdiction is commerce that may be regulated by the United States Congress.  The types of commerce encompassed in this definition are interstate, territorial, and between the United States and a foreign country.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e200">“Territorial commerce” is commerce within a territory of the United States (e.g., Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, or the United States Virgin Islands) or between the United States and a territory of the United States.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-5d90e203">Purely intrastate use does not provide a basis for federal registration.  However, if intrastate use directly affects a type of commerce that Congress may regulate, this constitutes use in commerce within the meaning of the Act.  
<i>See Larry Harmon Pictures Corp. v. Williams Restaurant Corp.,</i> 929 F.2d 662, 18 USPQ2d 1292 (Fed. Cir. 1991), <i>cert. denied</i>502 U.S. 823 (1991) (mark used to identify restaurant services rendered at a single-location restaurant serving interstate travelers is in “use in commerce”);
<i> In re Silenus Wines, Inc.,</i> 557 F.2d 806, 194 USPQ 261 (C.C.P.A. 1977) (intrastate sale of imported wines by importer constitutes “use in commerce,” where goods bearing labels supplied by applicant were shipped to applicant in United States); <i>In re Gastown, Inc.</i>, 326 F.2d 780, 140 USPQ 216 (C.C.P.A. 1964) (automotive service station located in one state was rendering services “in commerce” because services were available to customers travelling interstate on federal highways); <i>U.S. Shoe Corp. v. J. Riggs West, Inc.,</i> 221 USPQ 1020, 1022 (TTAB 1984) (billiard parlor services satisfy the “use in commerce” requirements, where the record showed that applicant’s billiard parlor services were advertised in both Kansas and New York);
<i> In re G.J. Sherrard Co.,</i> 150 USPQ 311 (TTAB 1966) (hotel located in only one state has valid use of its service mark in commerce because it has out-of-state guests, has offices in many states, and advertises in national magazines);
<i> In re Federated Department Stores, Inc.,</i> 137 USPQ 670 (TTAB 1963) (mark used to identify retail department store services located in one state was in use in commerce, where the mark was used on credit cards issued to out-of-state residents, and on catalogs and advertisements shipped to out-of-state customers).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-6d90e229">In some cases, services such as restaurant and hotel services have been deemed to be rendered in commerce because they are activities that have been found to be within the scope of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which, like the Trademark Act, is predicated on the commerce clause.  
<i>See In re Ponderosa Motor Inns, Inc.,</i> 156 USPQ 474 (TTAB 1968);
<i> In re Smith Oil Corp.,</i> 156 USPQ 62 (TTAB 1967).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-7d90e238">The term “foreign” is not acceptable to specify the type of commerce in which a mark is used, because it does not clearly indicate that the mark is in use in a type of commerce that Congress can lawfully regulate.  Unless the “foreign commerce” involves the United States, Congress does not have the power to regulate it.  Use of a mark in a foreign country does not give rise to rights in the United States if the goods or services are not sold or rendered in the United States.  
<i>Buti v. Impressa Perosa S.R.L.</i>, 139 F.3d 98, 45 USPQ2d 1985 (2nd Cir. 1998); <i>Mother’s Restaurants Inc. v. Mother’s Bakery, Inc.,</i> 498 F. Supp. 847, 210 USPQ 207 (W.D.N.Y. 1980); <i>Linville v. Rivard,</i>41 USPQ2d 1731 (TTAB 1996), <i>aff’d,</i> 133 F.3d 1446, 45 USPQ2d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <i>Aktieselskabet</i>

Winkelmann</i>, 90 USPQ2d 1660 (TTAB 2009) (“[T]he evidence that applicant relies upon through its foreign registrations and Internet printouts does not demonstrate trademark use for the claimed goods.  Further, these documents do not show that applicant has an intent to use the mark in the United States.”)
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-8d90e262">Offering services via the Internet has been held to constitute use in commerce, since the services are available to a national and international audience who must use interstate telephone lines to access a website.  
<i>See Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. v. Bucci</i>, 42 USPQ2d 1430 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), <i>aff'd,</i> 152 F.3d 920 (2d Cir. 1998) (Table), <i>cert. denied</i>, 525 U.S. 834 (1998).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-9d90e274">An applicant is not required to specify the type of commerce in which the mark is used.  The USPTO presumes that an applicant who states that the mark is in use in commerce is stating that the mark is in use in a type of commerce that Congress can regulate, unless there is contradictory evidence in the record.  See <a href="tmep-0900.html#TMEP-900d1e177">TMEP §901.04</a>
 regarding the circumstances where an examining attorney should inquire as to whether the mark is in use in commerce that can be regulated by Congress.
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-900d1e177">901.04   Inquiry Regarding Use in Commerce</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-3d90e292">It is the responsibility of the applicant and the applicant’s attorney to determine whether an assertion of use in commerce is supported by the relevant facts.  The validity of an applicant’s assertion of use in commerce generally does not arise in ex parte examination.  The examining attorney will normally accept the applicant’s verified claim of use in commerce without investigation into whether the use referred to constitutes “use in commerce.”
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e295">An applicant is not required to specify the type of commerce in which the mark is used.  
<i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-0900.html#TMEP-900d1e98">TMEP §901.03</a>
.  However, if the applicant specifically states that the mark is in use in commerce that cannot be regulated by Congress (e.g., “intrastate commerce” or “foreign commerce”), the applicant has not met the statutory requirement for a verified statement that the mark is in use in commerce, and a specification of the date of first use in commerce, as defined in §45 of the Trademark Act.  Accordingly, the examining attorney must advise the applicant that it appears that the mark is not in use in a type of commerce that can be regulated by Congress and must require that the applicant either submit a verified statement that “the mark is in use in commerce that can be regulated by Congress,” or amend the basis of the application to a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce under §1(b) of the Act, if permitted by 37 C.F.R. §2.35.  See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e861">TMEP §806.03(c)</a>
 regarding amendment of the basis from §1(a) to §1(b).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-5d90e310">If the application record contains evidence or information indicating that the mark may not be in use in commerce that “may lawfully be regulated by Congress,” the examining attorney must ask the applicant whether there is use in commerce that may lawfully be regulated by Congress and require a satisfactory explanation or showing of such use.  When necessary, the examining attorney may also require additional information or evidence concerning the use of the mark to permit full consideration of the issue.  37 C.F.R. §2.61(b);

<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e657">The only date that will be recognized for USPTO proceedings is the latest definite date specified by the applicant.  However, the applicant may use indefinite terms in describing dates if the applicant considers it necessary due to uncertainty as to the particular date.  Although terms such as “at least as early as,” “prior to,” “before,” “on or about,” and “in” are acceptable for the record, these terms are not printed in the <i>Official Gazette</i> or on the certificate of registration.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-5d90e663">When a month and year are given without a specified day, the date presumed for purposes of examination is the last day of the month.  When only a year is given, the date presumed for purposes of examination is the last day of the year.  Some examples are as follows:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li class="nobull"> “Prior to January 1, 1955” is treated as December 31, 1954.

<li class="nobull"> “On or about June 18, 1987” is treated as June 18, 1987.

<li class="nobull"> “1990” is treated as December 31, 1990.

</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-7d90e707">When an applicant alleges only a year prefaced by vague or ambiguous language such as “in the Spring of,” the USPTO will construe the date as the last day of that year, unless the applicant amends to specify a particular date or a particular month of the specified year.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-8d90e710">When an applicant’s date of first use in commerce is more specific than its date of first use anywhere, the above presumption can result in an unacceptable dates-of-use clause in which the date of first use in commerce precedes the date of first use anywhere.  For example:
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-1d90e715">First use anywhere:  1991</p>
<p id="ch900_d1d4cc_1afcc_38a">First use in commerce:  January 15, 1991 
</p>
<p id="ch900_d1d4cc_1afd1_186">Usual presumption of first use anywhere:  December 31, 1991 (which results in a logical inconsistency).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-10d90e719">Therefore, when the above presumption would be applicable, and the result is a date of first use in commerce that precedes the date of first use anywhere, the examining attorney must contact the applicant by telephone or e-mail, if appropriate, for authorization to amend the date of first use anywhere to the same date as the date of the first use in commerce.  This may be done by examiner’s amendment.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-11d90e722">Indefinite phraseology of the type described above is not considered to be misleading, because it does give notice that, when called upon to do so, the applicant may undertake to prove a date earlier than the one stated.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-12d90e726">The presumed dates discussed above are <i>not</i> entered into the automated records of the USPTO, or printed in the <i>Official Gazette</i> or on the certificate of registration.  Instead, only the information provided by the applicant is printed.  Thus, if the applicant states that the mark was first used “at least as early as January of 1994,” the date printed is “1/0/1994.”  If applicant states that the mark was first used “sometime in 1965,” the date printed is “0/0/1965.”
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-13d90e735">In an inter partes proceeding, a date of use must be established by appropriate evidence.  A date of use set forth in an application or registration owned by applicant or registrant is not evidence on behalf of that applicant or registrant.  37 C.F.R. §2.122(b)(2); <i>Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Manual of Procedure</i> (“TBMP”) §704.04.

<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e1290">An acceptable specimen might be a photograph or printout of a display screen projecting the identifying trademark of a computer program, or a photograph of a frame(s) of a movie or video bearing the mark.  It is not necessary that purchasers see the mark prior to purchasing the goods, as long as the mark is applied to the goods or their containers, or to a display associated with the goods, and the goods are sold or transported in commerce.

<i>See In re Azteca Systems, Inc.</i>, 102 USPQ2d 1955 (TTAB 2012).

<p id="ch900_d1b1b6_27a2a">Specimens for software may also indicate that the software is a “beta” version. This term is commonly used in the software field to identify a preliminary version of a product. Although some beta products may not be made available to consumers, others are. Thus, the appearance of this term on a specimen for software does not, by itself, necessarily mean that the relevant goods are not in actual use in commerce or that the specimen is unacceptable. However, if examination of the specimen indicates that the beta version is not in actual use in commerce, the examining attorney must refuse registration because applicant has not provided evidence of use of the applied-for mark in commerce.

<p id="TMEP-ch-900-3d90e1365">A display must be associated directly with the goods offered for sale.  It must bear the trademark prominently.  However, it is not necessary that the display be in close proximity to the goods.  
<i>See In re Marriott Corp.</i>, 459 F.2d 525, 173 USPQ 799 (C.C.P.A. 1972);
<i> Lands’ End Inc. v. Manbeck</i>, 797 F. Supp. 511, 24 USPQ2d 1314 (E.D. Va. 1992).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e1374">Displays associated with the goods essentially comprise point-of-sale material such as banners, shelf-talkers, window displays, menus, and similar devices.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-5d90e1377">These items must be designed to catch the attention of purchasers and prospective purchasers as an inducement to make a sale.  Further, the display must prominently display the trademark in question and associate it with, or relate it to, the goods.  
<i>In re Osterberg</i>, 83 USPQ2d 1220 (TTAB 2007); <i>In re Morganroth</i>, 208 USPQ 284 (TTAB 1980) (purported mark was so obfuscated on the specimen that it was not likely to make any impression on the reader).  The display must be related to the sale of the goods such that an association of the two is inevitable.  
<i>See In re Bright of America, Inc.,</i> 205 USPQ 63 (TTAB 1979), and cases cited therein.  
<i>See also In re ITT Rayonier Inc.,</i> 208 USPQ 86 (TTAB 1980).

<p id="TMEP-ch-900-6d90e1400">Folders, brochures, or other materials that describe goods and their characteristics or serve as advertising literature are not per se “displays.”  
<i>In re Schiapparelli Searle,</i> 26 USPQ2d 1520 (TTAB 1993);
<i> In re Drilco Industrial Inc.,</i> 15 USPQ2d 1671 (TTAB 1990).  In order to rely on such materials as specimens, an applicant must submit evidence of point-of-sale presentation.  Such evidence must consist of more than an applicant's statement that copies of the material were distributed at sales presentations or tradeshows.  A mere statement that advertising and promotional materials are used in connection with sales presentations is not sufficient, in and of itself, to transform advertising and promotional materials into displays used in association with the goods.  
<i>Osterberg</i>, 83 USPQ2d 1220, 1224 (“Applicant's declaration lacks sufficient detail to transform the web page from advertising into a display used in association with the goods.  For example, there is no discussion regarding how the applicant used the web page at sales presentations to make an association between the mark and the products or whether consumers, in fact, associated the mark with the products.  The use of advertising material in connection with the sales of a product does not ipso facto make it a display used in association with the goods sufficient to support technical trademark use for registration.”); <i>see also In re Anpath Group, Inc.,</i> 95 USPQ2d 1377 (TTAB 2010) (holding that pamphlet and flyer listing the URL of applicant’s website and/or a telephone number for contacting sales representatives does not create the same point-of-sale situation as a detailed catalogue, a detailed web page, or a situation where there is the option of placing an order based upon detailed information from the specimen); <i>In re Ancha Electronics Inc.</i>, 1 USPQ2d 1318 (TTAB 1986); (holding that a photograph showing an informational flyer or leaflet clearly depicting the mark and presented on the goods at a trade show exhibit was an acceptable display associated with the goods); <i>In re Columbia Chase Corp.</i>, 215 USPQ 478 (TTAB 1982) (holding that folders and brochures describing goods and their characteristics or serving as advertising literature are not displays, and the appearance of marks and product photographs in such literature does not per se amount to use of a mark on displays without evidence of point-of-sale presentation).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-7d90e1422">An infomercial was held to be a display associated with the goods, where the goods were shown either immediately before or immediately after the trademark was displayed, and the information on how to order the goods was given within a reasonable time after the goods were shown.  The Board found that the infomercial created an association between the trademark and the goods, and the test for constituting a display associated with the goods was, therefore, satisfied.  
<i>In re Hydron Techs., Inc.</i>, 51 USPQ2d 1531 (TTAB 1999).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-8d90e1428">Displays associated with the goods also exist in an electronic or online environment in the form of web pages. These “electronic displays” perform the same function as traditional displays and must meet the same standards for an acceptable specimen as traditional displays. <i>See In re Sones</i>, 590 F.3d 1282, 1288, 93 USPQ2d 1118, 1123 (Fed.

<p id="TMEP-ch-900-3d90e1446">In appropriate cases, catalogs are acceptable specimens of trademark use.  
<i>See Lands’ End Inc. v. Manbeck</i>, 797 F. Supp. 511, 24 USPQ2d 1314 (E.D. Va. 1992).  In that case, the applicant had applied to register “KETCH” for purses.  The specimen was a catalog page that included a picture of the goods and, below the picture, the mark and a description of the goods.  The Court stated, “The alleged trademark ‘KETCH’ appears prominently in large bold lettering on the display of purses in the Lands’ End specimen in a manner which closely associates the term with the purses.”  24 USPQ2d at 1315.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e1452">The Court determined that the catalog was not mere advertising and that it met the relevant criteria for displays associated with the goods.  The Court evaluated the catalog specimen as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-1d90e1457">A customer can identify a listing and make a decision to purchase by filling out the sales form and sending it in or by calling in a purchase by phone.  A customer can easily associate the product with the word “KETCH” in the display....  The point of sale nature of this display, when combined with the prominent display of the alleged mark with the product, leads this court to conclude that this mark constitutes a display associated with the goods.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-6d90e1462">24 USPQ2d at 1316.</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-7d90e1465">Accordingly, examining attorneys may accept any catalog or similar specimen as a display associated with the goods, provided that it:  (1)  includes a picture or a sufficient textual description of the relevant goods; (2)  shows the mark in association with the goods; <i>and</i> (3)  includes the information necessary to order the goods (e.g., an order form or a phone number, mailing address, or e-mail address for placing orders).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-8d90e1471">However, the inclusion of a phone number, Internet address, and/or mailing address merely as part of corporate contact information on an advertisement describing the product is not in itself sufficient to meet the criteria for a display associated with the goods.  There must be an offer to accept orders or instructions on how to place an order.  
<i>See In re MediaShare Corp.</i>, 43 USPQ2d 1304,1306 (TTAB 1997) (finding applicant’s fact sheet brochure, which included an address and phone number but omitted any information as to product price and how to order applicant's software, was merely advertising material).  It is not necessary that the specimen list the price of the goods.

</p>
<p id="ch900_d1fd00_19260_1d9">The mark must also be displayed on the web page in a manner in which customers will recognize it as a mark. <i>See In re Morganroth</i>, 208 USPQ 284, 287-88 (TTAB 1980); <i>see also In re Osterberg</i>, 83 USPQ2d 1220, 1223 (TTAB 2007) (finding that CONDOMTOY CONDOM was not displayed so prominently on web page specimen that consumers would recognize it as a trademark for condoms). See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e1927">TMEP § 1202.04</a>
 regarding matter that is merely informational in nature.
</p>
<p id="ch900_d1fd00_18ddf_f3">Generally, a web page will display the trademark in association with a picture of the goods. However, in <i>Sones</i>, the Federal Circuit held that although a visual depiction of the goods “is an important consideration in determining whether a submitted specimen sufficiently associates a mark with the source of the goods,” a picture of the goods on the web page is not mandatory. <i>In re Sones</i>. at 1288, 93 USPQ2d at 1123.  A textual description may suffice where “the actual features or inherent characteristics of the goods are recognizable from the textual description, given that the more standard the product is, the less comprehensive the textual description need be.”  
<i>Id.</i> at 1289, 93 USPQ2d at 1124.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e1504">An applicant need not describe a web-page specimen as a “display” for it to qualify as an acceptable display specimen, nor must the web page come from an applicant’s own website. A web page from a third-party website may be acceptable as a display if the mark is sufficiently associated with the applicant’s goods. <i>See In re Osterberg</i>, 83 USPQ2d at1221, 1223-24 (finding the specimen unacceptable not because it was a web page from a third-party website, but because it neither showed the mark in association with the goods nor provided a means for ordering the goods). For instance, a manufacturer of bed linens may rely on a third-party retail vendor’s web page when the web page shows a picture of the bed linens in association with the mark and provides a means for ordering them, as shown in Example 1.

</li>
<li class="nobull"> There is a “shopping bag” at the top of the web page to enable direct ordering.
</li>
<li class="nobull"> Even if the web page did not include the larger LACOSTE mark, the LACOSTE marks depicted under the photographs of the goods (e.g., Lacoste “Brighton” Comforter Set or Lacoste “Confetti” Comforter Set) would be acceptable to show trademark use for the goods.
</li>
<li class="nobull"> If the proposed mark were “Macy’s” (as it appears in the upper-left corner), the web page would not be acceptable for goods because of the closer proximity and association of the other marks with the goods (i.e., the LACOSTE and alligator).
</li>
</ul>
<p id="ch900_d1fd02_1b358_30c">Similarly, a web page from a third–party, social-media website may also be accepted provided the web page satisfies the elements of a display specimen.
</p>
<p id="ch900_d1fd02_1b3a4_cf">However, while a web page display associated with the goods is an acceptable specimen for goods, mere advertising material is not. <i>In re Anpath Grp</i>., 95 USPQ2d 1377, 1380 (TTAB 2010); <i>In re Quantum Foods, Inc</i>., 94 USPQ2d 1375, 1379 (TTAB 2010); <i>In re Osterberg</i>, 83 USPQ2d at 1224; <i>In re Dell Inc</i>., 71 USPQ2d at 1727; <i>In re MediaShare Corp</i>., 43 USPQ2d 1304, 1307 (TTAB 1997). Acceptable web-page displays are not merely advertising, but instead serve as point-of-sale displays, because the website on which the web page appears is, in effect, an electronic retail store, and the web page is a shelf-talker or banner which encourages the consumer to buy the product and provides the information necessary to do so. A consumer using the link on the web page to purchase the goods is the equivalent of a consumer seeing a shelf-talker and taking the item to the cashier in a store to purchase it. <i>See In re Dell Inc</i>., 71 USPQ2d at 1727. The web page is, thus, a point-of-sale display by which an actual sale is made.
</p>
<p id="ch900_d1fd02_1b4c7_2b8">A point-of-sale display is “‘calculated to consummate a sale’”; that is, it includes the information necessary for the consumer to decide to purchase the goods, and it appears in a setting that allows the consumer to immediately buy the goods. <i>In re Quantum Foods, Inc</i>., 94 USPQ2d at 1379 (quoting <i>In re Bright of Am., Inc</i>., 205 USPQ 63, 71 (TTAB 1979)); <i>In re Anpath Grp</i>., 95 USPQ2d at 1382; <i>In re MediaShare Corp</i>., 43 USPQ2d at 1305; <i>Lands’ End Inc</i>., 797 F. Supp. at 514, 24 USPQ2d at 1316. An advertisement, however, merely describes or touts the benefits of the goods, influences people to buy them, or informs the public about the goods and the company that provides them. <i>In re Anpath Grp</i>., 95 USPQ2d at 1381-82; <i>In re Quantum Foods, Inc</i>., 94 USPQ2d at 1379. It does not offer a way to directly purchase the goods, because it either does not contain an offer to accept orders for the goods or does not provide special instructions for placing orders for the goods. <i>In re Quantum Foods, Inc</i>., 94 USPQ2d at 1380; <i>In re Osterberg</i>, 83 USPQ2d at 1224.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-5d90e1510">Therefore, a web page that merely provides information about the goods, but does not provide a means of ordering them, is viewed as promotional material, which is not acceptable to show trademark use on goods.  
<i>See In re Genitope Corp.,</i>78 USPQ2d 1819, 1822 (TTAB 2006) (“[T]he company name, address and phone number that appears at the end of the web page indicates only location information about applicant; it does not constitute a means to order goods through the mail or by telephone, in the way that a catalog sales form provides a means for one to fill out a sales form or call in a purchase by phone.”).  Merely providing a link to the websites of online distributors is not sufficient.  There must be a means of ordering the goods directly from the applicant’s web page, such as a telephone number for placing orders or an online ordering process.  
<i>In re Quantum Foods, Inc.,</i> 94 USPQ2d at 1380; <i>In re Osterberg</i>, 83 USPQ2d at 1224.
</p>
<p id="ch900_d1fd02_1b8a9_271">When a web-page specimen appears to be merely advertising, statements by the applicant that the specimen is used in connection with the sale of the goods, without evidence or a detailed explanation of the manner of use, will not suffice to establish that the specimen is a display associated with the goods. <i>In re Osterberg</i>, 83 USPQ2d at 1224 (finding that applicant’s mere statement in a signed declaration that copies of the web page were distributed at sales presentation lacked sufficient detail to transform the web page from an advertisement into a display associated with the goods).
</p>
<p id="ch900_d1fd02_1ba4d_3d2">Whether a web-page display qualifies as an acceptable specimen is a question of fact, based on the evidence of record. <i>In re Azteca Sys., Inc</i>., 102 USPQ2d at 1957 (citing <i>Lands’ End</i>, 797 F. Supp. at 514, 24 USPQ2d at 1316); <i>In re Hydron Techs. Inc</i>., 51 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (TTAB 1999). The presentation on the web page of the picture or description of the goods, the manner of the mark’s use in association with those goods, and the nature of the ordering information affect the specimen’s acceptability. Thus, a specimen that describes or displays a picture of the goods, shows the mark, and provides ordering information may nonetheless be unacceptable because it fails to demonstrate an association between the mark and the goods. Sometimes, a single fact or piece of evidence may be dispositive. Often, however, a combination of facts and evidence of record may be required to establish the acceptability of the specimen. If ordering information is not readily discernible from the submitted web page, the applicant may provide multiple, sequential web pages as part of the specimen to clarify the ordering process on the website.

<p id="ch900_d1fd02_1c0e5_111">In order for a display to be associated with the goods, something on the web page must show or describe the goods for the consumer, that is, a picture or description of the goods. <i>See In re Sones</i>, 590 F.3d 1282, 1288-89, 93 USPQ2d 1118, 1123-24 (Fed. Cir. 2009). A description will suffice if “the actual features or inherent characteristics of the goods are recognizable from the textual description.” <i>Id</i>. <i>at</i> 1289, 93 USPQ2d at 1124. The level of detail required depends on the type of goods at issue. <i>Id</i>. Standard products (e.g., television sets, baseball gloves, or pet food) typically will not require a comprehensive description for the consumer to know what the goods are. Complicated or sophisticated products (e.g., computer products, medical devices, or industrial machinery) may require a more detailed description, in the absence of a picture of the goods.

<p id="ch900_d1fd02_1d5ae_1b6">A web-page display specimen “must in some way evince that the mark is ‘associated’ with the goods and serves as an indicator of source.” <i>In re Sones</i>, 590 F.3d 1282, 1288, 93 USPQ2d 1118, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Assessing the “mark-goods” association on a web page involves many variables, including the prominence and placement of the mark, the content and layout of the web page, and the overall impression the web page creates. Web-page content and layout may sometimes distract consumers and prevent them from making the necessary connection between the mark and the identified goods. <i>In re Azteca Sys., Inc</i>., 102 USPQ2d 1955, 1958 (TTAB 2012). Factors such as the proximity of the mark to the goods, the presence of other marks, intervening text between the mark and the goods, and the inclusion of other material that is unrelated or marginally related to the identified goods, tend to disrupt purchasers from making the mark-goods association, as shown in Example 2. <i>Id</i>.

<p id="ch900_d1fd02_21179_223">These factors are not dispositive, and the web page as a whole must be assessed to determine whether the applied-for mark functions as a trademark for the identified goods.

<i>Appearance in Website and E-mail Addresses</i>
. When a mark appears in the computer browser area as part of the URL, Internet address, or domain name of the website that houses the web page, consumers generally do not recognize this as trademark use. Instead, this use merely identifies the Internet location of the website where business is conducted and goods or services are offered. <i>See, e.g</i>., <i>In re Roberts</i>, 87 USPQ2d 1474, 1479-80 (TTAB 2008) (concluding that the mark IRESTMYCASE, which appeared as part of a website address, www.irestmycase.com, on applicant’s specimens, merely served as a contact address to reach the applicant and failed to function as a service mark for applicant’s services); <i>In re Supply Guys, Inc</i>., 86 USPQ2d 1488, 1493 (TTAB 2008) ( “[A]pplicant’s use of the term LEADING EDGE TONERS as part of the internet address, www.leadingedgetoners.com, . . . identifies the website where applicant conducts its retail sales services. Obviously, a website can be used for multiple purposes and the simple fact that a term is used as part of the internet address does not mean that it is a trademark for the goods sold on the website.”); <i>In re Eilberg</i>, 49 USPQ2d 1955, 1956 (TTAB 1998) (finding that the mark WWW.EILBERG.COM, when displayed in relatively small and subdued typeface below other contact information on applicant’s letterhead, merely indicated the Internet location of applicant’s website rather than functioning as a service mark for applicant’s legal services). Similarly, the use of the mark embedded in an e-mail address would be viewed as part of the website address where applicant may be contacted, rather than as a trademark.

<i>Placement in a Location Typical for a Retail-Store Service Mark</i>
. A mark may be displayed at the top of a web page, separated from the relevant goods by the website navigation tabs, which may direct consumers to information about the goods, the applicant, and the website. Since it is customary for retailers to place their store marks in this location, such use of the applied-for mark is likely be recognized as an online retail-store service mark, as shown in Example 3.

<i>Displayed in or Near Corporate Contact Information</i>

However, they may suffice if accompanied by special instructions for placing or accepting orders, such as “call now to buy” or “e-mail your order.” If no ordering instructions appear, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses may be sufficient if: (1) the web page contains enough product and ordering information to enable the consumer to buy the goods (e.g., the web page shows the goods; offers size, color, or quantity selections; price; identifies credit card payment options; or states shipping methods); (2) the record contains an explanation or evidence that clearly supports the conclusion that the telephone number or e-mail address can be used for ordering, rather than merely for obtaining information about the goods or the ordering process; or (3) the telephone number or e-mail address is prominently placed close to the goods, indicating it as a means of ordering (see Example 8). <i>See In re Valenite Inc</i>., 84 USPQ2d 1346, 1349 (TTAB 2007); <i>In re Osterberg</i>, 83 USPQ2d at 1224 (indicating that applicant’s web-page specimen might have met the ordering information requirement for a point-of-purchase display if the web page had contained a telephone number or online process for ordering the goods, or if the record otherwise showed that “a purchase [could] be made directly from the webpage or from information provided in the webpage”).

In such a special situation, the telephone number would suffice if product information is available on the web page or website and the evidentiary record adequately explains the specialized nature of the goods, the industry practice for ordering them, and the need to consult with sales staff over the telephone to place customized orders. In the case <i>In re Valenite Inc.,</i> the Board found a web page containing a link to an online catalog, along with a toll-free number and links to customer service and technical support, to be an acceptable specimen, where the goods (industrial tools) were specialized industrial goods, and the record contained declaration evidence that purchase of the goods requires careful calculation and technical knowledge, and that the phone numbers were in fact used to order the goods.   84 USPQ2d at 1349-50 (“[A]pplicant’s website, in addition to showing pictures of the goods, provides an on-line catalog, technical information apparently intended to further the prospective purchaser’s determination of which particular product to consider, an online calculator and both a link to, and phone number for, customer service representatives.  Therefore, applicant’s website provides the prospective purchaser with sufficient information that the customer can select a product and call customer service to confirm the correctness of the selection and place an order.”). <i>Cf.</i>
<i>In re U.S. Tsubaki, Inc</i>., 109 USPQ2d 2002, 2007 (TTAB 2014) (stating that “where it is asserted that the nature of the goods and the consumers . . . require more involved means for ordering products, it is critical that the examining attorney be provided with detailed information about the means for ordering goods, and that such information be corroborated by sufficient evidentiary support.”). The <i>Valenite</i> decision should not be interpreted as a broad-reaching change in USPTO practice regarding the determination of whether a website page constitutes a display associated with the goods.  If it appears that the web page merely provides information about the goods, but does not provide a means of ordering the goods directly from the applicant’s web page, it should be viewed as promotional material and a refusal should be issued. <i>Id</i>. at 2009 (finding that specimens did not contain adequate information for making a decision to purchase the goods and placing an order and, therefore, were advertisements).

<li class="nobull"> Simply providing a “contact us” link does not convert advertising into a display and, in fact, the “contact us” link here does not even enable ordering, but only leads to applicant’s contact information. While the “Contact Us” web page was rejected as untimely, the TTAB stated that, although it may ultimately result in a sale, the “Contact Us” web page “appears to be no more calculated to do so than any corporate contact e-mail address or phone number that would result in the call or e-mail being referred to the sales office.” <i>In re Quantum Foods, Inc</i>., 94 USPQ2d 1375, 1377 n.2 (TTAB 2010).

<p id="ch900_d1fd06_25195_1e1">Similarly, “Customize” and “Configure” buttons and links that allow customers to configure the goods generally are insufficient by themselves, since such features only enable personalization and not necessarily purchase of the goods.

However, if examination of the specimen indicates that the beta version is not in actual use in commerce, the examining attorney must refuse registration because applicant has not provided evidence of use of the applied-for mark in commerce.

<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e1577">A mere assertion of impracticability does not suffice to establish that traditional trademark use is impracticable.  Rather, the record must indicate that the goods are, in fact, of such a nature.  In 
<i>In re Settec, Inc.,</i> 80 USPQ2d 1185 (TTAB 2006), the applicant asserted that placing the mark on the goods or on displays associated with the goods in the traditional manner was impracticable because the purpose of the goods was to provide digital media copy protection to media content providers, and placing the mark on the final product available to the ultimate end-user would impair the value of the goods, because the end-user would thereby be armed with an additional piece of the encryption puzzle.  The Board rejected this contention, finding that there were a variety of ways in which applicant could use its mark in the traditional manner without making it available to the end-user.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e1854">The following non-exhaustive list reflects examples of "use-in-commerce" problems that may be raised on initial review of specimens:

<li class="nobull"> The applied-for mark does not appear on the specimen;

<li class="nobull"> The specimen is altered/mutilated/unprintable or illegible;

</li>
</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-6d90e1919">In an Office action addressing such specimen issues, the examining attorney must indicate that registration is refused because applicant has not provided evidence of use of the applied-for mark in commerce. The statutory basis for refusal is 15 U.S.C. §§1051 and 1127. The examining attorney must also require the applicant to submit a substitute specimen and, if necessary, a supporting affidavit or declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20.  If the refusal is made because the specimen is altered, mutilated, or illegible, the applicant may respond by submitting a true, unaltered copy of the originally submitted specimen that is clear and readable, with a statement by the person who transmitted it that it is a true copy of the specimen that was originally submitted.

For example, if the original specimen was a photocopy of the drawing, and the applicant submits, in a response to the refusal, a substitute specimen that comprises advertising for its goods, this does not present a new issue. However, if the applicant responds to the refusal by submitting a substitute specimen that fails to show the applied-for mark functioning as a trademark or service mark (e.g., shows the mark is merely ornamental), this presents a new issue that requires issuance of a new nonfinal Office action.

<p id="TMEP-ch-900-3d90e2397">If a specimen in an application shows the federal registration symbol used with the mark that is the subject of the application, or with any portion of this mark, the examining attorney must determine from USPTO records whether or not such matter is registered.  If it is not, and if the symbol does not appear to indicate registration in a foreign country (

), the examining attorney must point out to the applicant that the records of the USPTO do not show that the mark with which the symbol is used on the specimens is registered, and that the registration symbol may not be used until a mark is registered in the USPTO.  The examining attorney should not require any explanation or comment from the applicant concerning the use of the symbol in relation to the mark.

<p id="TMEP-ch-900-3d90e2439">When the sale or transportation of any product for which registration of a trademark is sought is regulated under an Act of Congress, the Patent and Trademark Office may make appropriate inquiry as to compliance with such Act for the sole purpose of determining lawfulness of the commerce recited in the application.
</p>
</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-4d90e2442">Use of a mark in commerce must be lawful use to be the basis for federal registration of the mark.  Under 37 C.F.R. §2.69, the USPTO may inquire about compliance with federal laws to confirm that the applicant’s use of the mark in commerce is lawful. Generally, the USPTO presumes that an applicant’s use of the mark in commerce is lawful and does not inquire whether such use is lawful unless the record or other evidence shows a clear violation of law, such as the sale or transportation of a controlled substance.  See 21 U.S.C. §§801-971 (The Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) makes it unlawful to: manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess a controlled substance; and sell, offer for sale, or use any facility of interstate commerce to transport drug paraphernalia). Regardless of state law, the federal law provides no exception to the above-referenced provisions for marijuana for “medical use.” See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 27, 29 (2005); see also United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coop., 532 U.S. 483, 491 (2001); U.S. Const. Art. VI. Cl. 2. The examining attorney must inquire about compliance with federal laws or refuse registration based on the absence of lawful use in commerce when a court or the responsible federal agency has issued a finding of noncompliance under the relevant statute or where there has been a per se violation of the relevant statute.  
<i>Kellogg Co. v. New Generation Foods Inc.</i>, 6 USPQ2d 2045 (TTAB 1988);
<i> Medtronic, Inc. v. Pacesetter Systems, Inc.</i>, 222 USPQ 80 (TTAB 1984).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-900-6d90e2455">For the purpose of determining whether to issue an inquiry, the USPTO will not regard apparent technical violations, such as labeling irregularities on specimens, as violations.  For example, if a package fails to show all required labeling information, the examining attorney should not take any action.  Likewise, the USPTO does not routinely solicit information regarding label approval under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act or similar acts.
