<i>15 U.S.C. §1052   Extract</i>
</h4>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e7930">No trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it . . . (d) Consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office, or a mark or trade name previously used in the United States by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive. . . .
</p>
</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e7933">Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1052(d), is the statutory basis for a refusal to register due to likelihood of confusion with another mark. Section 2(d) applies regardless of whether registration of the mark is sought on the Principal Register or the Supplemental Register.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e7944">In the ex parte examination of a trademark application, a refusal under §2(d) is normally based on the examining attorney’s conclusion that the applicant’s mark, as used on or in connection with the specified goods or services, so resembles a
<i> registered</i> mark as to be likely to cause confusion. See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e6456">TMEP §1207.02</a>
 concerning application of the §2(d) provision relating to marks that so resemble another mark as to be likely to deceive, and 

<a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e6462">TMEP §1207.03</a>
 concerning §2(d) refusals based on unregistered marks (which generally are not issued in ex parte examination). 
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b20c_2c01d">The issue is not whether the respective marks themselves, or the goods or services offered under the marks, are likely to be confused but, rather, whether there is a likelihood of confusion as to the source or sponsorship of the goods or services because of the marks used thereon. <i>See, e.g., Paula Payne Prods. Co. v. Johnson’s Publ’g Co.</i>, 473 F.2d 901, 902, 177 USPQ 76, 77 (C.C.P.A. 1973) (“[T]he question is not whether people will confuse the marks, but rather whether the marks will confuse people into believing that the goods they identify emanate from the same source.”); <i>In re Majestic Distilling Co.,</i> 315 F.3d 1311, 1316, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1205 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (“[T]he...mistaken belief that [a good] is manufactured or sponsored by the same entity [as another good] ... is precisely the mistake that §2(d) of the Lanham Act seeks to prevent.”); <i>In re Shell Oil Co.</i>, 992 F.2d 1204, 1207, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (“The degree of ‘relatedness’ must be viewed in the context of all the factors, in determining whether the services are sufficiently related that a reasonable consumer would be confused as to source or sponsorship.”); <i>In re Binion</i>, 93 USPQ2d 1531, 1534, 1535 (TTAB 2009); <i>In re Ass’n of the U.S. Army</i>, 85 USPQ2d 1264, 1267-68, 1270 (TTAB 2007); <i>Hilson Research Inc. v. Soc’y for Human Res. Mgmt.</i>, 27 USPQ2d 1423, 1429 (TTAB 1993) (“Although confusion, mistake or deception about source or origin is the usual issue posed under Section 2(d), any confusion made likely by a junior user’s mark is cause for refusal; likelihood of confusion encompasses confusion of sponsorship, affiliation or connection.”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e7962">The examining attorney must conduct a search of USPTO records to determine whether the applicant’s mark so resembles any registered mark(s) as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake, when used on or in connection with the goods or services identified in the application. The examining attorney also searches pending applications for conflicting marks with earlier effective filing dates. See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e6711">TMEP §§1208-1208.03(c)</a>
 regarding conflicting marks. The examining attorney must place a copy of the search strategy in the record.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e7973">If the examining attorney determines that there is a likelihood of confusion between applicant’s mark and a previously registered mark or marks, the examining attorney refuses registration of the applicant’s mark under §2(d). Before citing a registration, the examining attorney must check the automated records of the USPTO to confirm that any registration that is the basis for a §2(d) refusal is an active registration. See <a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e2598">TMEP §716.02(e)</a>
 regarding suspension pending cancellation of a cited registration under §8 of the Act or expiration of a cited registration for failure to renew under §9 of the Act. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e7980">Also, if USPTO records indicate that an assignment of the conflicting registration has been recorded, the examining attorney must check the automated records of the Assignment Recordation Branch of the USPTO to determine whether the conflicting mark has been assigned to applicant.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-7d105e7983">In the seminal case involving §2(d),
<i>In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.</i>, the U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals discussed the factors relevant to a determination of likelihood of confusion. 476 F.2d 1357, 177 USPQ 563 (C.C.P.A. 1973). In setting forth the factors, the court cautioned that, with respect to determining likelihood of confusion, “[t]here is no litmus rule which can provide a ready guide to all cases.” <i>Id</i>. at 1361, 177 USPQ at 567. Not all of the factors are relevant and only those relevant factors for which there is evidence in the record must be considered. <i>Id</i>. at 1361-62, 177 USPQ at 567-68; <i>see also In re Mighty Leaf Tea</i>, 601 F.3d 1342, 1346, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (“Not all of the <i>DuPont</i> factors are relevant to every case, and only factors of significance to the particular mark need be considered.”); <i>In re Majestic Distilling Co.</i>, 315 F.3d 1311, 1315, 65 USPQ2d 1201, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing <i>In re Dixie Rests., Inc.</i>, 105 F.3d 1405, 1406-07, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533 (Fed. Cir. 1997)); <i>Cunningham v. Laser Golf Corp.</i>, 222 F.3d 943, 946, 55 USPQ2d 1842, 1845 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Furthermore, the significance of a particular factor may differ from case to case. <i>See du Pont,</i> 476 F.2d at 1361-62, 177 USPQ at 567-68; <i>Dixie Rests.</i>, 105 F.3d at 1406-07, 41 USPQ2d at 1533 (noting that “any one of the factors may control a particular case”).
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b20c_2c628">Although the weight given to the relevant <i>du Pont</i> factors may vary, the following two factors are key considerations in any likelihood of confusion determination:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull"> The similarity or dissimilarity of the marks in their entireties as to appearance, sound, connotation and commercial impression.
</li>
<li class="nobull"> The relatedness of the goods or services as described in the application and registration(s).

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="ch1200_d1b20c_2c854">The following factors may also be relevant in an ex parte likelihood-of-confusion determination and must be considered if there is pertinent evidence in the record:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull"> The similarity or dissimilarity of established, likely-to-continue trade channels.
</li>
<li class="nobull"> The conditions under which and buyers to whom sales are made, i.e., “impulse” vs. careful, sophisticated purchasing (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e6217">TMEP §1207.01(d)(vii)</a>).

 regarding the “fame of the prior mark” factor.
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b20c_2ccfe">As should be clear from the foregoing, there is no mechanical test for determining likelihood of confusion and “each case must be decided on its own facts.” <i>Du Pont</i>, 476 F.2d at 1361, 177 USPQ at 567. In some cases, a determination that there is no likelihood of confusion may be appropriate, even where the marks are similar and the goods/services are related, because these factors are outweighed by other factors, such as differences in the relevant trade channels of the goods/services, the presence in the marketplace of a significant number of similar marks in use on similar goods/services, the existence of a valid consent agreement between the parties, or another established fact probative of the effect of use. For example, in <i>In re Strategic Partners, Inc.</i>, 102 USPQ2d 1397 (TTAB 2012), the Board reversed a refusal to register the mark ANYWEAR (in stylized text), for “footwear,” finding no likelihood of confusion with the registered mark ANYWEAR BY JOSIE NATORI (and design), for “jackets, shirts, pants, stretch T-tops and stoles.” Given the similarity in the marks and the relatedness of the goods, the Board stated that “under usual circumstances” it would conclude that confusion is likely to occur; however, an “unusual situation” compelled the Board “to balance the similarities between the marks and goods against the facts that applicant already owns a registration for a substantially similar mark for the identical goods, and that applicant’s registration and the cited registration have coexisted for over five years.” <i>Id</i>. at 1399. Applicant’s prior registration of ANYWEARS for goods including footwear was substantially similar to the applied-for mark ANYWEAR for the same goods, and the registration had achieved incontestable status. <i>Id.</i> Basing its decision on the thirteenth <i>du Pont</i> factor, which “relates to ‘any other established fact probative of the effect of use,’” the Board determined that this factor outweighed the others and confusion was unlikely. <i>Id</i>. at 1399-1400 (quoting <i>du Pont</i>, 476 F.2d at 1361, 177 USPQ at 567).
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1d84f_20874_2d2">The decision in <i>Strategic Partners</i> may be applied and weighed against a §2(d) refusal in the limited situation where: (1) an applicant owns a prior registration for the same mark or a mark with no meaningful difference from the applied-for-mark; (2) the identifications of goods/services in the application and applicant’s prior registration are identical or identical in relevant part; and (3) the applicant’s prior registration has co-existed for at least five years with the registration being considered as the basis for the Section 2(d) refusal. See <i>Id</i>. at 1400. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-13d105e8065">The determination of likelihood of confusion under §2(d) in an intent-to-use application under §1(b) of the Trademark Act does not differ from the determination in any other type of application.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e5130">1207.01(a)  Relatedness of the Goods or Services</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e8076">In assessing the relatedness of the goods and/or services, the more similar the marks at issue, the less similar the goods or services need to be to support a finding of likelihood of confusion. <i>In re Shell Oil Co.</i>, 992 F.2d 1204, 1207, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <i>Gen. Mills, Inc. v. Fage Dairy Processing Indus.

If the marks of the respective parties are identical or virtually identical, the relationship between the goods and/or services need not be as close to support a finding of likelihood of confusion as would be required if there were differences between the marks. <i>Shell Oil</i>, 992 F.2d at 1207, 26 USPQ2d at 1689; <i>In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd.</i>, 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202 (TTAB 2009); <i>In re Thor Tech, Inc.</i>, 90 USPQ2d 1634, 1636 (TTAB 2009).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e8082">In some instances, because of established marketing practices, the use of identical marks on seemingly unrelated goods and services could result in a likelihood of confusion. <i>See</i>
<i>In re Sloppy Joe’s Int’l, Inc.</i>, 43 USPQ2d 1350, 1356 (TTAB 1997) (“[T]he licensing of the names and/or likenesses of well known persons for use on various goods and services is a common practice.”); <i>In re Phillips-Van Heusen Corp.</i>, 228 USPQ 949, 951 (TTAB 1986) (“The licensing of commercial trademarks for use on ‘collateral’ products (such as clothing, glassware, linens, etc.), that are unrelated in nature to those goods or services on which the marks are normally used, has become a common practice in recent years.”).
</p>
<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e5146">1207.01(a)(i)  Goods or Services Need Not Be Identical</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e8098">In a §2(d) determination, the goods and/or services do not have to be identical or even competitive in order to find that there is a likelihood of confusion. <i>In re Iolo Techs.</i>, LLC, 95 USPQ2d 1498, 1499 (TTAB 2010); <i>In re G.B.I. Tile &amp; Stone, Inc.</i>, 92 USPQ2d 1366, 1368 (TTAB 2009). The issue is not whether the goods and/or services will be confused with each other, but rather whether the public will be confused as to their source. <i>See Recot Inc. v. M.C. Becton</i>, 214 F.3d 1322, 1329, 54 USPQ2d 1894, 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2000) “[E]ven if the goods in question are different from, and thus not related to, one another in kind, the same goods can be related in the mind of the consuming public as to the origin of the goods. It is this sense of relatedness that matters in the likelihood of confusion analysis.”); <i>In re Shell Oil Co.</i>, 992 F.2d 1204, 1207, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 1993);
<i>Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Dresser Indus., Inc</i>., 518 F.2d 1399, 1403–04, 186 USPQ 476, 480 (C.C.P.A. 1975); <i>In re Ass’n of the U.S. Army</i>, 85 USPQ2d 1264, 1270 (TTAB 2007). It is sufficient that the goods and/or services of the applicant and the registrant are related in some manner or that the conditions surrounding their marketing are such that they are likely to be encountered by the same persons under circumstances that, because of the marks used in connection therewith, would lead to the mistaken belief that they originate from the same source. <i>See, e.g., On-line Careline Inc. v. America Online Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 1080, 56 USPQ2d 1471 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding ON-LINE TODAY for Internet connection services and ONLINE TODAY for an electronic publication likely to cause confusion); <i>In re Martin’s Famous Pastry Shoppe, Inc.</i>, 748 F.2d 1565, 223 USPQ 1289 (Fed.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e8123">Conversely, if the goods or services in question are not related or marketed in such a way that they would be encountered by the same persons in situations that would create the incorrect assumption that they originate from the same source, then, even if the marks are identical, confusion is not likely. <i>See, e.g.,</i>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e8193">In <i>Coors</i>, the examining attorney introduced evidence from several sources discussing the practice of some restaurants to offer private label or house brands of beer; evidence that brewpubs who brew their own beer often feature restaurant services; and copies of several third-party registrations showing that a single mark had been registered for both beer and restaurants services. 343 F.3d at 1345, 68 USPQ2d at 1063. However, applicant countered with evidence that while there are about 1,450 brewpubs and microbreweries in the United States, there are over 800,000 restaurants, which means that brewpubs and microbreweries account for only about 18 one-hundredths of one percent of all restaurants. <i>Id</i>. at 1346, 68 USPQ2d at 1063.

<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-1d105e8198">While there was evidence that some restaurants sell private label beer, that evidence did not suggest that such restaurants are numerous. And although the Board had before it a few registrations for both restaurant services and beer, the very small number of such dual use registrations does nothing to counter Coors’ showing that only a very small percentage of restaurants actually brew their own beer or sell house brands of beer; instead, the small number of such registrations suggests that it is quite uncommon for restaurants and beer to share the same trademark. Thus, the evidence before the Board indicates not that there is a substantial overlap between restaurant services and beer with respect to source, but rather that the degree of overlap between the sources of restaurant services and the sources of beer is <i>de minimis</i>. We therefore disagree with the Board’s legal conclusion that Coors’ beer and the registrant’s restaurant services are sufficiently related to support a finding of a likelihood of confusion.

</p>
<p id="ch1200_d22428_29f89_13d">Similarly, there may be a likelihood of confusion where an applicant identifies its goods or services so broadly that the identification encompasses the goods or services identified in the registration of a similar mark. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>In re Fiesta Palms LLC</i>, 85 USPQ2d 1360 (TTAB 2007) (holding CLUB PALMS MVP for casino services, and MVP for casino services offered to preferred customers identified by special identification cards, likely to cause confusion);

In addition, language seeking to limit otherwise identical, or highly similar, goods or services may not be sufficient to distinguish them so as to avoid a likelihood of confusion. <i>See Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Tex. Sys. v. S. Ill. Miners, LLC</i>, 110 USPQ2d 1182, 1190-93 (TTAB 2014) (finding that although opposer’s clothing items were limited by the wording “college imprinted” and the applicant’s identical or highly similar items were limited by the wording “professional baseball imprinted,” these restrictions did not distinguish the goods, their trade channels, or their relevant consumers in any meaningful way).

On the other hand, in articulating reasons for reaching a conclusion on the issue of confusion, there is nothing improper in stating that, for rational reasons, more or less weight has been given to a particular feature of a mark, provided the ultimate conclusion rests on consideration of the marks in their entireties.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e8507">Determining whether there is a likelihood of confusion requires careful consideration of the nature of the common elements of the marks at issue, as well as the overall commercial impression created by each mark.
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b20f_2d4cf">Likelihood of confusion is not necessarily avoided between otherwise confusingly similar marks merely by adding or deleting a house mark, other distinctive matter, or a term that is descriptive or suggestive of the named goods or services; if the dominant portion of both marks is the same, then the marks may be confusingly similar notwithstanding peripheral differences. <i>See. e.g., Stone Lion Capital Partners, L.P. v. Lion Capital LLP</i>, ___ F.3d ____, 110 USPQ2d 1157, 1161 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 26, 2014) (affirming TTAB’s finding that applicant’s mark STONE LION CAPITAL incorporated the entirety of the registered marks LION CAPITAL and LION, and that the noun LION was the dominant part of both parties’ marks); <i>In re Mighty Leaf Tea, </i>601 F.3d 1342, 1347-48, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260-61 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (affirming TTAB’s finding that applicant’s mark, ML, is likely to be perceived as a shortened version of registrant's mark, ML MARK LEES (stylized), when used on the same or closely related skin-care products); <i>Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee En 1772</i>, 396 F.3d 1369, 1372-73, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1692 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (affirming TTAB’s holding that contemporaneous use of appellant’s mark, VEUVE ROYALE, for sparkling wine, and appellee’s marks, VEUVE CLICQUOT and VEUVE CLICQUOT PONSARDIN, for champagne, is likely to cause confusion, noting that the presence of the “strong distinctive term [VEUVE] as the first word in both parties’ marks renders the marks similar, especially in light of the largely laudatory (and hence non-source identifying) significance of the word ROYALE”); <i>In re Chatam Int’l Inc.</i>, <i>380 F.3d 1340</i>, 1343, 71 USPQ2d 1944, 1946 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (“Viewed in their entireties with non-dominant features appropriately discounted, the marks [GASPAR’S ALE for beer and ale and JOSE GASPAR GOLD for tequila] become nearly identical.”); <i>Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Packard Press, Inc</i>., 281 F.3d 1261, 1266, 62 USPQ2d 1001, 1004 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (finding that, even though applicant’s mark PACKARD TECHNOLOGIES (with “TECHNOLOGIES” disclaimed) does not incorporate every feature of opposer’s HEWLETT PACKARD marks, a similar overall commercial impression is created); <i>In re Max Capital Grp. Ltd.,</i> 93 USPQ2d 1243, 1248 (TTAB 2010) (holding applicant's mark, MAX with pillar design, and registrant’s mark, MAX, likely to cause confusion, noting that the “addition of a column design to the cited mark . . . is not sufficient to convey that [the] marks . . . identify different sources for legally identical insurance services”); <i>In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp.,</i> 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1271 (TTAB 2009) (holding VANTAGE TITAN for MRI diagnostic apparatus, and TITAN for medical ultrasound device, likely to cause confusion, noting that the marks are more similar than they are different and that the addition of applicant’s “product mark,” VANTAGE, to the registered mark would not avoid confusion); <i>In re SL&amp;E Training Stable, Inc.</i>, 88 USPQ2d 1216, 1219 (TTAB 2008) (holding SAM EDELMAN and EDELMAN, both for wallets and various types of bags, likely to cause confusion, noting that there are strong similarities between the marks because they share the same surname, and that consumers viewing the mark EDELMAN may perceive it as an abbreviated form of SAM EDELMAN because it is the practice in the fashion industry to refer to surnames alone); <i>In re Chica</i>, <i>Inc.</i>, 84 USPQ2d 1845, 1848-49 (TTAB 2007) (holding CORAZON BY CHICA with design, and CORAZON with design, both for jewelry, likely to cause confusion, noting that, “to many consumers, applicant’s mark for the identical word ‘Corazon’ followed by the phrase ‘BY CHICA’ will simply be viewed as the identification of the previously anonymous source of the goods sold under the mark CORAZON”); <i>In re El Torito Rests. Inc.</i>, 9 USPQ2d 2002 (TTAB 1988) (holding MACHO COMBOS (with “COMBOS” disclaimed), and MACHO (stylized), both for food items as a part of restaurant services, likely to cause confusion);
<i> In re Computer Sys. Ctr. Inc.</i>, 5 USPQ2d 1378, 1381 (TTAB 1987) (holding CSC ADVANCED BUSINESS SYSTEMS for retail computer store services and computer maintenance and repair services in connection therwith, and CSC for various computer-related services, likely to cause confusion, noting that “the inclusion of ‘ADVANCED BUSINESS SYSTEMS’ as a feature of applicant’s mark is not likely to help customers . . . distinguish the source of each party’s service”);
<i> In re Equitable Bancorporation</i>, 229 USPQ 709, 711 (TTAB 1986) (holding RESPONSE and RESPONSE CARD (with “CARD” disclaimed), both for banking services, likely to cause confusion, noting that “the addition of descriptive matter to one of two otherwise similar, nondescriptive marks will not serve to avoid a likelihood of confusion”);
<i> In re Apparel Ventures, Inc.</i>, 229 USPQ 225, 226 (TTAB 1986) (holding applicant's mark, SPARKS BY SASSAFRAS (stylized), for clothing, and registrant's mark, SPARKS (stylized), for footwear, likely to cause confusion, noting that “[t]hose already familiar with registrant’s use of its mark in connection with its goods, upon encountering applicant’s mark on applicant’s goods, could easily assume that ‘sassafras’ is some sort of house mark that may be used with only some of the ‘SPARKS’ goods”); <i>In re Corning Glass Works</i>, 229 USPQ 65, 66 (TTAB 1985) (holding CONFIRM for a buffered solution equilibrated to yield predetermined dissolved gas values in a blood-gas analyzer, and CONFIRMCELLS for diagnostic blood reagents for laboratory use, likely to cause confusion, noting that the relevant consumers would view the “CELLS” portion of CONFIRMCELLS as merely descriptive);
<i> In re U.S. Shoe Corp.</i>, 229 USPQ 707, 709 (TTAB 1985) (holding CAREER IMAGE (stylized) for clothing and retail women's clothing store services, and CREST CAREER IMAGES (stylized) for uniforms, likely to cause confusion, noting that CAREER IMAGE would be perceived by consumers as a shortened form of CREST CAREER IMAGES); <i> In re Energy Images, Inc.</i>, 227 USPQ 572, 573 (TTAB 1985) (holding SMART-SCAN (stylized) for optical line recognition and digitizing processors, and SMART for telemetry systems and remote-data gathering and control systems, likely to cause confusion, noting that, because of the descriptive significance of the term “SCAN,” it would be the portion of applicant’s mark that consumers would least likely rely upon to distinguish applicant’s goods); <i>In re Denisi</i>, 225 USPQ 624, 624 (TTAB 1985) (holding PERRY’S PIZZA and PERRY’S, both for restaurant services, likely to cause confusion, noting that “where a newcomer has appropriated the entire mark of a registrant, and has added to it a non-distinctive term, the marks are generally considered to be confusingly similar”);
<i> In re Riddle</i>, 225 USPQ 630, 632 (TTAB 1985) (holding RICHARD PETTY’S ACCU TUNE and design for automotive service stations, and ACCU-TUNE for automotive testing equipment, likely to cause confusion);
<i> In re Collegian Sportswear, Inc.</i>, 224 USPQ 174, 176 (TTAB 1984) (holding COLLEGIAN OF CALIFORNIA and design (with “CALIFORNIA” disclaimed), and COLLEGIENNE, both for items of clothing, likely to cause confusion, noting that the addition of “OF CALIFORNIA” would not obviate confusion because consumers might believe that such wording denotes a new product line from the same source);
<i> In re Pierre Fabre S.A.</i>, 188 USPQ 691, 692 (TTAB 1975) (holding PEDI-RELAX for foot cream with antiperspirant properties, and RELAX for antiperspirant, likely to cause confusion).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e8567">Additions or deletions to marks may be sufficient to avoid a likelihood of confusion if: (1) the marks in their entireties convey significantly different commercial impressions; or (2) the matter common to the marks is not likely to be perceived by purchasers as distinguishing source because it is merely descriptive or diluted. <i>See, e.g.,</i>
<i>Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Group, Inc.</i>, 637 F.3d 1344, 1356, 98 USPQ2d 1253, 1261 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (affirming TTAB’s holding that contemporaneous use of applicant’s CAPITAL CITY BANK marks for banking and financial services, and opposer’s CITIBANK marks for banking and financial services, is not likely cause confusion, based, in part, on findings that the phrase “City Bank” is frequently used in the banking industry and that ”CAPITAL” is the dominant element of applicant’s marks, which gives the marks a geographic connotation as well as a look and sound distinct from opposer’s marks); <i>Shen Mfg. Co. v. Ritz Hotel Ltd.</i>, 393 F.3d 1238, 1245, 73 USPQ2d 1350, 1356-57 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (reversing TTAB’s holding that contemporaneous use of THE RITZ KIDS for clothing items (including gloves) and RITZ for various kitchen textiles (including barbeque mitts) is likely to cause confusion, because, <i>inter alia</i>, THE RITZ KIDS creates a different commercial impression); <i>Safer, Inc. v. OMS Invs., Inc.,</i> 94 USPQ2d 1031, 1044-45 (TTAB 2010) (holding DEER-B-GON for animal repellant used to repel deer, other ruminant animals, and rabbits, and DEER AWAY and DEER AWAY PROFESSIONAL for repellant for repelling deer, other big game, and rabbits, not likely to cause confusion, noting that “DEER” is descriptive as applied to the relevant goods and thus has no source-indicating significance); <i>Bass Pro Trademarks, L.L.C. v. Sportsman’s Warehouse, Inc.</i>, 89 USPQ2d 1844, 1857-58 (TTAB 2008) (finding that, although cancellation petitioner’s and respondent’s marks were similar by virtue of the shared descriptive wording “SPORTSMAN’S WAREHOUSE,” this similarity was outweighed by differences in terms of sound, appearance, connotation, and commercial impression created by other matter and stylization in the respective marks); <i>In re Farm Fresh Catfish Co.</i>, 231 USPQ 495, 495-96 (TTAB 1986) (holding CATFISH BOBBERS (with “CATFISH” disclaimed) for fish, and BOBBER for restaurant services, not likely to cause confusion, because the word “BOBBER” has different connotation when used in connection with the respective goods and services);
<i> In re Shawnee Milling Co.</i>, 225 USPQ 747, 749 (TTAB 1985) (holding GOLDEN CRUST for flour, and ADOLPH’S GOLD’N CRUST and design (with “GOLD’N CRUST” disclaimed) for coating and seasoning for food items, not likely to cause confusion, noting that, because “GOLDEN CRUST” and “GOLD’N CRUST” are highly suggestive as applied to the respective goods, the addition of “ADOLPH’S” is sufficient to distinguish the marks);
<i> In re S.D. Fabrics, Inc.</i>, 223 USPQ 54, 55-56 (TTAB 1984) (holding DESIGNERS/FABRIC (stylized) for retail fabric store services, and DAN RIVER DESIGNER FABRICS and design for textile fabrics, not likely to cause confusion, noting that, because of the descriptive nature of “DESIGNERS/FABRIC” and “DESIGNER FABRICS,” the addition of “DAN RIVER” is sufficient to avoid a likelihood of confusion); <i>see also</i>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e8601">Similarity in sound is one factor in determining whether the marks are confusingly similar. <i>See In re E.

For purposes of the §2(d) analysis, there is no “correct” pronunciation of a mark because it is impossible to predict how the public will pronounce a particular mark; therefore, “correct” pronunciation cannot be relied on to avoid a likelihood of confusion. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>In re Viterra Inc.</i>, 671 F.3d 1358, 1367, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1912 (Fed.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e8647">The meaning or connotation of a mark must be determined in relation to the named goods or services.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e5616">1207.01(b)(vi)  Doctrine of Foreign Equivalents</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e8668">Under the doctrine of foreign equivalents, a foreign word (from a language familiar to an appreciable segment of American consumers) and the English equivalent may be held to be confusingly similar. <i>See, e.g.,</i>
<i>In re Thomas</i>, 79 USPQ2d 1021 (TTAB 2006) (holding MARCHE NOIR for jewelry, and BLACK MARKET MINERALS for retail jewelry and mineral store services, likely to cause confusion); <i>In re Am. Safety Razor Co.</i>, 2 USPQ2d 1459 (TTAB 1987) (holding BUENOS DIAS for soap, and GOOD MORNING and design for latherless shaving cream, likely to cause confusion);
<i> In re Hub Distrib., Inc.</i>, 218 USPQ 284 (TTAB 1983) (holding EL SOL for clothing and footwear, and SUN and design for footwear, likely to cause confusion).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e8680">Whether an examining attorney should apply the doctrine of foreign equivalents turns upon the significance of the foreign mark to the relevant purchasers, which is based on an analysis of the evidence of record, including, for example, dictionary, Internet, and LexisNexis® evidence. If the evidence shows that the relevant English translation is literal and direct, and no contradictory evidence of shades of meaning or other relevant meanings exists, the doctrine generally should be applied by the examining attorney. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>In re Ithaca Indus., Inc.</i>, 230 USPQ 702 (TTAB 1986) (holding LUPO for men’s and boys’ underwear, and WOLF and design for various clothing items, likely to cause confusion, because, <i>inter alia</i>, "LUPO" is clearly the foreign equivalent of the English word “wolf”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e8686">If an examining attorney determines that the doctrine is applicable, the examining attorney must also consider all other relevant <i>du</i>
<i>Pont</i> factors in assessing whether there is a likelihood of confusion. <i>See In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.</i>, 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973); <i>In re L’Oreal S.A.</i>, 222 USPQ 925, 926 (TTAB 1984) (noting that “similarity [of the marks] in connotation must be viewed as but a single factor in the overall evaluation of likelihood of confusion”).
</p>
<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e5649">1207.01(b)(vi)(A)  Background</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e8709">With respect to likelihood of confusion, “[i]t is well established that foreign words or terms are not entitled to be registered if the English language equivalent has been previously used on or registered for products which might reasonably be assumed to come from the same source.” <i>Mary Kay Cosmetics, Inc. v. Dorian Fragrances, Ltd.</i>, 180 USPQ 406, 407 (TTAB 1973).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e8715">Although words from modern languages are generally translated into English, the doctrine of foreign equivalents has evolved into a guideline, not an absolute rule, and is applied only when the “ordinary American purchaser” would “stop and translate” the foreign wording in a mark into its English equivalent. <i>Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee en 1772</i>, 396 F.3d 1369, 1377, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1696 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (reversing holding of likelihood of confusion where the marks were VEUVE ROYALE (the French equivalent of “Royal Widow”) and THE WIDOW, deeming it improbable that American purchasers would stop and translate “VEUVE” into “widow”). The “ordinary American purchaser” includes “all American purchasers, including those proficient in a non-English language who would ordinarily be expected to translate words into English.” <i>In re Spirits Int’l, N.V.</i>, 563 F.3d 1347, 1352, 90 USPQ2d 1489, 1492 (Fed. Cir. 2009).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e8721">With respect to the likelihood of confusion determination, the doctrine has been applied generally in the situation where the wording in one mark is entirely in English and the wording in the other mark or marks is entirely in a foreign language. <i>See, e.g., In re Perez</i>, 21 USPQ2d 1075 (TTAB 1991); <i>In re Am. Safety Razor Co.</i>, 2 USPQ2d 1459 (TTAB 1987); <i>In re Hub Distrib., Inc.</i>, 218 USPQ 284 (TTAB 1983). This is the most common scenario in the case law.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e8725">The Board, however, has applied the doctrine where the wording in both marks being compared is in the same foreign language. <i>See</i>
<i>In re Lar Mor Int’l, Inc.</i>, 221 USPQ 180, 181-83 (TTAB 1983) (noting that “[i]t seems to us that the fact that both marks may be comprised of foreign words should not mean that we can disregard their meanings” and translating the marks BIEN JOLIE and TRES JOLIE to compare their meanings, but concluding that confusion was not likely, despite their substantially similar meanings, because of, inter alia, the highly laudatory nature of the registered mark, BIEN JOLIE). In the <i>Lar Mor</i> case, the marks in question consisted of common French terms and, thus, it was perhaps more likely that the ordinary American purchaser would stop and translate such terms. <i>Cf.</i>
<i>Palm Bay Imps.</i>, 396 F.3d at 1377, 73 USPQ2d at 1692, 1696 (noting that the doctrine of foreign equivalents will not be applied when it is unlikely that an American buyer will translate a foreign mark and agreeing with TTAB’s determination that purchasers were unlikely to translate applicant’s French mark VEUVE ROYALE and opposer’s French marks VEUVE CLICQUOT PONSARDIN and VEUVE CLICQUOT, but concluding that confusion was likely because, <i>inter alia</i>, the presence of the arbitrary term “VEUVE” as the first word in both parties’ marks renders the marks similar); <i>Brown Shoe Co. v. Robbins</i>, 90 USPQ2d 1752, 1756 (TTAB 2009) (determining that the relevant circumstances of the case did not warrant application of the doctrine where the parties’ respective marks were the Spanish terms PALOMITA and PALOMA, but concluding that confusion was likely because, inter alia, the marks were substantially similar in appearance, pronunciation, meaning, and commercial impression).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-7d105e8743">The Board has also applied the doctrine in an inter partes case where the wording in one of the marks was in a foreign language and the wording in the other mark or marks was in a different foreign language. <i>See</i>
<i>Miguel Torres S.A. v. Casa Vinicola Gerardo Cesari S.R.L.</i>, 49 USPQ2d 2018 (TTAB 1998) (applying the doctrine and concluding that confusion was likely where the applicant’s mark featured the Italian wording DUE TORRI, meaning “two towers,” and the opposer’s marks featured the Spanish wording TORRES and TRES TORRES, meaning “towers” and “three towers” respectively), <i>vacated and remanded on other grounds</i>, 230 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (unpublished table decision). However, the Board has stated that, in general, it does not apply the doctrine where both marks are non-English words from two different foreign languages. <i>Brown Shoe Co.</i>, 90 USPQ2d at 1756; <i>see also Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Bel Canto Fancy Foods, Ltd.</i>, 5 USPQ2d 1980, 1982 (TTAB 1987) (“[T]his Board does not think it proper to take the French expression ‘bel air’ and the Italian expression ‘bel aria’ and then convert both into English and compare the English translations to determine whether there is similarity as to connotation . . . .”). One reason for not applying the doctrine where the marks are in different foreign languages is that it is less likely that the ordinary American purchaser would be fluent in two or more foreign languages. In <i>Miguel Torres</i>, the Board noted that the relevant marks were of such a nature that it was unnecessary for those encountering the relevant marks to be fluent in both Spanish and Italian to understand the connotations of the marks, because, for instance, a purchaser who is fluent in Spanish and familiar with meaning of the mark TORRES may be able to discern the meaning of a mark containing the Italian wording DUE TORRI and a design of two towers. 49 USPQ2d at 2021. In any case, the doctrine may not be as relevant, and certainly not the sole determinative factor, in a situation such as the <i>Miguel Torres</i> case where the marks are also similar in other respects.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-8d105e8755">The Board has yet to apply the doctrine in a published decision where the wording in one or more of the marks being compared consists of a combination of English and foreign-language words or terms. In such a case, the issue would likely remain whether the ordinary American purchaser would stop and translate these combined-language marks. The sufficiency of the translation evidence, the nature of the combined foreign and English wording (i.e., whether the wording is arbitrary, suggestive, generic, etc.), and any other relevant facts and evidence should be considered in these cases.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e8767">Issues regarding the doctrine of foreign equivalents arise early in examination, that is, at the time of conducting a search for confusingly similar marks. The search of foreign words in an applied-for mark must include a search of their English translation to ensure that all possible conflicting registrations and prior-filed applications have been identified in the event that the doctrine applies.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e8776">After conducting a complete search, an examining attorney must then assess whether a refusal under §2(d) may be warranted. If so, the examining attorney should research the English translation further using available resources, such as dictionaries, the Internet, and LexisNexis®, to ascertain whether there is sufficient evidence to support applying the doctrine.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e8779">As discussed below, if the evidence shows that the English translation is “literal and direct,” with no contradictory evidence of other relevant meanings or shades of meaning, then the doctrine should be applied, barring unusual circumstances. Further, if in its response to the application of the doctrine applicant argues that the foreign language is rare, obscure, or dead, then the examining attorney will need to provide evidence that the foreign language is a common, modern language.

<i>English Translations – Literal and Direct</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-7d105e8786">The Federal Circuit has stated that “[t]he test to be applied to a foreign word vis-a-vis an English word with respect to equivalency is not less stringent than that applicable to two English words.” <i>In re Sarkli, Ltd.</i>, 721 F.2d 353, 354, 220 USPQ 111, 113 (Fed. Cir. 1983).
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b210_2c894">Thus, the English translation evidence is a critical factor for the Board and the courts when determining whether to apply the doctrine. If the translation evidence shows that the English translation is unambiguously literal and direct, with no other relevant connotations or variations in meaning, the doctrine has generally been applied, and, therefore, should be applied by the examining attorney. <i>See</i>
<i>In re La Peregrina Ltd.</i>, 86 USPQ2d 1645, 1648-50 (TTAB 2008) (holding LA PEREGRINA for jewelry, pearls, pearl jewelry, and precious stones, and PILGRIM for jewelry, likely to cause confusion, where dictionary evidence showed that “pilgrim” is an exact translation of “peregrina” and there was no other dictionary evidence to the contrary); <i>In re Thomas</i>, 79 USPQ2d 1021, 1024-25 (TTAB 2006) (holding MARCHE NOIR for jewelry, and BLACK MARKET MINERALS for retail jewelry and mineral store services, likely to cause confusion, where the evidence showed “MARCHE NOIR” is the exact French equivalent of the English idiom “Black Market”); <i>In re Ithaca Indus., Inc.</i>, 230 USPQ 702, 704 (TTAB 1986) (LUPO for men’s and boys’ underwear, and WOLF and design for various clothing items, likely to cause confusion, where there was no dispute that “LUPO” is the Italian equivalent of “wolf”); <i>In re Hub Distrib., Inc.</i>, 218 USPQ 284, 284-85 (TTAB 1983) (holding EL SOL for clothing, and SUN and design for footwear, likely to cause confusion, where “EL SOL” was determined to be the “direct foreign language equivalent” of the term “sun”); <i>see also Ex parte Odol-Werke Wien GmbH.</i>, 111 USPQ 286, 286 (Comm’r Pats. 1956) (finding the French language mark CHAT NOIR and its English language equivalent BLACK CAT confusingly similar because “’CHAT NOIR’ undoubtedly means, and is the same as, ‘Black Cat’ to a substantial segment” of the relevant purchasers).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-8d105e8803">When determining the appropriate English translation of the foreign wording in the mark, an examining attorney should view the translations in the context of any significant features in the mark, such as design or wording elements, the identified goods and/or services in the application, the relevant marketplace, and the specimen. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>In re Perez</i>, 21 USPQ2d 1075, 1076-77 (TTAB 1991) (holding EL GALLO for fresh vegetables, and ROOSTER for fresh citrus fruit, likely to cause confusion, rejecting applicant’s argument that purchasers would ascribe other meanings to “gallo,” where ”rooster” was the first English translation listed in a Spanish-English language dictionary entry for “gallo,” where “gallo” was the only listed Spanish translation in a dictionary entry for ”rooster,” and where the design of a rooster on the specimen reinforced the translation of “GALLO”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-10d105e8815">Where the evidence shows that the English translation is not exact, literal, or direct, the doctrine of foreign equivalents has generally not been applied to find the marks confusingly similar. <i>See Sarkli</i>, 721 F.2d at 354-55, 220 USPQ at 112-13 (holding REPECHAGE for various skin-care products, and SECOND CHANCE for face creams and other toiletries, not likely to cause confusion, where the evidence failed to show that the terms were direct foreign equivalents); <i>see also</i>
<i>In re Buckner Enters.</i>, 6 USPQ2d 1316 (TTAB 1987) (holding DOVE (with design) for stoves and furnaces, and PALOMA for various forms of gas heating apparatus, not likely to cause confusion, because, <i>inter alia</i>, the Spanish word “paloma” and the English word “dove” are not exact synonyms in that “paloma” can be translated into either “dove” or “pigeon”). Thus, several translation dictionaries showing variations in the English meaning constitute evidence that the foreign word or term may not have a literal and direct translation, and the doctrine should not be applied.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-12d105e8825">
<i>Common, Modern Foreign Languages</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-13d105e8828">The doctrine applies to words or terms from common, modern languages, which encompasses all but dead, obscure, or unusual languages. <i>See Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee en 1772</i>, 396 F.3d 1369, 1377, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1696 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Thus, an examining attorney should provide evidence to show that the foreign language is a common, modern language. The type of evidence will vary depending on the particular facts of the case but, if available, the examining attorney should provide evidence of the percentage or number of United States consumers who speak the language in question. For example:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull"> Census evidence provided by applicant, showing that only 0.6% of the American population speak French “very well” or “well,” was used by the Board against the applicant to find that French is a commonly spoken language and that, of the foreign languages with the greatest number of speakers in the United States, French was second only to Spanish. <i>Thomas</i>, 79 USPQ2d at 1024.
</li>
<li class="nobull"> Evidence showing that 706,000 Russian-speakers live in the United States was persuasive evidence to establish that a “significant portion of consumers” would understand the English meaning of the Russian mark for Russian vodka. <i>In re Joint Stock Co. “Baik,”</i> 80 USPQ2d 1305, 1310 (TTAB 2006).
</li>
</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-15d105e8846">Census evidence identifying the number of people who speak various foreign languages in the United States can be found at 

<a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/" target="_blank">http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/language/</a>
. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-16d105e8852">If such evidence is unavailable or unpersuasive, the examining attorney may instead provide other evidence that the language in question is a common, modern language by establishing, for example, that the foreign country where the language is spoken is a prominent trading partner of the United States or that the foreign language is spoken by a sizeable world population. Such evidence may be obtained from the USPTO’s Translations Branch, as well as the Internet, LexisNexis®, and any other relevant electronic or print resources.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-18d105e8868">If evidence shows that the language at issue is highly obscure or a dead language, the doctrine will generally not be applied. <i>See Palm Bay Imps.</i>, 396 F.3d at 1377, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1696; <i>cf. In re Spirits Int’l, N.V.</i>, 563 F.3d 1347, 1351, 90 USPQ2d 1489, 1491 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (indicating that the doctrine of foreign equivalents does not require that terms from dead or obscure languages be literally translated for the purpose of determining descriptiveness). The determination of whether a language is “dead” is made on a case-by-case basis, based upon the meaning the word or term would have to the relevant purchasing public. For example, Latin is generally considered a dead language. However, if evidence shows that a Latin term is still in use by the relevant purchasing public (i.e., if the term appears in current dictionaries or news articles), then this Latin term would not be considered dead. The same analysis is applied to other words or terms from uncommon or obscure languages.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-19d105e8881">
<i>Other Considerations: Alternate Meaning of Mark and Marketplace Circumstances of the Commercial Setting in Which the Mark is Used</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-20d105e8884">The Board may also review the evidence of record to determine the following:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull">(1) Whether the foreign wording has a meaning in the relevant marketplace that differs from the translated meaning in English; and/or
</li>
<li class="nobull">(2) Whether it is more or less likely that the foreign expression will be translated by purchasers because of the manner in which the term is encountered in the marketing environment as used in connection with the goods and/or services.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-22d105e8904">
<i>See Thomas</i>, 79 USPQ2d at 1025-26; <i>see also In re Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co.</i>, 223 USPQ 45, 45-46 (TTAB 1983) (considering whether purchasers would be likely to translate the mark “KUHLBRAU” into its merely descriptive English equivalent, “cool brew”). In making such determinations, the Board generally reviews evidence such as dictionary definitions, declarations, and specimens.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-23d105e8917">Typically, the doctrine will not be applied where the foreign wording has developed an alternate meaning in the relevant marketplace that is different from the translated meaning in English, and the evidence shows that the alternate meaning would be understood by the relevant purchasing public. <i>See La Peregrina</i>, 86 USPQ2d at 1649 (finding that if sufficient evidence had been provided to show that the Spanish-language mark LA PEREGRINA, which translates to mean “the pilgrim,” for goods including pearls and pearl jewelry, was viewed by the relevant purchasing public as the “name of a very famous and unique pearl,” such would be a situation “where purchasers would not translate the name”); <i>cf. Cont’l Nut Co. v. Le Cordon Bleu S.a.r.l.</i>, 494 F.2d 1395, 1396-97, 181 USPQ 646, 647 (C.C.P.A. 1974) (finding that applicant’s ownership of a prior registration for “BLUE RIBBON” did not preclude opposer from asserting damage resulting from applicant’s registration of the mark CORDON BLEU, (which literally translates to “blue ribbon”) because CORDON BLEU would not be translated by, or have the same significance to, an American purchaser in view of the adoption by the English language of the wording CORDON BLEU, as evidenced by American English dictionary entries indicating that such wording refers to a highly skilled cook).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-24d105e8928">The doctrine also typically will not be applied where the record indicates that it is unlikely purchasers would translate the mark because of “marketplace circumstances or the commercial setting in which the mark is used.” <i>La Peregrina</i>, 86 USPQ2d at 1648; <i>see also Thomas</i>, 79 USPQ2d at 1026 (finding “MARCHE NOIR” confusingly similar to “BLACK MARKET MINERALS,” but suggesting that a different conclusion might have been reached if the marketplace circumstances or commercial setting in which the mark was used were such that it would be unlikely for purchasers to translate “MARCHE NOIR”); <i>In re Tia Maria, Inc.</i>, 188 USPQ 524, 525-26 (TTAB 1975) (holding TIA MARIA (which translates to “Aunt Mary”) for restaurant services, and AUNT MARY’S for canned fruits and vegetables, not likely to cause confusion, because, inter alia, a person dining at the TIA MARIA restaurant surrounded by its Mexican décor and Mexican food, would be likely to accept “TIA MARIA” as it is and not translate it into “AUNT MARY”).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e8954">If the examining attorney has sufficient evidence to show that foreign wording comprising a mark has a relevant, literal, and direct English translation such that the foreign wording has an English language equivalent, then the doctrine generally should be applied. However, applying the doctrine is only part of the process of determining whether the marks being compared are confusingly similar. Appearance, sound, meaning, and overall commercial impression are also factors to be considered when comparing marks. <i>See</i>
<i>Palm Bay Imps. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee en 1772</i>, 396 F.3d 1369, 1371, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing <i>In re E.I.</i>
<i>du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.</i>, 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973); <i>In re Ness &amp; Co.</i>, 18 USPQ2d 1815, 1816 (TTAB 1991) (“’[S]uch similarity as there is in connotation [between the foreign word mark and the English word mark] must be weighed against the dissimilarity in appearance, sound, and all other factors, before reaching a conclusion on likelihood of confusion as to source.’” (quoting <i>In re Sarkli, Ltd</i>., 721 F.2d 353, 354, 220 USPQ 111, 113 (Fed.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e8963">Similarity of the marks in one respect – sight, sound, or meaning – does not automatically result in a finding of likelihood of confusion even if the goods are identical or closely related; rather, the rule is that, taking into account all of the relevant facts of a particular case, similarity as to one factor alone may be sufficient to support a holding that the marks are confusingly similar. <i>See</i>
<i>In re Thor Tech, Inc.</i>, 90 USPQ2d 1634, 1635 (TTAB 2009); <i>In re White Swan Ltd.</i>, 8 USPQ2d 1534, 1535 (TTAB 1988);

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e8969">For example, if the English and foreign marks being compared are weak or highly suggestive, or have additional wording or matter that serves to distinguish the marks, then regardless of application of the doctrine and similarity in meaning, the marks may not be considered confusingly similar. <i>See</i>
<i> Ness &amp; Co.</i>, 18 USPQ2d at 1816 (holding GOOD-NESS for cheese and meats, and LABONTE (which translates to “the goodness”) for cheese, not likely cause confusion, because of the laudatory nature of the term "goodness," the dissimilarity of the marks in appearance and sound, the slight differences in meaning of the marks, and the connotation of the mark GOOD-NESS in relation to applicant’s company name “Ness &amp; Co.”); <i>In re L’Oreal S.A.</i>, 222 USPQ 925, 925-26 (TTAB 1984) (considering the English translation of the French mark HAUTE MODE (meaning “high fashion” in English), but concluding that contemporaneous use with the HI-FASHION SAMPLER was not likely to cause confusion, because of, <i>inter alia</i>, the "less than wholly arbitrary nature of the marks" and the differences in the marks, including the addition of the term SAMPLER in the English-language mark).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e8976">If both marks being compared are in a foreign language and have the same or a very similar meaning when translated, the following factors should also be assessed: (1) whether the English meaning of the marks is weak or highly suggestive with respect to the goods and/or services; and (2) whether the marks being compared are similar in sound and/or appearance in addition to having the same or similar meaning. If the marks are not weak or highly suggestive and are similar in meaning and sound, they may be found to be confusingly similar. <i>See</i>
<i>Miguel Torres S.A v. Casa Vinicola Gerardo Cesari S.R. L.</i>, 49 USPQ2d 2018 (applying the doctrine and concluding that confusion was likely where the applicant’s mark featured the Italian wording DUE TORRI, meaning “two towers,” and opposer's marks featured the Spanish wording TORRES and TRES TORRES, meaning “towers” and “three towers” respectively, because the marks were similar not only in connotation but also in sound) , vacated and remanded on other grounds, 230 F.3d 1372 (Fed.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-7d105e8982">In addition, when comparing only foreign language marks, even if it is determined that the marks are not likely to be translated by purchasers, the marks may still be found confusingly similar for other reasons, such as similarity in sound and/or appearance. <i>See</i>
<i>Palm Bay Imps.</i>, 396 F.3d at 1372-73, 1377, 73 USPQ2d at 1691, 1696 (agreeing with Board’s finding that purchasers would not translate into English applicant’s French mark VEUVE ROYALE and opposer’s French marks VEUVE CLICQUOT PONSARDIN and VEUVE CLICQUOT, and upholding the Board’s determination that confusion was nonetheless likely as to these marks, because, <i>inter alia</i>, “the presence of [the] strong distinctive term [VEUVE] as the first word in both parties’ marks renders the marks similar, especially in light of the largely laudatory . . . significance of the word ROYALE”).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9005">Where the primary difference between marks is the transposition of the elements that compose the marks, and where this transposition does not change the overall commercial impression, there may be a likelihood of confusion. <i>See, e.g., In re Wine Soc’y of Am. Inc.</i>, 12 USPQ2d 1139, 1142 (TTAB 1989) (holding THE WINE SOCIETY OF AMERICA and design for wine club membership services including the supplying of printed materials, and AMERICAN WINE SOCIETY 1967 and design for newsletters, bulletins, and journals, likely to cause confusion); <i>In re Nationwide Indus., Inc.</i>, 6 USPQ2d 1882, 1884 (TTAB 1988) (holding RUST BUSTER (with “RUST” disclaimed) for rust-penetrating spray lubricant, and BUST RUST for penetrating oil, likely to cause confusion); <i>In re Gen.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e9017">However, if the transposed mark creates a distinctly different commercial impression, then confusion is not likely. <i>See, e.g., In re Best Prods.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e5885">1207.01(b)(viii)  Marks Consisting of Multiple Words</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9033">When assessing the likelihood of confusion between compound word marks, one must determine whether a portion of the word mark is dominant in terms of creating the commercial impression. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has noted that “in articulating reasons for reaching a conclusion on the issue of confusion, there is nothing improper in stating that, for rational reasons, more or less weight has been given to a particular feature of a mark, provided the ultimate conclusion rests on consideration of the marks in their entireties.” <i>In re Nat’l Data Corp.</i>, 753 F.2d 1056, 1058, 224 USPQ 749, 750-51 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Although there is no mechanical test to select a “dominant” element of a compound word mark, consumers would be more likely to perceive a fanciful or arbitrary term, rather than a descriptive or generic term, as the source-indicating feature of the mark. <i>See, e.g., In re Dixie Rests., Inc.</i>, 105 F.3d 1405, 1407, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (affirming TTAB’s finding that “DELTA,” not the disclaimed generic term “CAFE,” is the dominant portion of the mark THE DELTA CAFE); <i>In re Binion</i>, 93 USPQ2d 1531, 1534 (TTAB 2009) (finding that “BINION’S,” not the disclaimed descriptive wording “ROADHOUSE,” is the dominant portion of the mark BINION’S ROADHOUSE). Accordingly, if two marks for related goods or services share identical or similar dominant features and the marks, when viewed in their entireties, create similar overall commercial impressions, then confusion is likely. <i>See, e.g., In re Cynosure, Inc.</i>, 90 USPQ2d 1644 (TTAB 2009) (holding CYNERGY for medical lasers for, <i>inter alia</i>, treatment of the face and skin, and SYNERGIE PEEL for medical devices for microdermabrasion, likely to cause confusion, noting that “SYNERGIE” is the dominant portion of the cited mark and “PEEL” is insufficient to distinguish the marks); <i>In re J.M. Originals Inc.</i>, 6 USPQ2d 1393 (TTAB 1987) (holding JM ORIGINALS (with “ORIGINALS” disclaimed) for various items of apparel, and JM COLLECTABLES for sport shirts, likely to cause confusion).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e9039">If the common element of two marks is “weak” in that it is generic, descriptive, or highly suggestive of the named goods or services, it is unlikely that consumers will be confused unless the overall combinations have other commonality. <i>See, e.g., In re Bed &amp; Breakfast Registry</i>, 791 F.2d 157, 159 229 USPQ 818, 819 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (reversing TTAB’s holding that contemporaneous use of BED &amp; BREAKFAST REGISTRY for making lodging reservations for others in private homes, and BED &amp; BREAKFAST INTERNATIONAL for room booking agency services, is likely to cause confusion, because, inter alia, the descriptive nature of the shared wording weighed against a finding that the marks are confusingly similar);

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9115">The fact that a mark is intended to be a parody of another trademark is not, by itself, sufficient to overcome a likelihood of confusion refusal, because “[t]here are confusing parodies and non-confusing parodies.” J. Thomas McCarthy, <i>McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition</i>, §31.153 (4th ed. 2010); <i>see also</i>
<i>Nike, Inc. v. Maher</i>, 100 USPQ2d 1018, 1023 (TTAB 2011) (“[P]arody is not a defense if the marks would otherwise be considered confusingly similar.”). “A true parody actually decreases the likelihood of confusion because the effect of the parody is to create a distinction in the viewer’s mind between the actual product and the joke.” <i>Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co. v. Novak</i>, 648 F. Supp. 905, 910, 231 USPQ 963, 965 (D. Neb. 1986), aff’d, 836 F.2d 397, 5 USPQ2d 1314 (8th Cir. 1987). Thus, ”[w]hile a parody must call to mind the actual product to be successful, the same success also necessarily distinguishes the parody from the actual product.” <i>Id.</i>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e9127">Cases involving a discussion of parody include the following: <i>Research in Motion Ltd. v. Defining Presence Mktg. Grp., Inc.</i>, 102 USPQ2d 1187, 1192 (TTAB 2012) (sustaining oppositions to applications for the mark CRACKBERRY, for a variety of online computer services and clothing items, on the bases of a likelihood of confusion and likelihood of dilution by blurring with the mark BLACKBERRY, for handheld devices, including smartphones, and related goods and services, noting that “likelihood of confusion will usually trump any First Amendment concerns”); <i>Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC v. Ruben</i>, 78 USPQ2d 1741 (TTAB 2006) (holding contemporaneous use of applicant’s mark, LESSBUCKS COFFEE, and opposer’s marks, STARBUCKS and STARBUCKS COFFEE, for identical goods and services, likely to cause confusion, noting that “parody is unavailing to applicant as an outright defense and, further, does not serve to distinguish the marks”); <i>Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc. v. Miller</i>, 211 USPQ 816, 820 (TTAB 1981) (holding CLOTHES ENCOUNTERS for clothing, and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND for t-shirts, likely to cause confusion, noting that the “right of the public to use words in the English language in a humorous and parodic manner does not extend to use of such words as trademarks if such use conflicts with the prior use and/or registration of the substantially same mark by another”); <i>see also Jordache Enters. v. Hogg Wyld Ltd.</i>, 828 F.2d 1482, 4 USPQ2d 1216, 1220, 1222 (10
<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1987) (noting that “a parody of an existing trademark can cause a likelihood of confusion,” but affirming district court’s holding that contemporaneous use of LARDASHE and JORDACHE, both for jeans, is not likely to cause confusion).

<p id="ch1200_d1fd11_1965b_72">When the marks at issue are both color marks, the test is not whether the marks can be distinguished when subjected to a side-by-side comparison, but rather whether the marks are sufficiently similar in terms of their appearance and overall commercial impression so that confusion as to the source of the goods/services offered under the respective marks is likely to result. <i>In re Cook Med. Tech. LLC</i>, 105 USPQ2d 1377, 1381 (TTAB 2012). In
<i> In re Cook Med. Tech</i>., the Board affirmed a refusal to register the color "teal" for "medical devices, namely, guiding sheaths for use in conjunction with access needles, wire guides, and dilators for providing access for diagnostic and interventional devices in vascular and non-vascular procedures," finding the mark likely to cause confusion with a registered mark for the color "blue" applied to the tip and indwelling length of catheters. <i>Id</i>., 105 USPQ2d at 1385. Because registrant’s “blue” mark was not limited to a particular shade of blue, it covered all shades of blue, including applicant’s “teal.” <i>Id</i>., 105 USPQ2d at 1382. Further, the Board found that, in the context of the goods at issue, the marks were similar in color, noting that the original description of applicant’s mark identified it as the color "blue/teal," and that the goods were complementary <i>Id</i>., 105 USPQ2d at 1380, 82-83.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e5973">1207.01(c)  Design Marks</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9148">When the marks at issue are both design marks, the similarity of the marks must be decided primarily on the basis of visual similarity. <i>E.g., In re Vienna Sausage Mfg. Co.</i>, 16 USPQ2d 2044, 2047 (TTAB 1990). In this situation, consideration must be given to the fact that the marks usually will not be viewed side-by-side in the marketplace and a purchaser’s recollection of design marks is often of a general, rather than specific, nature; thus the marks may be confusingly similar despite differences between them. <i>See, e.g., In re United Serv. Distribs., Inc.</i>, 229 USPQ 237 (TTAB 1986) (holding mark consisting of a design featuring silhouettes of a man and woman, used in connection with distributorship services in the field of health and beauty aids, and mark consisting of a design featuring silhouettes of a man and woman, used in connection with skin cream, likely to cause confusion); <i>In re Steury Corp.</i>, 189 USPQ 353 (TTAB 1975) (holding mark consisting of three generally horizontal bars, for, <i>inter alia</i>, boats, campers, and travel trailers, and mark consisting of two generally horizontal bars, for, inter alia, boats, campers, and travel trailers, likely to cause confusion); <i>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Sanders Assocs., Inc.</i>, 177 USPQ 720 (TTAB 1973) (holding mark consisting of a triangular arrow design within a square border, for various items of electrical and electronic equipment, and mark consisting of a triangular arrow design, for various items of electrical and electronic equipment, likely to cause confusion); <i>cf. Red Carpet Corp. v. Johnstown Am. Enters.</i>, 7 USPQ2d 1404 (TTAB 1988) (holding mark consisting of a highly stylized house design for use in connection with real estate property management, and mark consisting of a highly stylized house design for use in connection with real estate brokerage services, not likely to cause confusion); <i>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. v. Ocean Garden Prods., Inc.</i>, 223 USPQ 1027 (TTAB 1984) (holding mark consisting of a circle containing three curved lines with rounded ends, for seafood, and mark consisting of a stylized breaking wave within an oval, for various food items including juices and fruits, not likely to cause confusion).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9174">Under the doctrine of legal equivalents, which is based on a recognition that a pictorial depiction and equivalent wording are likely to impress the same mental image on purchasers, a design mark may be found to be confusingly similar to a word mark consisting of the design's literal equivalent. <i>See, e.g., In re Rolf Nilsson AB</i>, 230 USPQ 141 (TTAB 1986) (holding applicant’s mark consisting of a silhouette of a lion’s head and the letter “L,” for shoes, and registrant’s mark, LION, for shoes, likely to cause confusion); <i>Puma-Sportschuhfabriken Rudolf Dassler KG v. Garan, Inc.</i>, 224 USPQ 1064 (TTAB 1984) (holding applicant’s marks featuring a design of a mountain lion, for clothing items, and opposer’s marks, a puma design and PUMA (with and without puma design), for items of clothing and sporting goods, likely to cause confusion); <i>In re Duofold Inc.</i>, 184 USPQ 638 (TTAB 1974) (holding mark consisting of a design of an eagle lined for the color gold, for sports apparel, and mark consisting of GOLDEN EAGLE and design of an eagle, for various items of clothing, likely to cause confusion).
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b211_28333">Where, however, a pictorial representation in a mark is so highly stylized or abstract that it would not readily evoke in the purchaser’s mind the wording featured in another mark, the marks may not be confusingly similar. <i>See, e.g., In re Serac, Inc.</i>, 218 USPQ 340, 341 (TTAB 1983) (concluding that applicant’s design mark was “so highly stylized that an image of a ram’s head would not be immediately discerned and the connection with [the registered mark] ‘RAM’s HEAD’ would not be readily evoked with the resulting generation of a likelihood of source confusion”).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9195">Often, the examining attorney must determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists between composite marks that consist of a design element combined with words and/or letters. Frequently, the marks at issue are similar in only one element. Although it is not proper to dissect a mark, if one feature of a mark is more significant than another feature, greater weight may be given to the dominant feature for purposes of determining likelihood of confusion. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>In re Viterra Inc.</i>, 671 F.3d 1358, 1362, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1908 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <i>Giant Food, Inc. v. Nation’s Foodservice, Inc.</i>, 710 F.2d 1565, 1570-71, 218 USPQ 390, 395 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <i>see also</i>

<a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e5475">TMEP §1207.01(b)(iii)</a>
. However, the fundamental rule in this situation is that the marks must be considered in their entireties. <i>See In re Shell Oil Co.</i>, 992 F.2d 1204, 1206, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1688 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <i>Massey Junior Coll., Inc. v. Fashion Inst. of Tech.</i>, 492 F.2d 1399, 1402, 181 USPQ 272, 273-74 (C.C.P.A. 1974).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e9204">If a mark comprises both wording and a design, greater weight is often given to the wording, because it is the wording that purchasers would use to refer to or request the goods or services. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>Viterra</i>, 671 F.3d at 1366, 101 USPQ2d at 1911; <i>In re Max Capital Grp. Ltd.</i>, 93 USPQ2d 1243, 1247 (TTAB 2010); <i>In re Appetito Provisions Co. Inc.</i>, 3 USPQ2d 1553, 1554 (TTAB 1987). The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has cautioned, however, that “[t]here is no general rule as to whether letters or designs will dominate in composite marks; nor is the dominance of letters or design dispositive of the issue.” <i>In re Electrolyte Labs. Inc.</i>, 929 F.2d 645, 647, 16 USPQ2d 1239, 1240 (Fed. Cir. 1990).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e9213">The comparison of composite marks must be done on a case-by-case basis, without reliance on mechanical rules of construction. <i>See, e.g., Spice Islands, Inc. v. Frank Tea &amp; Spice Co.</i>, 505 F.2d 1293, 184 USPQ 35 (C.C.P.A. 1974) (reversing TTAB’s holding that SPICE TREE with tree design, for garlic powder and minced onion, and SPICE ISLANDS with and without tree design, for seasoning herbs and spices, is not likely to cause confusion); <i>In re White Rock Distilleries Inc.</i>, 92 USPQ2d 1282 (TTAB 2009) (holding VOLTA for vodka infused with caffeine, and TERZA VOLTA and vine shoot design for wines, not likely to cause confusion); <i>In re Sun Supermarkets, Inc.</i>, 228 USPQ 693 (TTAB 1986) (holding applicant’s mark, SUN SUPERMARKETS with sun design, for retail supermarket services, and registrant’s marks, SUNSHINE and SUNRISE (both with sun designs), for retail grocery store services, likely to cause confusion).

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e6043">1207.01(c)(iii)  Comparison of Standard Character Marks and Special Form Marks</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9238">If a mark (in either an application or a registration) is presented in standard characters, the owner of the mark is not limited to any particular depiction of the mark. <i>Cunningham v. Laser Golf Corp.</i>, 222 F.3d 943, 950, 55 USPQ2d 1842, 1847 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <i>In re Cox Enters.</i>, 82 USPQ2d 1040, 1044 (TTAB 2007). The rights associated with a mark in standard characters reside in the wording (or other literal element, e.g., letters, numerals, punctuation) and not in any particular display. <i>In re White Rock Distilleries Inc.</i>, 92 USPQ2d 1282, 1284 (TTAB 2009). A registrant is entitled to all depictions of a standard character mark regardless of the font style, size, or color, and not merely "reasonable manners" of depicting such mark. <i>See</i>
<i>In re Viterra Inc.</i>, 671 F.3d 1358, 1364-65, 101 USPQ2d 1905, 1910 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <i>Citigroup Inc. v. Capital City Bank Group, Inc.</i>, 637 F.3d 1344, 1353, 98 USPQ2d 1253, 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Therefore, an applicant cannot, by presenting its mark in special form, avoid likelihood of confusion with a mark that is registered in standard characters because the registered mark presumably could be used in the same manner of display. <i>See, e.g., In re RSI Sys., LLC</i>, 88 USPQ2d 1445, 1448 (TTAB 2008); <i>In re Melville Corp.</i>, 18 USPQ2d 1386, 1388 (TTAB 1991); <i>In re Pollio Dairy Prods. Corp.</i>, 8 USPQ2d 2012, 2015 (TTAB 1988). Likewise, the fact that an applied-for mark is presented in standard character form would not, by itself, be sufficient to distinguish it from a similar mark in special form. <i>See, e.g., In re Mighty Leaf Tea</i>, 601 F.3d 1342, 1348, 94 USPQ2d 1257, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <i>Sunnen Prods. Co. v. Sunex Int’l, Inc.</i>, 1 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (TTAB 1987); <i>In re Hester Indus., Inc.</i>, 231 USPQ 881, 882 n.6 (TTAB 1986).

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e6101">1207.01(d)(iii)  Third-Party Registrations and Evidence of Third-Party Use</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9325">Generally, the existence of third-party registrations cannot justify the registration of another mark that is so similar to a previously registered mark as to create a likelihood of confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive. <i>E.g., In re Max Capital Grp. Ltd.</i>, 93 USPQ2d 1243, 1248 (TTAB 2010); <i>In re Toshiba Med. Sys. Corp.</i>, 91 USPQ2d 1266, 1272 (TTAB 2009). However, third-party registrations may be relevant to show that a mark or a portion of a mark is descriptive, suggestive, or so commonly used that the public will look to other elements to distinguish the source of the goods or services. <i>See, e.g.</i>, <i>In re Hartz Hotel Servs., Inc.</i>, 102 USPQ2d 1150, 1153-54 (TTAB 2012); <i>In re Melville Corp.</i>, 18 USPQ2d 1386, 1388 (TTAB 1991); <i>In re Dayco Products-Eaglemotive Inc.</i>, 9 USPQ2d 1910, 1911-12 (TTAB 1988); <i>Plus Prods. v. Star-Kist Foods, Inc.</i>, 220 USPQ 541, 544 (TTAB 1983). Properly used in this limited manner, third-party registrations are similar to dictionaries showing how language is generally used. <i>See, e.g., Tektronix, Inc. v. Daktronics, Inc.</i>, 534 F.2d 915, 917, 189 USPQ 693, 694-95 (C.C.P.A. 1976); <i>In re J.M. Originals Inc.</i>, 6 USPQ2d 1393, 1394 (TTAB 1987); <i>United Foods Inc. v. J.R. Simplot Co.</i>, 4 USPQ2d 1172, 1174 (TTAB 1987).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e9353">Third-party registrations that cover a number of different goods or services may have some probative value to the extent that they may serve to suggest that goods or services are of a type that may emanate from a single source, if the registrations are based on use in commerce. <i>In re Mucky Duck Mustard Co.</i>, 6 USPQ2d 1467, 1470 n.6 (TTAB), <i>aff’d per curiam</i>, 864 F.2d 149 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <i>see also In re Princeton Tectonics, Inc.</i>, 95 USPQ2d 1509, 1511 (TTAB 2010) (“While third-party registrations can play an important role in establishing that the types of goods at issue are related, examining attorneys must review the registrations carefully to ensure that each registration presented is probative and that the number of registrations is sufficient, along with other types of evidence, to establish that the types of goods at issue are related.”). Third-party registrations that are not based on use in commerce, such as those registered under §66 of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. §1141f(a)), or those registered solely under §44 of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. §1126(e)), and for which no §8 or §71 affidavits or declarations of continuing use have been filed (15 U.S.C. §1058), have very little, if any, persuasive value. <i>See Calypso Tech., Inc. v. Calypso Capital Mgmt., LP</i>, 100 USPQ2d 1213, 1221 n.15 (TTAB 2011); <i>In re 1st USA Realty Prof’ls, Inc.</i>, 84 USPQ2d 1581, 1583 (TTAB 2007); <i>In re Albert Trostel &amp; Sons Co.</i>, 29 USPQ2d 1783, 1786 (TTAB 1993).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e9365">A list of registrations or a copy of a search report is not proper evidence of third-party registrations. <i>See, e.g., In re Promo Ink</i>, 78 USPQ2d 1301, 1304 (TTAB 2006); <i>In re Dos Padres, Inc.</i>, 49 USPQ2d 1860, 1861 n.2 (TTAB 1998); TBMP §1208.02. To make registrations of record, copies of the registrations or the electronic equivalent thereof (i.e., printouts or electronic copies of the registrations taken from the electronic database of the USPTO) must be submitted. <i>In re Ruffin Gaming, LLC</i>, 66 USPQ2d 1924, 1925 n.3 (TTAB 2002); <i>In re Smith &amp; Mehaffey</i>, 31 USPQ2d 1531, 1532 n.3 (TTAB 1994);TBMP §1208.02;

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e9390">Evidence of third-party use falls under the sixth <i>du Pont</i> factor – the “number and nature of similar marks in use on similar goods.” <i>In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.</i>, 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973). If the evidence establishes that the consuming public is exposed to third-party use of similar marks on similar goods, it “is relevant to show that a mark is relatively weak and entitled to only a narrow scope of protection.” <i>Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee en 1772</i>, 396 F.3d 1369, 1373-74, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1693 (Fed. Cir. 2005).

During ex parte prosecution, an applicant will not be heard on matters that constitute a collateral attack on the cited registration (e.g., a registrant’s nonuse of the mark). <i>See In re Dixie Rests., Inc.</i>, 105 F.3d 1405, 1408, 41 USPQ2d 1531, 1534-35 (Fed.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1200d1e6229">1207.01(d)(viii)  Consent Agreements</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9493">The term “consent agreement” generally refers to an agreement between parties in which one party (e.g., a prior registrant) consents to the registration of a mark by the other party (e.g., an applicant for registration of the same mark or a similar mark), or in which each party consents to the registration of an identical or similar mark by the other party.
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b211_31477">An applicant may submit a consent agreement in an attempt to overcome a refusal of registration under §2(d) of the Act, or in anticipation of a refusal to register. However, an examining attorney may not solicit a consent agreement.
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b211_314b8">A consent agreement may take a number of different forms and arise under a variety of circumstances, but, when present, it is “but one factor to be taken into account with all of the other relevant circumstances bearing on the likelihood of confusion referred to in §2(d).” <i>In re N.A.D. Inc.</i>, 754 F.2d 996, 224 USPQ 969, 971 (Fed. Cir. 1985).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e9499">“Naked” consent agreements (i.e., agreements that contain little more than a prior registrant’s consent to registration of an applied-for mark and possibly a mere statement that source confusion is believed to be unlikely) are typically considered to be less persuasive than agreements that detail the particular reasons why the relevant parties believe no likelihood of confusion exists and specify the arrangements undertaken by the parties to avoid confusing the public. <i>See In re E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.</i>, 476 F.2d 1357, 1362, 177 USPQ 563, 568 (C.C.P.A 1973) (noting that “[i]n considering agreements, a naked ‘consent’ may carry little weight,” but “[t]he weight to be given more detailed agreements . . . should be substantial”); <i>see also In re Donnay Int’l, S.A.</i>, 31 USPQ2d 1953, 1956 (TTAB 1994) (“[T]he more information that is in the consent agreement as to why the parties believe confusion to be unlikely, and the more evidentiary support for such conclusions in the facts of record or in the way of undertakings by the parties, the more we can assume that the consent is based on a reasoned assessment of the marketplace, and consequently the more weight the consent will be accorded.”); <i>In re Permagrain Prods., Inc.</i>, 223 USPQ 147 (TTAB 1984) (finding a consent agreement submitted by applicant did not alter the conclusion that confusion was likely, because the agreement was “naked” in that it merely indicated that each party would recognize, and refrain from interfering with, the other’s use of their respective marks and that the applicant would not advertise or promote its mark without its company name, but the agreement did not restrict the markets or potential customers for their goods in such a way as to avoid confusion);
<i>cf. In re Wacker Neuson SE</i>, 97 USPQ2d 1408 (TTAB 2010) (finding an otherwise “thin consent” to be viable and reversing a §2(d) refusal, in view of the relationship of the parties, the provisions of a licensing agreement executed by the parties, and the fact that the goods and services offered under both parties’ marks were manufactured and sold by applicant).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e9506">If a consent agreement makes representations about both parties’ beliefs regarding the likelihood of confusion and/or indicates that both parties have agreed to undertake certain actions to avoid confusion, then it should be signed by both parties, or by individuals with legal authority to bind the respective parties. In some instances, however, a consent document might be signed only by the registrant, because only the registrant has provided its consent, agreed to take certain actions, or made representations as to the likelihood of confusion. The absence of applicant’s signature on the document in such cases does not necessarily render the document unacceptable, but, like any other consent document, its persuasive value should be determined in light of all other evidence in the record. <i>See, e.g., Donnay Int’l</i>, 31 USPQ2d at 1956-57 (finding that a consent letter signed only by the registrant and consisting merely of registrant’s consent to applicant’s registration and use of the applied-for mark was entitled to limited weight, but nonetheless concluding that it served to “tip the scales” in favor of reversing the §2(d) refusal, especially in view of the minimal evidence supporting the conclusion that confusion was likely); <i>In re Palm Beach Inc.</i>, 225 USPQ 785, 787-88 (TTAB 1985) (concluding there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion as to applicant’s and registrant’s marks, based on, <i>inter alia</i>, the different nature of the parties’ goods, two consent letters signed only by owners of the cited registration, and an affidavit of an officer of applicant’s subsidiary indicating that actual confusion had not occurred during the more than 45 years of the marks’ coexistence and that future likelihood of confusion was believed to be unlikely).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-7d105e9509">In the <i>In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.</i> decision, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals stated as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-1d105e9517">[W]hen those most familiar with use in the marketplace and most interested in precluding confusion enter agreements designed to avoid it, the scales of evidence are clearly tilted. It is at least difficult to maintain a subjective view that confusion will occur when those directly concerned say it won’t. A mere
<i> assumption</i> that confusion is likely will rarely prevail against uncontroverted evidence from those on the firing line that it is not.
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b211_31706">476 F.2d at 1363, 177 USPQ at 568.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-10d105e9532">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has indicated that consent agreements should be given great weight, and that the USPTO should not substitute its judgment concerning likelihood of confusion for the judgment of the real parties in interest without good reason, that is, unless the other relevant factors clearly dictate a finding of likelihood of confusion. <i>See In re Four Seasons Hotels Ltd.</i>, 987 F.2d 1565, 26 USPQ2d 1071 (Fed. Cir. 1993);
<i> In re N.A.D. Inc.</i>, 754 F.2d 996, 224 USPQ 969 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <i>see also du Pont</i>, 476 F.2d at 1362-63, 177 USPQ at 568; <i>cf. In re Mastic Inc.</i>, 829 F.2d 1114, 4 USPQ2d 1292 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (affirming TTAB’s holding that applicant’s mark was barred by §2(d), because the provided consent to register was essentially a “naked” consent and all other relevant factors weighed in favor of a conclusion that confusion was likely).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-12d105e9550">Thus, examining attorneys should give substantial weight to a proper consent agreement. When an applicant and registrant have entered into a credible consent agreement and, <i>on balance</i>, the other factors do not dictate a finding of likelihood of confusion, an examining attorney should not interpose his or her own judgment that confusion is likely.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-13d105e9559">A consent agreement is not the same as a “concurrent use” agreement. The term “concurrent use” is a term of art that refers to a geographical restriction on the registration. See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e6468">TMEP §1207.04</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9580">According to <i>In re E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.</i>, the “fame of the prior mark” is a factor to be considered in determining likelihood of confusion. 476 F.2d 1357, 1361, 177 USPQ 563, 567 (C.C.P.A. 1973). Because, in ex parte proceedings, the examining attorney is not expected to submit evidence regarding the fame of the cited mark, this factor is usually treated as neutral in such proceedings. However, this factor is usually considered more significant in inter partes proceedings. <i>See</i>
<i>Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations, LLC v. Fed. Corp.</i>, 673 F.3d 1330, 102 USPQ2d 1061 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <i>Recot, Inc. v. M.C. Becton</i>, 214 F.3d 1322, 54 USPQ2d 1894 (Fed.

</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b211_31c50">Famous marks are afforded a broad scope of legal protection because they are more likely to be remembered and associated in the public mind than a weaker mark. <i>Palm Bay Imps., Inc. v. Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Maison Fondee en 1772</i>, 396 F.3d 1369, 1374, 73 USPQ2d 1689, 1694 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <i>Bose Corp. v. QSC Audio Prods. Inc.</i>, 293 F.3d 1367, 1371-76, 63 USPQ2d 1303, 1305-09 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (finding opposer’s marks, ACOUSTIC WAVE and WAVE, to be famous and thus entitled to broad protection); <i>Recot</i>, 214 F.3d at 1327, 54 USPQ2d at 1897 (finding Board erred in limiting the weight accorded to the fame of opposer’s FRITO-LAY mark); <i>Kenner Parker Toys Inc. v. Rose Art Indus., Inc.</i>, 963 F.2d 350, 353, 22 USPQ2d 1453, 1456 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (finding Board erred in discounting the significance of the fame of opposer’s mark PLAY-DOH); <i>UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Mattel, Inc.</i>, 100 USPQ2d 1868, 1883 (TTAB 2011) (finding MOTOWN very famous in connection with musical recordings and musical entertainment, and noting that “a famous mark such as Motown can be expected to cast a long shadow and to be used in connection with numerous collateral goods”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-7d105e9615">When present, the fame of a mark is “a dominant factor in the likelihood of confusion analysis . . . independent of the consideration of the relatedness of the goods.” <i>Recot</i> , 214 F.3d at 1328, 54 USPQ2d at 1898; <i>L’Oreal S.A. v. Marcon</i>, 102 USPQ2d 1434, 1438 (TTAB 2012) (noting that “a finding that a mark enjoys significant fame expands the scope of protection which might be accorded a lesser-known mark” and that “the fame of a registered or previously used mark can never support a junior party”); <i>Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC v. Ruben</i>, 78 USPQ2d 1741, 1750 (TTAB 2006) (“As the fame of a mark increases, the degree of similarity between the marks necessary to support a conclusion of likely confusion declines.”); <i>see also</i>
<i>Nike, Inc. v. Maher</i>, 100 USPQ2d 1018, 1023 (TTAB 2011) (finding applicant’s mark JUST JESU IT, and opposer’s mark JUST DO IT similar for likelihood of confusion purposes “despite the potential differences in meaning, given the fame of opposer’s mark and the similarity of appearance, pronunciation and overall commercial impressions”). 
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b211_31ea8">However, like the other <i>du Pont</i> factors, the fame of a mark may be considered only if there is relevant evidence of record. <i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e5044">TMEP §1207.01</a>
 . Thus, a party who asserts that its mark is famous must submit evidence clearly establishing that its mark is viewed by relevant purchasers as a famous mark. <i>See, e.g., In re Hard Rock Cafe Licensing Corp. v. Elsea</i>, 48 USPQ2d 1400, 1409 (TTAB 1998). The fame of a mark may be shown by evidence of, <i>inter alia</i>, the quantity of sales of products bearing the mark, the amount of advertising expenditures relating to the mark, and the length of time such indications of commercial awareness have been evident. <i>See Bose</i>, 293 F.3d at 1371, 63 USPQ2d at 1305-06.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-8d105e9632">Because of the nature of the evidence required to establish the fame of a registered mark, the Board normally does not expect the examining attorney to submit evidence as to the fame of the cited mark in an ex parte proceeding. <i>See In re Thomas</i>, 79 USPQ2d 1021, 1027 n.11 (TTAB 2006). And, in an ex parte analysis of the <i>du Pont</i> factors for determining likelihood of confusion (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e5044">TMEP §1207.01</a>), the “fame of the mark” factor is normally treated as neutral when no evidence as to fame has been provided. <i>See id.; see also In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd.</i>, 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1204 (TTAB 2009) (noting that the absence of evidence as to the fame of the registered mark “is not particularly significant in the context of an ex parte proceeding”).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9687">During the examination of an application, the examining attorney should consider separately each registration found in a search of the marks registered in the USPTO that may bar registration of the applicant’s mark under §2(d). If the examining attorney finds registrations that appear to be owned by more than one registrant, he or she should consider the extent to which dilution may indicate that there is no likelihood of confusion. However, the examining attorney must cite all the marks that are considered to be a bar to registration of the mark presented in the application, even if they are owned by different parties. The examining attorney should always explain the reason that the mark in each cited registration is grounds for refusal under §2(d).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9699">A family of marks is defined as “a group of marks having a recognizable common characteristic, wherein the marks are composed and used in such a way that the public associates not only the individual marks, but the common characteristic of the family, with the trademark owner.” <i>J &amp; J Snack Foods Corp. v. McDonald’s Corp.</i>, 932 F.2d 1460, 1462, 18 USPQ2d 1889, 1891 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The common element may be a term, a phrase, or a component in the nature of a prefix or suffix.
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b211_3228a">The family of marks doctrine may be invoked by a plaintiff in inter partes proceedings relating to likelihood of confusion, but is not available to a defendant as a defense against an opposer’s or applicant’s intervening rights. <i>Baroid Drilling Fluids Inc. v. Sun Drilling Prods.</i>, 24 USPQ2d 1048 (TTAB), amended by 1992 TTAB LEXIS 27 (TTAB 1992).
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b211_322e4">Moreover, a family of marks argument is not available to an applicant seeking to overcome a likelihood of confusion refusal in an ex parte proceeding; instead, the focus of the likelihood of confusion analysis must be on the mark applicant seeks to register, not other marks applicant may have used or registered. <i>In re Cynosure, Inc.</i>, 90 USPQ2d 1644, 1645 (TTAB 2009); <i>see also In re Ald, Inc.</i>, 148 USPQ 520, 521 (TTAB 1965) (“[I]n view of the specific prohibition of Section 2(d) . . ., the fact that applicant may possess a ‘family’ of marks characterized by the term ‘ALD’ is of no particular significance herein if the mark for which applicant now seeks registration . . . is confusingly similar to the previously registered mark . . . .”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e9714">It has also been noted that, in ex parte proceedings, examining attorneys do not have access to the evidence and information needed to establish whether a family of marks exists. <i>In re Mobay Chem.

<p id="ch1200_d1b211_32453">When determining if a likelihood of confusion exists between marks used in connection with pharmaceuticals or medicinal products for human use, greater care must be taken to avoid confusion because mistakes in the selection and use of these goods may result in serious and harmful consequences. <i>See Clifton v. Plough, Inc.</i>, 341 F.2d 934, 934, 144 USPQ 599, 600 (C.C.P.A. 1965); <i>In re Cook Med. Tech. LLC</i>, 105 USPQ2d 1377, 1381-82 (TTAB 2012); <i>Schering Corp. v.

Thus, in cases where confusion involving pharmaceuticals or medicinal products could result in harm or other serious consequences to consumers, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and its primary reviewing court have considered this an additional relevant factor and applied a stricter standard that may require a lesser degree of proof to establish likelihood of confusion. <i>See Glenwood Labs., Inc. v.

<li class="nobull">(2) The owner of the registration consents to the grant of a concurrent use registration to the applicant; or
</li>
<li class="nobull">(3) The applicant’s date of first use in commerce is before the <i>filing date</i> of the pending applications or of any registrations issued under the Trademark Act of 1946. When a party specified as an excepted user does not own an application or registration, the applicant’s date of first use in commerce is before the filing date of any application to register the mark that may be filed by the excepted user.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-3d105e9935">An application for registration as a lawful concurrent user is generally examined in the same manner as any other application for registration. 37 C.F.R. §2.99(a). The examining attorney must examine the application to determine whether it complies with the relevant requirements for a non-restricted application. Additionally, the applicant must comply with the following requirements in a concurrent use application:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull">(1) The applicant must specify the goods and the geographic area for which the applicant seeks registration of the mark. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(3)(D); 37 C.F.R. §2.42. The applicant must also set forth the mode of use. 37 C.F.R. §2.42.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(2) The applicant must specify, to the extent of its knowledge, the exceptions to its claim of exclusive use, listing any concurrent use by others and the relevant goods, geographic areas, and periods of this use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(3)(D); 37 C.F.R. §2.42.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(3) The applicant must also list the names and addresses of the concurrent users, the registrations issued to or applications filed by them (if any), and the mode of such use. 37 C.F.R. §2.42.
</li>
<li class="nobull">(4) The verification for a concurrent use application should be modified to indicate an exception, that no one else
<i> except as specified in the application</i> has the right to use the mark. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. §1051(a)(3)(D); 

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e555">TMEP §804.02</a>
.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-5d105e9979">The applicant does not have to insert the stated exceptions in the verification or declaration; the exceptions may be set forth anywhere in the application.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-6d105e9982">In addition to the requirements noted above, which apply to all applications for concurrent use registration, concurrent use applications must meet other conditions, depending on whether the application is subject to a concurrent use proceeding before the Board (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e6576">TMEP §§1207.04(e)-(e)(i)</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1200-4d105e10017">Ordinarily, the examining attorney should not require an applicant for concurrent use registration to submit evidence in support of its claim to concurrent rights. However, the examining attorney should refuse registration under §2(d) if the applicant has requested a concurrent use registration and information in the record suggests that the applicant has not met the basic requirements for concurrent use registration (e.g., if the application indicates that the applicant adopted and used the mark with knowledge of the superior rights of a person specified as an excepted user, or that actual confusion has resulted from the concurrent use of the marks of the parties in their respective geographic areas). <i>See</i>
<i>Gray v. Daffy Dan’s Bargaintown</i>, 823 F.2d 522, 526-27, 3 USPQ2d 1306, 1308-09 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <i>Am. Best Franchising Inc. v.

<p id="ch1200_d1b211_3407a">If an application that seeks registration through a concurrent use proceeding before the Board complies with the relevant requirements and it appears that the applicant is otherwise entitled to registration but for the question of concurrent rights, the examining attorney will approve the application for publication subject to a concurrent use proceeding. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. §1062(a). The examining attorney must not issue a refusal under §2(d) as to any registration named by the applicant as an exception to its exclusive rights.
</p>
<p id="ch1200_d1b211_3409c">If, in response to a refusal under §2(d) or an advisory regarding an earlier-filed application, an application is amended to seek registration through a concurrent use proceeding and complies with the relevant requirements, and it appears that the applicant is otherwise entitled to registration but for the question of concurrent rights, the examining attorney will withdraw the previously issued refusal or advisory as to any registration or application named by the applicant as an exception to its exclusive rights and will approve the application for publication subject to a concurrent use proceeding.
