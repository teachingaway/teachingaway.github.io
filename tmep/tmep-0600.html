Recognition under this paragraph shall continue only during the period that the conditions specified in this paragraph obtain.

No application for recognition to practice before the USPTO is necessary. The USPTO does not give an examination for eligibility or maintain a register of United States attorneys entitled to practice in trademark cases. An attorney meeting the requirements of 37 C.F.R. §11.14 who files a power of attorney pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §2.17(c), appears in person, or signs a document on behalf of an applicant or registrant will be accepted as the representative of the applicant or registrant. 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b). A qualified practitioner may also be recognized as the applicant’s representative if the practitioner is identified as the attorney of record in the application, even when the application is signed by the applicant. A telephone call from an attorney does not satisfy the “appearance” requirements of 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-4d75e237">Only individuals, not law firms, are entitled to be recognized to represent an applicant or registrant. Generally, attorneys who have not specifically been mentioned in a power of attorney may discuss but not conclude business with the USPTO over the telephone. However, if an attorney from the same United States firm as the attorney of record claims to be authorized by the attorney of record to conduct business and approve amendments with respect to a specific application or registration, the USPTO will permit the attorney to conclude business, and will note this fact in any resulting examiner’s amendment, priority action, or Office action. <i>See</i> 37 C.F.R. §2.18(a)(7).

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-6d75e729">
<i>Post Registration.</i> For purposes of recognition as a representative by the Post Registration Section of the Office, the USPTO considers a power of attorney filed in connection with an affidavit under 15 U.S.C. §1058, §1062(c), §1065, or §1141k (“affidavit under §8, §12(c), §15, or §71”), a renewal application under 15 U.S.C. §1059 (“§9 renewal application”), or a request for amendment or correction under 15 U.S.C. §1057 (“§7 request”) to end upon acceptance or final rejection of the filing. 37 C.F.R. §2.17(g)(2). Due to the length of time that may elapse between the filing of these documents (which could be 10 years or more), the USPTO will recognize a qualified practitioner who transmits one of these documents even absent a new power of attorney or revocation of a previous power.
</p>
<div id="" class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-1d75e735">
<i>Example 1:</i> A qualified practitioner (Attorney A) transmits an affidavit under §8, and the USPTO issues an Office action in connection with the affidavit.

<p id="TMEP-ch-600-11d75e760">
<i>Change of Ownership.</i> For purposes of recognition as a representative, the USPTO considers a power of attorney filed in connection with an application or registration to end when ownership changes. 37 C.F.R. §2.17(g). After a change in ownership has been recorded, if a new qualified practitioner appears on behalf of the new owner, the USPTO will communicate and conduct business with that practitioner even absent a new power of attorney or revocation of the previous power. If the previously recognized practitioner appears on behalf of the new owner (which might occur when the new owner is a related company), the USPTO will continue to conduct business and correspond with that practitioner. The previously recognized practitioner does not have to file a new power of attorney signed by the new owner. See <a href="tmep-0600.html#TMEP-600d1e1373">TMEP §609.02(f)</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-600-12d75e766">
<i>Effect on Attorney and Correspondence Information in USPTO Records.</i> In the situations discussed above, when the USPTO deems a power of attorney to end for purposes of recognition as a representative, the USPTO will not automatically change the attorney and correspondence address in its Trademark database, because it is possible that the previously recognized practitioner still represents the applicant or registrant and wants to continue receiving correspondence. The USPTO will continue to recognize the previously recognized practitioner if he or she appears or signs a document on behalf of the applicant or registrant. However, if a new qualified practitioner appears in person or signs a document, the Office will recognize the new qualified practitioner pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b), and correspond with him or her, without requiring a new power of attorney or revocation of the previous power.

<p id="TMEP-ch-600-6d75e821">For purposes of recognition as a representative of an applicant or registrant, the USPTO considers a power of attorney filed while an application is pending to end with respect to a particular application when the mark is registered, when the application is abandoned, or when ownership changes. 37 C.F.R. §2.17(g)(1). The USPTO considers a power of attorney filed after registration to end when the registration is cancelled or expired or when ownership changes. 37 C.F.R. §2.17(g)(2).

<i>37 C.F.R. §2.17(c)   Requirements for power of attorney.</i>
</h4>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-3d75e859"> A power of attorney must:</p>
<ul >
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d12e991" class="nobull">(1) Designate by name at least one practitioner meeting the requirements of §11.14 of this chapter; and
</li>
<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d12e998" class="nobull">(2) Be signed by the individual applicant, registrant, or party to a proceeding pending before the Office, or by someone with legal authority to bind the applicant, registrant, or party (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership). In the case of joint applicants or joint registrants, all must sign. Once the applicant, registrant, or party has designated a practitioner(s) qualified to practice under §11.14 of this chapter, that practitioner may sign an associate power of attorney appointing another qualified practitioner(s) as an additional person(s) authorized to represent the applicant, registrant, or party. If the applicant, registrant, or party revokes the original power of attorney (§2.19(a)), the revocation discharges any associate power signed by the practitioner whose power has been revoked. If the practitioner who signed an associate power withdraws (§2.19(b)), the withdrawal discharges any associate power signed by the withdrawing practitioner upon acceptance of the request for withdrawal by the Office.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-5d75e879">A power of attorney must: (1) designate by name at least one individual qualified practitioner; and (2) be signed by the individual applicant or registrant or someone with legal authority to bind a juristic applicant or registrant (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership). In the case of joint applicants or registrants, all must sign. 37 C.F.R. §§2.17(c), 2.193(e)(3). See <a href="tmep-0600.html#TMEP-600d1e1619">TMEP §611.01(c)</a>
 regarding signature of documents transmitted electronically.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-6d75e885">If a power specifies only the name of a law firm, the USPTO will treat it as a correspondence address rather than a power of attorney. See <a href="tmep-0600.html#TMEP-600d1e1073">TMEP §§609–609.04</a>
 regarding the correspondence address.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-7d75e892">A qualified practitioner cannot sign an original power of attorney on behalf of his or her client. An original power of attorney, other than one associating an additional attorney with an already recognized attorney (See <a href="tmep-0600.html#TMEP-600d1e742">TMEP §605.03</a>), must be signed by the individual applicant or registrant or someone with legal authority to bind a juristic applicant or registrant (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-8d75e898">However, the filing of a power of attorney is not mandatory in a trademark case. Thus, if a power of attorney is signed by an improper person (e.g., by the named attorney) and no other qualified practitioner has been previously appointed, the USPTO generally will not require a properly signed power. If the improperly signed power of attorney is accompanied by a document that is signed by a qualified practitioner or includes the name and address of a qualified practitioner, the USPTO may recognize that qualified practitioner under 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b), separate and apart from the improperly signed power. See <a href="tmep-0600.html#TMEP-600d1e423">TMEP §604.01</a>
 regarding the three ways that a qualified practitioner may be recognized as a representative,

<a href="tmep-0600.html#TMEP-600d1e1225">TMEP §609.02(a)</a>
 regarding the limited situations in which the USPTO will change the correspondence address to that of a qualified practitioner absent a written request to change the correspondence address.
</p>
<div id="" class="Example">
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-1d75e912">
<i>Example:</i> If the original application contains the name and address of a qualified practitioner (e.g., the “Attorney” section of a TEAS application contains the name and address of an attorney from a United States firm or a Canadian attorney or agent who has been recognized by the OED Director), and the application includes a power of attorney signed by the named practitioner, the USPTO will disregard the improperly signed power. However, the USPTO will recognize and correspond with the named qualified practitioner, pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §2.17(b).
</p>
</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-10d75e916">However, if an applicant or registrant is already represented by a qualified practitioner, and a new qualified practitioner wishes to take action with respect to the application or registration, the new qualified practitioner must file a new power of attorney or revocation of the previous power, signed by the individual applicant or registrant or someone with legal authority to bind a juristic applicant or registrant (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership), before the USPTO will accept filings by or correspond with the new qualified practitioner. 37 C.F.R. §2.18(a)(7). See <a href="tmep-0600.html#TMEP-600d1e605">TMEP §604.03</a>
 regarding change of attorney, and

 regarding revocation of power of attorney.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-11d75e925">If two or more qualified practitioners are named in a power of attorney and one practitioner changes firms, any of the named practitioners can sign and submit a notice of change of correspondence address setting forth a new address, even if the new address is at a new firm. It is not necessary to submit a new power signed by the applicant or registrant when a named practitioner changes firms. See <a href="tmep-0600.html#TMEP-600d1e1193">TMEP §§609.02–609.02(f)</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-600-17d75e1270">For paper filings, if the practitioner who seeks to withdraw is also the domestic representative, the managing attorney or supervisor should inquire as to whether the practitioner intends to withdraw as domestic representative. This inquiry should be made by telephone or e-mail, if possible. If the practitioner withdraws as domestic representative, the managing attorney or supervisor must ensure that the “Domestic Representative” field in the USPTO’s Trademark database is updated.

<i>Requests Filed After Registration.</i> For purposes of recognition as a representative, the USPTO considers a power of attorney to end with registration. 37 C.F.R. §2.17(g)(1). If the power is filed in connection with an affidavit under §8, §12(c), §15, or §71, a §9 renewal application, or a §7 request, the power is deemed to end upon acceptance or final rejection of the filing. 37 C.F.R. §2.17(g)(2).

<p id="TMEP-ch-600-3d75e1729">The USPTO will construe the following as a written request to change the correspondence address:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull">(1)  If a qualified practitioner transmits documents on behalf of an applicant or registrant who is not already represented by another qualified practitioner from a different firm, the USPTO will construe this as including a request to change the correspondence address to that of the practitioner (however, the filing of an “associate power of attorney” or similar document does not change the correspondence address); or
</li>
<li class="nobull">(2) If an applicant or registrant files a properly signed power of attorney (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0600.html#TMEP-600d1e652">TMEP §605.01</a>) designating a qualified practitioner, the USPTO will change the correspondence address to that of the practitioner named in the power, even if the applicant or registrant does not file a separate request to change the address.

</ul>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-5d75e1749">37 C.F.R. §§2.18(b)(3) and (4). In these two situations, the USPTO will change the correspondence address to the address of the new qualified practitioner. In all other situations, a written request to change the correspondence address, signed by the individual applicant or registrant, someone with legal authority to bind a juristic applicant or registrant (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership), or the qualified practitioner of record, is required. 37 C.F.R. §§2.18(b)(2) and 2.193(e)(9)–2.193(e)(9)(ii).

<p id="TMEP-ch-600-3d75e1766">A request to change the correspondence address must be in writing. 37 C.F.R. §2.18(b)(2). Once the USPTO recognizes a qualified practitioner as the representative of an applicant or registrant, only that practitioner or another qualified practitioner from the same United States firm may sign a request to change the address, unless the applicant or registrant files a revocation of the previous power and/or a new power of attorney, or the previously recognized practitioner files a request to withdraw. 37 C.F.R. §§2.193(e)(3), 2.193(e)(9)(i), and 11.18(a).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-4d75e1772">If the applicant or registrant is not represented by a qualified practitioner, the request must be signed by the individual applicant or registrant or someone with legal authority to bind a juristic applicant or registrant (e.g., a corporate officer or general partner of a partnership). In the case of joint applicants or registrants, all must sign.

<p id="TMEP-ch-600-3d75e1806">Once the correspondence address is established for a particular application, the USPTO will generally not change it unless there is a written request to do so, signed by the applicant or the qualified practitioner of record. 37 C.F.R. §§2.18(a)(7) and (b)(2). The mere transmittal of a response to an Office action bearing a new address for an applicant or an applicant’s qualified practitioner does not effect a change in a correspondence address. See <a href="tmep-0600.html#TMEP-600d1e1251">TMEP §609.02(b)</a>

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-4d75e1815">When the request is filed through TEAS, the data from the form is inputted directly into the USPTO's Trademark database. When a request to change the correspondence address is filed <i>on paper</i>, the USPTO manually enters the new correspondence address into its Trademark database and places the request in the application record, but does not send a confirmation or other acknowledgment of the request to change the correspondence address. The applicant may check the TSDR database at 

<a href="http://tarr.uspto.gov/" target="_blank">http://tsdr.uspto.gov</a>
 to determine whether the change of address has been entered into the USPTO’s Trademark database.

The USPTO will update its Trademark database to indicate the name of the qualified practitioner who filed the affidavit, renewal application, or §7 request, and update the correspondence address to that of the qualified practitioner. 37 C.F.R. §§2.17(g)(2) and 2.18(c)–2.18(c)(2). If the registrant is not represented by a qualified practitioner, the USPTO will update its Trademark database to indicate the registrant’s address as shown in the affidavit, renewal application, or §7 request as the correspondence address of record.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-5d75e1907">If the new owner does not file a separate written request with the Trademark Operation to change the correspondence address, but instead takes an action in connection with an application or registration by filing a properly signed communication (e.g., a response to an Office action or statement of use) bearing a new correspondence address, the USPTO may update its Trademark database to reflect the address of the new owner or the new owner’s qualified practitioner even if the new owner does not specifically request a change of the correspondence address.

<li id="TMEP-ListItem-d12e2766" class="nobull">(1) The filer enters any combination of letters, numbers, spaces, and/or punctuation marks that the filer has adopted as a signature, placed between two forward slash (“/”) symbols. 37 C.F.R. §2.193(c). Examples of acceptable signatures include /

<ul >
<li class="nobull"> Person identifies him/herself as an officer of a pro se applicant or registrant (e.g., “President,” “Vice President,” “Treasurer,” “Secretary”) of a domestic corporation or the equivalent for another type of business entity (e.g., “Partner” for a partnership, “Member” or “Principal” for a Limited Liability Company).
</li>
<li class="nobull"> Person signing for a previously pro se applicant or registrant identifies him/herself as an attorney in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any state in the United States who is practicing abroad (e.g., Mary Smith, member of New York State Bar, with offices in Nassau, Bahamas).

<li class="nobull"> Person signing for a foreign corporation identifies him/herself as “general counsel” or “in-house counsel” 
<b id="">AND a “corporate officer” or another corporate officer position (e.g., “Secretary,” “Treasurer,” or “Vice President”).

<i>Potentially Unauthorized Parties.</i> In the following situations, a signatory is presumed to be unauthorized to represent an applicant or registrant:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull"> Person signing provides no title or position (e.g., applicant is Jack Smith, an individual citizen of the United States, and Mary Jones signs the response; or applicant is ABC Corporation, and Bill Miller, President, signs the original application, but Dave Wilson, with no listed title or position, signs the response).
</li>
<li class="nobull"> Person signing appears to be a foreign attorney (e.g., “solicitor” or “barrister” for a foreign entity), or is a foreign law consultant with a law firm in the United States.
</li>
<li class="nobull"> Person signing identifies him/herself as a non-attorney representing applicant or registrant in some other capacity (e.g., accountant, paralegal, trademark administrator, business manager, personal assistant, or legal secretary).
</li>
<li class="nobull"> Person signing provides the address of a foreign firm.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-4d75e2977">A proper reply to a notice of incomplete response should state the nature of the relationship of the signer to the applicant or registrant. If the signer has legal authority to bind the applicant or registrant, the person should so state, and should set forth his or her title or position. If the signer is an attorney who may practice before the USPTO pursuant to 37 C.F.R. §11.14(a), the attorney should identify himself or herself as an attorney and indicate the bar of the U.S. state of which he or she is a member in good standing. If the signer meets the requirements of either 37 C.F.R. §§11.14(b) or (c), the person should explain how he or she meets these requirements. For example, a Canadian attorney or agent recognized to practice before the USPTO in trademark cases by OED (<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0600.html#TMEP-600d1e228">TMEP §602.03(a)</a>) may simply state he or she has received recognition by OED as a Canadian practitioner under §§11.14(c) and (f).

<p id="TMEP-ch-600-3d75e3075">Where a document must be signed by someone with legal authority to bind a corporation, a corporate officer must sign. An officer is a person who holds an office established in the articles of incorporation or corporate bylaws.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-4d75e3078">The usual titles for officers are President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer. In some organizations, the Treasurer is called a Comptroller or Controller, and these terms are acceptable. In Maine and Massachusetts the term “Clerk” identifies an officer of a corporation.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-5d75e3081">Modifications of these basic titles are acceptable if they include the officer title. Titles such as Vice-President for Sales, Executive Vice-President, Assistant Treasurer, Executive Secretary, and Administrative Secretary are acceptable.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-6d75e3085">The signature of the “Chairman” or “Chairman of the Board of Directors” is also acceptable, but not the signature of an individual director (e.g., the Vice-Chairman of the Board). The terms “Executive Secretary” and “Administrative Secretary” are acceptable because they include the officer-title “Secretary.”
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-7d75e3088">Some titles are generally <i>not</i> accepted because they usually do not identify officers. For instance, a General Manager, or any other type of manager, is usually merely an employee, not an officer.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-8d75e3091">If the applicant or registrant states that the person who signed the response is authorized to bind the applicant or registrant under the articles of incorporation or bylaws, the USPTO will accept the signature.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-9d75e3094">A corporation cannot delegate authority to sign to someone who is not a corporate officer. 
<i>In re Textron, Inc.</i>, 183 USPQ 301 (Comm'r Pats. 1974). Therefore, documents purporting to authorize representation, even if signed by officers, will not be accepted as establishing authority of a person who does not have authority to legally bind the corporation under its bylaws or articles of incorporation.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-10d75e3097">When the applicant or registrant is a corporation, a statement that the signatory is an “officer” or “duly authorized officer” of the corporation is acceptable.

<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-600d1e2121">611.06(e)  Signature by Foreign Companies and Corporations</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-3d75e3109">There are significant differences between the legal entities established under the laws of the United States and legal entities established and recognized under the laws of foreign countries, and the titles and duties of officers of foreign corporations and companies often differ from those in the United States. In the case of foreign entities that are in the nature of corporations, the USPTO will accept the signature of a person considered to be equivalent to an officer under the law of the foreign country. Indication of a title identifying the signer as a type of officer – such as “Legal Officer” or “Information Officer” – is also sufficient.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-4d75e3112">In foreign countries, a person who holds the title “Manager” or “Director” is normally an officer or the equivalent of an officer.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-5d75e3115">The term “Procurist” is used in a number of countries to indicate an officer. For British companies, the terms “Registrar” and “Confidential Clerk” are the equivalent of officers.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-6d75e3119">If the applicant or registrant states that the person who signed the response holds a position that is the equivalent of an officer of a United States corporation, the USPTO will accept the signature.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-7d75e3122">Simply stating that a person has been granted authority to act on behalf of the applicant or registrant is insufficient. Documents purporting to authorize representation, even if signed by officers, will not be accepted as establishing the authority of a person who is not the equivalent of an officer. The applicant or registrant must state that the signatory has authority to legally bind the applicant or registrant under its bylaws or articles of incorporation.
</p>
</div>
<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-600d1e2135">611.06(f)  Signature by Unincorporated Association</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-3d75e3134">For organizations that are less formally organized than corporations (e.g., fraternal societies, unions, unincorporated associations, and governmental bodies), the titles for officers are less standardized. These organizations frequently use more individualistic terms for titles than the terms customarily used by corporations, and the officer positions themselves may not be as clearly or as formally provided for as is the case with corporations. Regardless of how unfamiliar the title is or how informal the position seems to be, the USPTO will accept the signature if the applicant or registrant states on the record that the signer has, within the framework of the particular organization, authority equivalent to that of an officer to act on behalf of the organization (i.e., has authority to legally bind the applicant or registrant under its bylaws or articles of formation). Some titles that have been accepted are Director, National Director, National Commander, Permanent Chairman, International Sponsor, Supreme Ruler, Royal Impresario, and Chairman of the Steering Committee.

<p id="TMEP-ch-600-3d75e3146">A limited liability company (“LLC”) has attributes of both a corporation and a partnership. 
<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e333">TMEP §803.03(h)</a>
. Laws vary to some extent as to the authority conferred on various individuals associated with the limited liability company. Generally, a “manager” has authority equivalent to an officer in a corporation. Therefore, anyone identified as a manager, or equivalent, may sign. In addition, anyone with a corporate-officer-type title may sign. In some states, the members, who are the owners, also have authority to act on behalf of the limited liability company.

<i>See</i> <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e383">TMEP §803.03(k)</a>
. Laws vary to some extent as to the authority conferred on various partners associated with the limited liability partnership. Generally, all partners are recognized as having general agency authority to bind the partnership in the ordinary course of business. Therefore, anyone identified as a partner may sign.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-600-4d75e3167">Many states provide for the filing of a Statement of Partnership Authority which specifically names partners having authority and/or limits the authority of certain individuals. If an individual who is not a named partner of the LLP has been recognized as having authority to bind the LLP, that person may sign, and must indicate his or her position as an individual designated in the LLP’s Statement of Partnership Authority.
