<h1 class="page-title">1101  Bona Fide Intention To Use the Mark In Commerce</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-3d100e18">Section 1(b) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051(b), provides that an applicant may file an application based on a bona fide intention to use a mark in commerce “under circumstances showing the good faith of such person.”
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-4d100e21">A verified statement of the applicant’s bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce must be included in intent-to-use (“ITU”) applications under §1(b), and in applications under §§44 and 66(a). 15 U.S.C. §§1051(b)(3)(B), 1126(d)(2), 1126(e), and 1141f(a). See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e555">TMEP §§804.02</a>
 and 

<a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e437">1008</a>
 regarding the requirements for a verified statement in §§1(b) and 44 applications, and

<a href="tmep-1900.html#TMEP-1900d1e1007">§1904.01(c)</a>
 regarding the requirement for a declaration of the applicant’s bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce in a §66(a) application.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-5d100e27">If the verification is not filed with the initial application, the verified statement must also allege that the applicant has had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce since the filing date of the application. 37 C.F.R. §§2.34(a)(2), 2.34(a)(3)(i) and 2.34(a)(4)(ii). See <a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e450">TMEP §§804–804.05</a>
 regarding verifications.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-6d100e34">A verified statement of the applicant’s continued bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce must also be included in a request for an extension of time to file a statement of use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(d)(2); 37 C.F.R. §§2.89(a)(3), (b)(3); 

<a href="tmep-1100.html#TMEP-1100d1e661">TMEP §§1108.02</a>
 and 

<a href="tmep-1100.html#TMEP-1100d1e726">1108.02(e)</a>
.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-7d100e43">Reasonable variations in the wording of the statement may be acceptable. For example, the applicant may state that it has “a bona fide intention to use in commerce the mark on or in connection with . . .,” or may use the words “good faith” instead of “bona fide.” 
<i>In re B.E.L.-Tronics Ltd</i>., 24 USPQ2d 1397, 1400 (Comm’r Pats. 1992). However, the wording “in commerce” is required and cannot be varied. 
<i>In re Custom Techs Inc</i>., 24 USPQ2d 1712 (Comm’r Pats. 1991); <i>In re B.E.L.-Tronics</i>, 24 USPQ2d at 1400

<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-8d100e46">See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e353">TMEP §1201.03(a)</a>
 regarding an assertion by an intent-to-use applicant of a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce through a related company.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-9d100e52">See <a href="tmep-1000.html#TMEP-1000d1e437">TMEP §1008</a>
 regarding the requirement for an allegation of a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce in an application filed under §44 of the Trademark Act.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-10d100e58">The USPTO will <i>not</i> evaluate the good faith of an applicant in the ex parte examination of applications. Generally, the applicant’s sworn statement of a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce will be sufficient evidence of good faith in the ex parte context. Consideration of issues related to good faith may arise in an inter partes proceeding, but the USPTO will not make an inquiry in an ex parte proceeding unless evidence of record clearly indicates that the applicant does not have a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce.

<h1 class="page-title">1102  Initial Examination of Intent-to-Use Applications</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-3d100e70">In an intent-to-use application, the examining attorney will potentially examine the application twice: first, when it is initially filed based on a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce under 15 U.S.C. §1051(b), and second, when the applicant files an allegation of use (i.e., either an amendment to allege use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(c) or a statement of use under 15 U.S.C. §1051(d)). See <a href="tmep-1100.html#TMEP-1100d1e94">TMEP §§1104–1104.11</a>
 regarding amendments to allege use, and 

<a href="tmep-1100.html#TMEP-1100d1e826">TMEP §§1109–1109.18</a>
 regarding statements of use. After receipt of the application, the examining attorney will initially examine the application to determine whether the mark is eligible for registration but for the lack of evidence of use. If the mark is determined to be eligible, the mark will be approved for publication and then published for opposition. If the applicant has not submitted an amendment to allege use before approval for publication, and the application is not successfully opposed, the USPTO will issue a notice of allowance. 15 U.S.C. §1063(b)(2); 37 C.F.R. §2.81(b). See <a href="tmep-1100.html#TMEP-1100d1e512">TMEP §§1106–1106.04</a>
 regarding notice of allowance. In such a case, the applicant must submit a statement of use. 15 U.S.C. §1051(d)(1); 37 C.F.R. §2.88.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-4d100e82">An intent-to-use application is subject to the same requirements and examination procedures as other applications, except as specifically noted. The examining attorney must raise all possible refusals and requirements in initial examination.
</p>
<div class="Section">
<h1 class="page-title" id="TMEP-1100d1e35">1102.01  Substantive Refusals</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-3d100e93">To the fullest extent possible, the examining attorney will examine an intent-to-use application for registrability under Trademark Act §§1, 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d), and 2(e), 15 U.S.C. §§1051 and 1052(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e), according to the same procedures and standards that apply to any other application. That is, the examining attorney must make all appropriate refusals and/or requirements with respect to issues such as ownership, deceptiveness, likelihood of confusion, mere descriptiveness, geographic significance, and surname significance. 
<i>In re Bacardi &amp; Co. Ltd</i>., 48 USPQ2d 1031, 1035 (TTAB 1997); <i>In re Am. Psychological Ass’n</i>, 39 USPQ2d 1467, 1469 (Comm’r Pats. 1996).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-4d100e96">The examining attorney should not issue a requirement or refusal under these sections during examination of the statement of use if the issue could or should have been raised during initial examination, unless the failure to issue the refusal or requirement would be a clear error. 
<i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e566">TMEP §§706.01</a>
, 

<a href="tmep-1100.html#TMEP-1100d1e957">1109.08</a>
.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-5d100e105">Where a significant length of time has elapsed since the initial examination, a mark may have become descriptive or even generic as applied to the goods/services. In such a case, since the evidence of the descriptive or generic use would not have been available during initial examination, the requirement or refusal must be issued during second examination. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-6d100e109">The examining attorney should investigate all possible issues regarding registrability through all available sources. If appropriate, the examining attorney may require that the applicant provide literature or an explanation concerning the intended manner of use of the mark, or the meaning of the mark in relation to the goods/services, under 37 C.F.R. §2.61(b). 
<i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e2611">TMEP §814;</a>

<i>In re DTI P'ship LLP</i>, 67 USPQ2d 1699, 1701 (TTAB 2003); <i>In re Page</i>, 51 USPQ2d 1660, 1665 (TTAB 1999).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-7d100e115">The examining attorney should also search applicant’s website to see if it provides information about the goods/services. 
<i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-0700.html#TMEP-700d1e1280">TMEP §710.01(b);</a>

<i>In re Promo Ink</i>, 78 USPQ2d 1301, 1303 (TTAB 2006) (rejecting applicant’s argument that it was improper for the examining attorney to rely on evidence obtained from applicant’s website when the application was based on intent to use and no specimens were yet required, and stating that “[t]he fact that applicant has filed an intent-to-use application does not limit the examining attorney’s evidentiary options, nor does it shield an applicant from producing evidence that it may have in its possession.”).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-8d100e121">While the examining attorney must examine and act on all possible issues in the initial examination of the application, requirements or refusals specifically tied to use of the mark (e.g., ornamentation) should generally be addressed after the applicant submits an allegation of use <i>and</i> a specimen showing use of the mark in commerce. See <a href="tmep-1200.html#TMEP-1200d1e718">TMEP §§1202–1202.17(e)(vi)</a>
 regarding use as a mark. However, an examining attorney may review a §1(b) application for which no allegation of use and specimen have been submitted, and believe it likely that a refusal of registration on the ground that the subject matter does not function as a mark may be made after an allegation of use is submitted. In that instance, this potential refusal should be brought to the applicant’s attention in the first action issued by the USPTO. This is done strictly as a courtesy. If information regarding this possible ground for refusal is not provided to the applicant before the allegation of use is filed, the USPTO is not precluded from later refusing registration on this basis.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-3d100e505">Under 37 C.F.R. §2.76(a), an applicant may not file an amendment to allege use pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §1051(c) after the date that the application is approved for publication by the examining attorney. Under 37 C.F.R. §2.88(a), an applicant may not file a statement of use pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §1051(d) before the date of issuance of the notice of allowance. These two rules combine to create a period of time when neither an amendment to allege use nor a statement of use may be filed. This period is known as the “blackout period.” Any statement of use or amendment to allege use filed during this period will be deemed untimely and the fee refunded.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-4d100e665">The examining attorney must not cancel an approval of or withdraw an application from publication to process an untimely amendment to allege use.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-5d100e668">The USPTO will not retain an untimely amendment to allege use and process it as a statement of use. However, the applicant may resubmit an untimely amendment to allege use as a statement of use after the notice of allowance issues.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-4d100e690">The examining attorney will contact the applicant or the applicant’s attorney by telephone or e-mail, and give the applicant the opportunity to withdraw the amendment to allege use.

<i>Amendment to Allege Use Withdrawn</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-6d100e697">If the applicant withdraws the amendment to allege use, the examining attorney should advise applicant that a notice of allowance will issue if the application is not successfully opposed, and that the applicant must file a statement of use, or request for an extension of time to file a statement of use, within six months after the issuance of the notice of allowance. The examining attorney should advise applicant that, instead of filing a statement of use, the applicant may file a written request that the USPTO treat the amendment to allege use as a statement of use. Such a request <i>must be filed within six months 
<b id="">after the issuance of the notice of allowance</i>, and should be faxed to the ITU/Divisional Unit at (571) 273-9550. The examining attorney should enter a Note to the File in the record reflecting the substance of the communication with the applicant. The filing date of the statement of use will be the date of receipt of the applicant’s written request to treat the amendment to allege use as a statement of use.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-7d100e700">The applicant has the option of receiving a refund of the filing fee for the amendment to allege use, or applying the fee toward the statement of use. If the applicant requests a refund, the examining attorney should ask an LIE to arrange for the refund.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-8d100e703">Because §1(d)(1) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1051(d)(1), explicitly requires that a statement of use be filed within six months <i>after</i> the issuance date of the notice of allowance, the USPTO cannot process the amendment to allege use as a statement of use unless the applicant files a written request within six months after the issuance date of the notice of allowance. If the applicant does not file a statement of use, a request for an extension of time to file a statement of use, or a written request to treat the amendment to allege use as a statement of use within six months after the issuance of the notice of allowance, the application will be abandoned, even if the amendment to allege use is still in the record and the filing fee for the amendment to allege use has not been refunded.

The examining attorney should enter an appropriate Note to the File in the record, and then examine the amendment to allege use. If the amendment to allege use can be approved, and does not raise any issues that require the examining attorney to issue an Office action requiring a response, the examining attorney should approve the amendment to allege use. The mark must then be republished.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-11d100e715">If examination of the amendment to allege use raises issues that would require the examining attorney to issue requirements or refusals in an Office action, the examining attorney should request jurisdiction for the purpose of issuing the relevant requirements or refusals. 
<i>See</i>

<a href="tmep-1500.html#TMEP-1500d1e330">TMEP §1504.04(a)</a>

The examining attorney should follow the procedures explained above, except that no request for jurisdiction is necessary. Once the amendment to allege use is ultimately approved or withdrawn, the application should be referred back to the Board for appropriate action.

. If the amendment to allege use was filed before the application was assigned to the examining attorney, the Office action must address all refusals or requirements related to both the application and the amendment to allege use. If the amendment to allege use is referred to an examining attorney after issuance of an Office action, the examining attorney must accept it, if appropriate, and issue a supplemental Office action that supersedes any outstanding action, incorporates all outstanding refusals and/or requirements, and provides a new six-month response period.
</p>
<p id="ch1100_d1d849_24a08_fc">Generally, the Office action must be nonfinal, because the issues arising from examination of the amendment to allege use would be raised for the first time. In rare cases, an issue arising from examination of the amendment to allege use will already have been raised. For example, if the examining attorney issued a final refusal of registration in a §1(a) application because the specimen failed to show use of the mark in commerce or failed to demonstrate use as a mark, the applicant may amend the application to seek registration under §1(b). If the applicant subsequently submits an amendment to allege use that includes the same specimen (or a different specimen that is deficient for the same reason), no new issue is raised because the requirement to submit a specimen showing acceptable use of the mark in commerce has already been raised. <i>Cf</i>. <i>In re GTE Educ. Servs.</i>, 34 USPQ2d 1478, 1480 (Comm'r Pats. 1994) (holding that examining attorney properly determined that no new issue had been raised in request for reconsideration of final refusal based on inadequate specimens, where the substitute specimens submitted with the request were deficient for the same reason as the original specimens).
</p>
<p id="ch1100_d1d849_24ac4_1bf">If the application is suspended at the time the amendment to allege use is referred for examination, the examining attorney must accept and review it. If no further action on the amendment to allege use is required because all statutory requirements are satisfied, the application must be resuspended. If the amendment to allege use does not meet all statutory requirements, the examining attorney must remove the application from suspension and issue a nonfinal Office action that maintains and continues any requirements and refusals that were operative at the time of the suspension.
</p>
<p id="ch1100_d1d849_24ae5_261">If the amendment to allege use is referred for examination at the same time as a response to an outstanding Office action, or when a response is awaiting review, the examining attorney must accept it and review both the response and the amendment to allege use. If the amendment to allege use does not meet all statutory requirements, the examining attorney must issue a new nonfinal Office action that includes all refusals and/or requirements related to the amendment to allege use and maintains and continues all refusals and/or requirements not overcome or satisfied by the response. If the amendment to allege use meets all statutory requirements, the examining attorney must issue a final refusal regarding all refusals and/or requirements not overcome or satisfied by the response, or approve the mark for publication if all refusals and/or requirements have been overcome or satisfied.

These sections do not exhaust all possible grounds for issuing a refusal or making a requirement. Moreover, any amendments filed with an amendment to allege use that do not pertain to use of the proposed mark (e.g., changes to the identification of goods/services or drawing), must be separately considered and examined according to standard examination procedures.

<p id="ch1100_d1d849_24da4_65">The examining attorney must confirm that the proper party has filed the amendment to allege use. Only the applicant or a valid assignee under §10 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1060, may file an amendment to allege use. If USPTO records show title in a party other than the party filing the amendment to allege use, the examining attorney must refuse registration on the ground that the amendment to allege was not filed by the owner of record. <i>See</i> 37 C.F.R. §2.76(b)(1)(i). In such cases, the examining attorney must withhold acceptance of the amendment to allege use until the party who filed the amendment to allege use establishes ownership. If the party filing the amendment to allege use was not the owner of the mark at the time of filing, the true owner may file a substitute amendment to allege use (including the filing fee for each class) on or before the date the application is approved for publication.
</p>
<p id="ch1100_d1d849_24ed7_2f0">If the party filing the amendment to allege use was the owner at the time of filing, the party may submit evidence to establish chain of title within the response period specified in the Office action. <i>See</i> 37 C.F.R. §§3.71(d), 3.73(b). To establish ownership, the party who filed the amendment to allege use must either: (1) record an assignment or other document of title with the Assignment Recordation Branch, and include a statement in the response to the Office action that the document has been recorded; or (2) submit other evidence of ownership, in the form of a document transferring ownership from one party to another or an explanation, in the form of an affidavit or declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20, that a valid transfer of legal title has occurred. 37 C.F.R. §3.73(b)(1).

The applicant may delete, limit, or clarify the goods/services, but may not add to or expand the identification. 37 C.F.R. §2.71(a). The amendment to allege use must specify <i>all</i> the goods/services for which the applicant seeks registration under §1(a), by listing or incorporating by reference the goods/services on or in connection with which the mark is in use in commerce. <i>See</i> 37 C.F.R. §2.76(b)(1)(ii). To incorporate the goods/services by reference, the applicant may state that the mark is in use on “those goods/services identified in the application” or “those goods/services identified in the application except . . . [followed by an identification of the goods/services to be deleted].”
</p>
<p id="ch1100_d1d849_254b2_cc">If goods/services identified in the application are omitted from the amendment to allege use and it is not accompanied by a request to divide, the omitted goods/services must be deleted from the application and the amendment to allege use accepted. However, if an amendment to allege use is submitted for only some of the goods/services and the applicant specifies an intention to retain the goods/services not yet in use, the amendment to allege may not be accepted until a request to divide the goods/services that are not in use is filed. <i>See</i> 37 C.F.R. §2.76(c);

</p>
<p id="ch1100_d1d849_2556c_1fd">If the amendment to allege use includes an amended identification of goods/services, to determine whether the amended identification is acceptable and within the scope of the previous identification, the amended identification must be examined in relation to the last acceptable identification of record. 

<a href="tmep-1400.html#TMEP-1400d1e1982">TMEP §§1402.07(d), (e)</a>
. When the amended goods/services exceed the scope of a previous acceptable identification, the amended goods/services must be refused. If both an amendment to allege use and a response to an outstanding Office action are received and the two filings contain different amendments to the identification of goods/services, this creates an ambiguity that must be clarified by the applicant.
</p>
<p id="ch1100_d1d849_2568c_399">If the applicant lists <i>all</i> the goods/services identified in the application in the section of a pre-printed amendment to allege use paper form designated for the identification of goods/services that are not in use (the effect of which is a representation that the mark was not used in connection with any goods/services), then the applicant has not expressed an intention to delete these goods/services, and the examining attorney must inquire as to the discrepancy.

The applicant may amend the dates of use if the applicant supports the amendment with an affidavit or declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20. 37 C.F.R. §2.71(c). The applicant may not amend the dates of use to recite dates of use that are subsequent to the filing of the amendment to allege use. However, the applicant may withdraw the amendment to allege use. 37 C.F.R. §2.76(h).
</p>
<p id="ch1100_d1d849_2580a_58">The requirement for a verified statement that “the mark is in use in commerce” is a minimum filing requirement that must be satisfied before the amendment to allege use may be examined on the merits. 37 C.F.R. §2.76(e)(3).

The notice of allowance in an intent-to-use application will issue about eight weeks after the date the mark was published. The USPTO does not publish any notification in the <i>Official Gazette</i> that a notice of allowance has been issued.

Therefore, the examining attorney does not have to request jurisdiction to take an action, as would be required after publication but before the notice of allowance issues. 
<i>See id</i>. However, after a notice of allowance issues, the examining attorney should not make a refusal or requirement that could or should have been made during initial examination of the application unless the initial failure to make the refusal or requirement was a clear error. If the examining attorney determines that he or she must make a refusal or requirement after issuance of the notice of allowance that could or should have been made during initial examination, the examining attorney must consult with his/her managing attorney or senior attorney before taking the action. This must be done whether the action is to be taken before, during, or after examination of the statement of use, and regardless of whether the notice of allowance is cancelled. This applies to any refusal that arguably could or should have been made during initial examination, such as most refusals under §2(d) or §2(e)(1) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-5d100e1245">Neither the Trademark Act nor the Trademark Rules of Practice restrict the USPTO from issuing a new requirement or new refusal at any time prior to registration.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-3d100e1299">When the applicant receives a notice of allowance, the applicant should check the accuracy of the information. If there are any errors in the notice of allowance, the applicant should notify the ITU/Divisional Unit of the USPTO immediately, preferably by fax or telephone. Telephone and fax numbers may be found on the USPTO website at

<i>Correction of USPTO Error</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-5d100e1308">If an error in the notice of allowance was the result of a USPTO error (e.g., entering data incorrectly or failing to enter a timely filed amendment), the USPTO will determine whether the change requires republication. If necessary, the ITU staff will contact the examining attorney by e-mail to approve the change and determine whether republication is required.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-6d100e1312">If the change may be made without republication, the ITU staff will make the correction and issue a corrected notice of allowance. 
<i>The USPTO will not issue a new notice of allowance or extend the time for filing a statement of use</i>.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-7d100e1315">If republication is required, and no action by the examining attorney that requires a response is necessary, the ITU staff will make the correction, cancel the notice of allowance, and refund any fees paid for filing a statement of use or request(s) for extension of time to file a statement of use. The application will then be scheduled for republication. If the application is not successfully opposed, the USPTO will issue a new notice of allowance.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-8d100e1318">If the examining attorney must issue an Office action that requires a response as a result of the requested correction, the ITU staff will cancel the notice of allowance, refund any fees paid for filing a statement of use or request(s) for extension of time to file a statement of use, and forward the application to the examining attorney for further action.

<i>Correction of Applicant’s Error</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-10d100e1324">If an error in the notice of allowance is the result of an applicant’s error (e.g., providing incorrect information in the application or in an amendment to the application), the applicant must file a written amendment, which will be processed like any other amendment filed after issuance of the notice of allowance and before filing of the statement of use.

<h1 class="page-title">1107  Amendment After Issuance of the Notice of Allowance and Before Filing of the Statement of Use</h1>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-3d100e1339">Generally, the only amendments that may be entered in an application between the issuance of the notice of allowance and the submission of a statement of use are: (1) the deletion of specified goods/services from the identification of goods/services; (2) the deletion of a basis in a multiple-basis application; and (3) changes of attorney and changes of address. 
<i>See</i> 37 C.F.R. §2.77(a). The “deletion of specified goods/services,” within the meaning of 37 C.F.R. §2.77, means the elimination of an existing item in an identification of goods/services in its entirety. Deletion is distinct from other types of amendments to limit an identification, such as amendments to limit the goods/services as to types, channels of trade or classes of purchasers, or to restrict an existing item in scope by the introduction of some qualifying language, or the substitution of specific terms for more general terms.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-4d100e1342">The USPTO will normally not consider any other amendment to the application during this period. If the applicant submits any other amendment during this period, the USPTO will place the amendment in the record for consideration at the time of examination of the statement of use. 37 C.F.R. §2.77(b). The ITU staff will advise the applicant in writing that the amendment has been received but that it will not be considered until the examining attorney examines the statement of use unless the applicant files a petition to the Director. The ITU staff will enter a Note to the File in the record directing the examining attorney’s attention to the amendment.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-5d100e1345">The applicant may file a petition under 37 C.F.R. §§2.146(a)(3) and (a)(5) to waive 37 C.F.R. §2.77 to permit an examining attorney to examine an amendment (other than an amendment deleting a basis or deleting specified goods/services) during the period between the issuance of the notice of allowance and the filing of the statement of use.

</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-1d100e1382">
<i>Amendment Acceptable; Republication Not Required</i>: If an examining attorney determines that an amendment is acceptable and republication is not required, the examining attorney will call or e-mail the applicant to notify the applicant of the acceptance, and enter a Note to the File in the record indicating that the proposed amendment has been accepted and that the applicant has been notified of the acceptance. The examining attorney will instruct the LIE to enter the amendment. The application will await the filing of a statement of use or extension request.
</p>
<p id="ch1100_d1ff0c_231d7_1d8">
<i>Amendment Acceptable; Republication Required</i>: If an examining attorney determines that the amendment is acceptable but republication is required, the examining attorney will notify the applicant by telephone or e-mail that the amendment cannot be accepted at this time because republication is required, and that the amendment may be resubmitted when the statement of use is filed. The examining attorney must also enter a Note to the File that the applicant has been so notified. The USPTO cannot republish the application after issuance of the notice of allowance and prior to submission of the statement of use and will not cancel the notice of allowance to allow republication unless there was USPTO error, since this could substantially delay prosecution of the application. The applicant may resubmit the amendment with the statement of use so that republication can occur.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-5d100e1386">
<i>Amendment Unacceptable</i>: If an examining attorney determines that an amendment is unacceptable, the examining attorney will call or e-mail the applicant to notify the applicant that the amendment is not accepted, and enter a Note to the File in the record indicating that the proposed amendment is unacceptable and that the applicant has been so notified. The application will await filing of a statement of use or extension request. The applicant must accept the refusal to enter the amendment, but may again request to amend the application when filing the statement of use.  
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-7d100e1393">
<i>Examiner’s Amendment Required; Republication Not Required</i>: If an examining attorney determines that an examiner’s amendment is necessary, and republication is not required, the examining attorney will prepare, but not send, the examiner’s amendment. The examiner’s amendment must contain a statement that republication is not required. The examining attorney must e-mail the internal TMPHOTOCOMP mailbox, with the unsent examiner’s amendment attached, along with instructions for entering the requested amendment. The body of the e-mail message must include a statement that republication is not required. The Office of Trademark Program Control will enter and mail the examiner’s amendment.

If the mark is not in use in commerce before the expiration of the six-month period following the issuance of the notice of allowance, the applicant must file a request for an extension of time to file a statement of use within the six-month period to avoid abandonment of the application. See 15 U.S.C. §1051(d)(4).
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-4d100e1424">The first six-month extension may be requested without a showing of good cause. Up to four additional six-month extensions may be requested; each must include a showing of good cause. 
<i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. §1051(d)(2). Thus, the total time available for filing the statement of use may not be extended beyond thirty-six months from the issuance date of the notice of allowance. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. §1051(d).

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1100-4d100e1454">Extensions of time are granted in six-month increments. 37 C.F.R. §2.89(c). Only one extension request may be filed in each six-month extension period that has been granted. The first extension request must be filed within six months of the date the notice of allowance issued. The second and subsequent extension requests must be filed before the expiration of the previously granted extension period. The total time available for filing the statement of use may not be extended beyond thirty-six months from the issuance date of the notice of allowance. 15 U.S.C. §§1051(d)(1)–1051(d)(2); 37 C.F.R. §2.89(e)(1).

When an extension request is filed electronically, TEAS almost immediately displays a “Success” page that confirms receipt. This page is evidence of filing should any question arise as to the filing date of the extension request, and it may be printed or copied-and-pasted into an electronic record for storage.

The application will be forwarded to the examining attorney to issue an Office action in the new (child) application requiring the new owner to pay the required fees. See <a href="tmep-1100.html#TMEP-1100d1e1260">TMEP §1110.02</a>
 regarding the amount of the fee(s) for a request to divide. If the owner of the child application fails to respond, the child application will be abandoned. The USPTO will not approve the child application for publication or registration until the new owner pays the required divisional fees. It is not necessary for the new owner to file a separate request to divide.
