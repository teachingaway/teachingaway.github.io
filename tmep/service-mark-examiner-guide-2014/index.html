The US Trademark Office has adjusted its rules for acceptable "specimens of use" in trademark applications. The "specimen of use" is the applicant's evidence that she is actually using the claimed trademark to sell some product or service. The rules are particularly tricky for service mark applications for technology products - software as a service, apps, APIs, etc. This is the Trademark Office's August 2014 guide for filing specimens of use.

<P >This examination guide reviews the requirements for service-mark specimens; discusses issues that frequently arise and explains the relevant potential refusals; addresses the common types of specimens submitted in connection with
modern technology-related services; and provides examples. While the
guide focuses on service marks for computer technology services in
terms of discussion and examples, the stated specimen examination
principles generally apply to all service-mark specimens.</P>

<H1 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__18_117078490"></A>I. Background</H1>

<H2 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__20_117078490"></A>Purpose
of Service Marks and Requirement for a Specimen</H2>

<P >A service mark
identifies and distinguishes the services of one party from those of
another and indicates their source.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote1anc" HREF="#sdendnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP>
 To obtain registration of a service mark under Section 1 of the
Trademark Act, an applicant must submit a specimen showing the mark
as used in commerce.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote2anc" HREF="#sdendnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>
 Under Section 45, a mark is deemed to be in “use in commerce” on
services “when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising
of services.”<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote3anc" HREF="#sdendnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<H2 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__22_117078490"></A>Types of Service-Mark Specimens</H2>

<P >“[B]ecause by its very nature a service mark can be used in a wide variety of ways, the types of specimens which may be submitted as evidence of use are
varied.”<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote4anc" HREF="#sdendnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>
 Whatever type of specimen is submitted, it must show proper use in
commerce, which may be established by (1) showing the mark used or
displayed as a service mark in the <I>sale</I> of the services,<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote5anc" HREF="#sdendnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>
which includes use in the course of rendering or performing the
services;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote6anc" HREF="#sdendnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A></SUP>
or (2) showing the mark used or displayed in <I>advertising</I> the
services,<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote7anc" HREF="#sdendnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A></SUP>
which encompasses marketing and promotional materials.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote8anc" HREF="#sdendnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A></SUP>
 For purposes of clarity and simplicity, this examination guide uses
the term “rendering” when discussing specimens that show use of
the mark in the sale, performance, or rendering of the services.</P>

<P >The type of specimen
submitted will often be apparent without the need for additional
information regarding how the mark is used on the specimen. A
specimen description submitted by the applicant typically helps
clarify the manner in which the mark is used in commerce, and the
more explanation the applicant provides initially, the more helpful
it is to the examining attorney’s analysis. Thus, applicants are
encouraged to provide a specimen description and explain how the
applicant renders or provides the services and, if relevant, how
marks are commonly used in the particular industry for such services.
 For instance, a description stating that a specimen comprises a
title screen bearing the mark and showing the mark used in rendering
the identified services is helpful when examining the nature and
acceptability of the specimen.</P>

<P >If it is not readily
apparent that the specimen meets the criteria for an advertisement or
rendering type of specimen, and any specimen description does not
clarify the issue, the specimen must be refused for failing to show
the mark in use in commerce.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote9anc" HREF="#sdendnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A></SUP>
 See Part III regarding the grounds for refusal. If clarification
regarding the nature of the specimen or the manner in which the mark
is used may easily overcome the refusal (e.g., the applicant explains
that the specimen is a title screen displaying the mark at the start
of the provision of the identified services), an advisory to that
effect may be included with the refusal.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote10anc" HREF="#sdendnote10sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H2 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__24_117078490"></A>Other
Specimen Considerations and Issues</H2>
<P >Regardless of whether
the submitted specimen shows the mark used in advertising or
rendering the services, the examining attorney should consider the
following when determining whether a service-mark specimen is
acceptable.</P>

<P ><I>Whether the Specimen
Shows the Mark as Actually Used by the Applicant in Commerce in the
Sale or Advertising of the Services</I>: The specimen must show the
mark as actually used by the applicant in selling or advertising the
services.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote11anc" HREF="#sdendnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A></SUP>
 Therefore, materials such as news articles and mock-ups of
advertisements are not acceptable because they do not demonstrate the
required use of the mark by the applicant.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote12anc" HREF="#sdendnote12sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A></SUP>
 In some instances, a specimen or the specimen description may
indicate that the specimen is not yet in use in commerce by inclusion
of wording such as “internal only,” “printer’s proof,”
“website coming soon,” or “under construction.”</P>

<P ><I>Whether the
Identified Services Are Registrable Services</I>: A service-mark
specimen must show the mark used or displayed in connection with a
registrable service offered for the benefit of others. For
information regarding activities that constitute registrable
services, see TMEP §§1301.01–1301.01(b)(v).</P>

<P ><I>Whether the Specimen
Shows Use in Connection with All Classes in a Multiple-class
Application</I>: The same specimen may be acceptable for multiple
classes if the specimen shows direct association between the mark and
at least one of the identified services in each class. <I>See </I>Part
II. B below. If the applicant intends for a submitted specimen to
support multiple classes, the applicant should include a statement to
that effect and indicate the classes supported by the specimen,<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote13anc" HREF="#sdendnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A></SUP>
but the applicant need not submit multiple copies of the same
specimen.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote14anc" HREF="#sdendnote14sym"><SUP>14</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<P ><I>Whether the
Applied-for Mark Is Used in Connection With the Identified Services</I>:
 The specimen must demonstrate the applied-for mark serving as a
source indicator for the identified services. Therefore,
registration must be refused if the specimen shows the mark is used
only to promote goods rather than the identified services, or the
mark is used as a service mark but not for the identified services
(I. e., the applicant misidentified the services).<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote15anc" HREF="#sdendnote15sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A></SUP>
 See Part III. A regarding failure to show use in commerce and Part
IV. A regarding misidentified services.</P>

<P ><I>Whether the
Applied-for Mark Functions as a Service Mark</I>: The applied-for
mark must actually function as a source-indicating service mark. 
Thus, registration must be refused if, for example, the specimen
shows the mark serves <I>solely</I> as a trade name, <I>only</I> as
the name of a computer software program or application, <I>exclusively</I>
as the name of a method, process, or system, or <I>merely</I> as
informational or ornamental matter.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote16anc" HREF="#sdendnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A></SUP>
 That the software or process may actually be used in providing the
identified services neither transforms that software or process into
the identified services, nor associates the name of that software or
process as the name of the identified services.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote17anc" HREF="#sdendnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A></SUP>
 However, the specimen may be acceptable if it <I>also</I> shows that
the mark serves as a service mark for the identified services.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote18anc" HREF="#sdendnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A></SUP>
 See Part III. B regarding failure to function as a service mark. The
use of the “SM” symbol with the mark does not, by itself,
transform a designation into a service mark if other indicia suggest
that it does not function as a service mark.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote19anc" HREF="#sdendnote19sym"><SUP>19</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H1 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__26_117078490"></A>II. Elements
of an Acceptable Service-Mark Specimen</H1>
<P >To be acceptable, a
service-mark specimen must show the mark sought to be registered used
in a manner that demonstrates direct association between the mark and
the services. Essentially, the mark must be shown “in a manner
that would be perceived by potential purchasers as identifying the
applicant's services and indicating their source.”<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote20anc" HREF="#sdendnote20sym"><SUP>20</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<P >The acceptability of a
specimen is determined based on the facts and evidence of record, and
viewed in the context of the relevant commercial environment.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote21anc" HREF="#sdendnote21sym"><SUP>21</SUP></A></SUP>
 Thus, the information provided by the specimen itself, any
explanations offered by the applicant clarifying the nature, content,
or context of use of the specimen, and any other information in the
record should be considered in the analysis.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote22anc" HREF="#sdendnote22sym"><SUP>22</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<P >When the identified
services involve newer technology, the examining attorney must follow
the appropriate examination policies and procedures, but also should
employ a practical approach in analyzing the submitted specimen.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote23anc" HREF="#sdendnote23sym"><SUP>23</SUP></A></SUP>
 This may entail reviewing all the information of record to
understand both how the mark is used and how it will be perceived by
consumers.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote24anc" HREF="#sdendnote24sym"><SUP>24</SUP></A></SUP>
 Additionally, if the examining attorney elects to conduct research
regarding the mark, the services, or practices in the particular
industry, it may be helpful to consider any information uncovered
regarding how the applicant and others in the industry typically
advertise and render the identified services in the relevant
marketplace, as well as the manner in which service marks are
normally used in connection with those services. See Section IV
below for a discussion of issues surrounding technology-related
services.</P>
<H2 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__28_117078490"></A>Show the
Mark</H2>
<P >The mark on the drawing
must be a substantially exact representation of the mark shown on the
specimen.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote25anc" HREF="#sdendnote25sym"><SUP>25</SUP></A></SUP>
 Furthermore, the designation must appear sufficiently prominent on
the specimen (e.g., placement, size, or stylization) so that it will
be perceived by consumers as a mark.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote26anc" HREF="#sdendnote26sym"><SUP>26</SUP></A></SUP>
 For instance, if shown in the same font, size, and color as the
surrounding text on the specimen, the designation may not be
perceived as a source indicator.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote27anc" HREF="#sdendnote27sym"><SUP>27</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H2 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__30_117078490"></A>Associate
the Mark with the Identified Services</H2>
<P >The specimen must show
the mark used in a manner that creates in the minds of potential
consumers <I>direct association</I> between the mark and the
services.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote28anc" HREF="#sdendnote28sym"><SUP>28</SUP></A></SUP>
 Direct association is the minimum the specimen must show,<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote29anc" HREF="#sdendnote29sym"><SUP>29</SUP></A></SUP>
and it may be established textually, contextually, or logically. 
What is necessary to establish direct association differs depending
on the type of specimen submitted; I. e., whether it is an advertising
specimen or a rendering specimen.</P>

<P ><I>Mark Used in
Advertising</I>: For specimens showing the mark used in <I>advertising</I>
the identified services, the specimen must explicitly reference the
services to establish the requisite direct association.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote30anc" HREF="#sdendnote30sym"><SUP>30</SUP></A></SUP>
 While the services need not be stated word for word, a “sufficient
reference”<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote31anc" HREF="#sdendnote31sym"><SUP>31</SUP></A></SUP>
to the services themselves or a general reference to the trade,
industry, or field of use is required (e.g., use of the word “design”
is a sufficient reference to “commercial art design” services).<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote32anc" HREF="#sdendnote32sym"><SUP>32</SUP></A></SUP>
 However, if the alleged reference to the services is so vague that
the services cannot be discerned, the specimen will not be
acceptable.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote33anc" HREF="#sdendnote33sym"><SUP>33</SUP></A></SUP>
 See <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex23">Example
20</A></U></FONT> (I0BIT).</P>

<P ><I>Mark Used in
Rendering</I>: For specimens showing the mark used in <I>rendering</I>
the identified services, the services need not be explicitly
referenced to establish the requisite direct association.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote34anc" HREF="#sdendnote34sym"><SUP>34</SUP></A></SUP>
 Rather, direct association may be indicated by the context or
environment in which the services are rendered, or may be inferred
based on the consumer’s general knowledge of how certain services
are provided or from the consumer’s prior experience in receiving
the services.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote35anc" HREF="#sdendnote35sym"><SUP>35</SUP></A></SUP>
 In other words, the context in which the services are provided and
consumer knowledge and experience create an inference of the services
without an explicit <I>textual</I> reference to the services. See
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex16">Example 17</A></U></FONT>
(CASHFLOW UNITS).</P>

<P >The applicant may
respond to a specimen refusal for failing to show direct association
by explaining the nature of the <I>mark’s</I> use or the manner in
which the <I>services</I> are advertised or rendered.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote36anc" HREF="#sdendnote36sym"><SUP>36</SUP></A></SUP>
 With respect to a particular industry’s typical use of marks in
relation to specific services, it may also be helpful for the
applicant to provide an explanation regarding industry practice
concerning the use of the mark during the rendering of such services
and how the applicant’s use comports with such practice. See
><U><A HREF="#Ex21">Example 19</A></U> (design of speech bubbles).</P>

<P >The mere fact that the
mark is displayed and the services are explicitly referenced or can
be inferred from the context of the specimen does not automatically
result in direct association between them.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote37anc" HREF="#sdendnote37sym"><SUP>37</SUP></A></SUP>
 The specimen must associate the mark with the services such that the
mark serves as a source identifier for those particular services.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote38anc" HREF="#sdendnote38sym"><SUP>38</SUP></A></SUP>
 See <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex16">Example
17</A></U></FONT> (CASHFLOW UNITS) and <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex20">Example
18</A></U></FONT> (RIDE 411).</P>

<P >Thus, a specimen is
unacceptable if it fails to convey a “proper nexus” between the
mark and the services, or if the services are “too attenuated from
the proposed mark,”<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote39anc" HREF="#sdendnote39sym"><SUP>39</SUP></A></SUP>
either in terms of proximity or logical connection. The mere fact
that wording from the identification of services appears somewhere on
the specimen may not necessarily suffice for the mark-services
association or nexus, if there is nothing else to connect that
wording to the mark, such as proximity or additional text that
establishes the connection.</P>

<P >When examining for the
mark-services association, the examining attorney should consider the
specimen’s content, layout, and overall look and feel, as well as
any description of the specimen and industry practice relating to
service-mark usage in advertising and rendering the services.</P>
<H1 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__32_117078490"></A>III. GROUNDS
FOR REFUSAL</H1>
<H2 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__34_117078490"></A>Failure
to Show the Mark Used in Commerce</H2>
<P >Trademark Act Sections
1 and 45 are the statutory bases for refusing a specimen that does
not meet the requirements of an acceptable service-mark specimen;
such specimen is not acceptable because it does not show the mark in
“use in commerce.” For instance, if the mark does not appear on
the specimen or the specimen shows use of the mark in connection with
goods rather than the identified services, the specimen must be
refused for failure to show service-mark use in commerce in
connection with the identified services.</P>

<P >The applicant’s
response options include submitting an acceptable substitute specimen
or, if appropriate, amending the application to a Section 1(b) filing
basis.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote40anc" HREF="#sdendnote40sym"><SUP>40</SUP></A></SUP>
 In some cases, the applicant may respond by providing clarification
of the nature of the original specimen submitted, or an explanation
of the content of the original specimen, to justify its
acceptability.</P>

<P >The examining attorney
may consider any of the following facts and evidence properly made of
record:</P>

<UL>
 <LI><P >declarations from persons with
 firsthand knowledge of the facts, with a sufficiently detailed
 explanation of how the mark is used in advertising or rendering the
 services or how the services are advertised or rendered;</P>
</UL>

<UL>
 <LI><P >clarification of the specimen of
 record, such as an explanation of the nature, content, or context of
 use of the specimen (this explanation need not be verified with a
 declaration);</P>
</UL>

<UL>
 <LI><P >evidence, such as declarations or
 industry-related periodicals, regarding industry practice with
 respect to how marks and services are promoted in advertising or how
 the services are rendered;</P>
</UL>

<UL>
 <LI><P >additional background materials,
 such as printouts showing information on subsequent webpages from
 the applicant’s website or subsequent screenshots of an electronic
 device on which the services may be accessed, rendered, and
 experienced (this matter generally need not be verified with a
 declaration); and/or</P>
</UL>

<UL>
 <LI><P >responses to any Trademark Rule
 2.61(b) request for information.</P>
</UL>

<P >If the specimen of
record, the specimen description, the applicant’s response and
explanations, and any additional proffered evidence are unpersuasive,
a final refusal must issue, if the application is otherwise in
condition for final.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote41anc" HREF="#sdendnote41sym"><SUP>41</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H2 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__36_117078490"></A>Failure
to Show the Mark Functioning as a Service Mark</H2>
<P >A specimen may show the
mark used as something other than a service mark for the identified
services. For instance, it may show the mark used <I>solely</I> as a
trade name, <I>only</I> as the name of a computer software program or
application, <I>exclusively</I> as the name of a method, process, or
system, or <I>merely</I> as informational or ornamental matter.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote42anc" HREF="#sdendnote42sym"><SUP>42</SUP></A></SUP>
 See <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex24">Example
21</A></U></FONT> (LEADING EDGE TONERS). In such cases, the mark
does not function as a service mark to identify and distinguish the
applicant’s services and indicate their source. Thus, a
failure-to-function refusal should issue under Trademark Act Sections
1, 2, 3, and 45.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote43anc" HREF="#sdendnote43sym"><SUP>43</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H1 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__38_117078490"></A>IV. CONSIDERATIONS
AND COMMON ISSUES WHEN EXAMINING A SPECIMEN FOR TECHNOLOGY-RELATED
SERVICES</H1>
<H2 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__40_117078490"></A>Understanding
the Identified Services</H2>
<P >Proper specimen
analysis requires consideration of the nature of the identified
services. Modern computer and technology-related services present
special challenges because these services, and the terminology used
to describe them, are continually evolving. In addition, any online
activity entails the use of computer software, making it difficult to
differentiate the various services provided online from the
underlying technology used to provide them. As the Board has noted,
“[a]lthough it may well be software that is generating the
[services], in today's commercial context if a customer goes to a
company's website and accesses the company's software to conduct some
type of business, the company may be rendering a service, even though
the service utilizes software.”<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote44anc" HREF="#sdendnote44sym"><SUP>44</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<P >It may be unclear,
based on the submitted specimen, whether the applicant is providing
non-software services in a given field or subject matter (e.g.,
“financial consulting in the field of retirement planning” in
Class 36), or offering computer software or application services
involving that same field or subject matter (e.g., “providing
temporary use of non-downloadable software for retirement planning”
in Class 42), or both. Sometimes, an applicant that is actually
providing non-downloadable software services (e.g., “providing
temporary use of non-downloadable software for medical billing” in
Class 42) misidentifies the services as the underlying function of
the software (e.g., “medical billing” in Class 35). Similarly,
the applicant may be using social networking websites to advertise
non-social networking services (e.g., operating a pet store) and
communicate with customers, leading the applicant to misidentify the
services as “online social networking services.”</P>

<P >Thus, a primary
consideration in these instances is whether the specimen indicates
that the applicant is actually performing the relevant service
activities for others, or, for instance, merely providing software
that allows users of the software to perform those activities
themselves, or only offering an online game that is accessed via a
social networking website. See <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex5">Example
5</A></U></FONT> (ATHENACOORDINATOR), <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex8">Example
7</A></U></FONT> (CLINICANYWHERE), and <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex17">Example
14</A></U></FONT> (OUTERNAUTS).</P>

<P >Furthermore, some
traditional services, and the associated terminology, may require
fresh understanding and broader interpretation in the modern
commercial environment. More and more traditional services are now
offered online and, increasingly, multiple services are seamlessly
integrated, creating difficulty in distinguishing the source of the
services. For instance, television programs that were once provided
only by broadcast television and cable outlets are now also
accessible via streaming services like Netflix<SUP>®</SUP>, Hulu<SUP>®</SUP>,
or YouTube<SUP>®</SUP>. Thus, typical service identification terms
like “broadcasting,” “distribution,” and “transmission”
have taken on new meaning in the modern marketplace. Thinking of
traditional and other services more broadly and being cognizant of
the current marketplace realities will also help the examining
attorney determine whether the specimen properly shows use of the
mark in association with the identified services.</P>
<H2 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__42_117078490"></A>Resources
for Determining the Nature of the Services</H2>
<P >When the nature of the
services is not readily apparent from the information of record, such
as the identification and specimen, the examining attorney may
consult several resources for research and guidance, including: the
notices and notes in the U.S. Acceptable Identification of Goods and
Services Manual (ID Manual); the applicant’s and third-party
websites; telephone or e-mail communication with the applicant or
applicant’s attorney; technology dictionaries, encyclopedias, and
trade and industry publications;<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote45anc" HREF="#sdendnote45sym"><SUP>45</SUP></A></SUP>
and the Office of Trademark Classification Policy &amp; Practice
(I. e., ID/Class). In addition, the Trademark Law Library is
available to assist examining attorneys with research. Finally, the
examining attorney may require the applicant to provide further
information about the services, pursuant to Trademark Rule 2.61(b).<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote46anc" HREF="#sdendnote46sym"><SUP>46</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H2 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__44_117078490"></A>Common
Forms of Specimens for Modern Technology-related Services</H2>
<P >As noted above, an
applicant may submit a specimen that shows the mark as used in
rendering the services. These specimens are often submitted in
connection with modern technology-related services and are discussed
below.</P>

<P >Again, for specimens
showing use of the mark in rendering the services, an explicit,
textual reference to the services or their trade, industry, or field
of use is not necessary, but an indication of the services sufficient
to establish direct association between the mark and the services is
required. The examining attorney must refuse the specimen if neither
the specimen itself nor the description of the specimen provides
sufficient information to decipher the nature of the services,
determine the manner of use, and assess whether the necessary
mark-services association exists. <I>See</I> Part III. A above.</P>
<H3 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__46_117078490"></A>Sign-in
Screens</H3>
<P >Applicants often submit
screenshots of sign-in screens as specimens for online services, such
as non-downloadable software services and
application-service-provider services. Sign-in screens show that the
services are available and the context indicates that they are
accessed by inputting credentials, which is a generally known and
accepted means of accessing many online services.<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote47anc" HREF="#sdendnote47sym"><SUP>47</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<P >Some sign-in screens
may include a reference to the services and effectively function as
an advertisement. See <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex7">Example
6</A></U></FONT> (MYFITAGE). Other sign-in screens may contain no
reference to the services, but may nonetheless be acceptable if the
overall content of the specimen sufficiently indicates the services. 
Or, the specimen description may explain the context of the services
by stating the specimen is a sign-in screen for accessing the
services and that applicant is offering the type of services being
applied for. Such an explanation may provide a sufficient basis for
accepting the sign-in screen specimen, as long as there is no
contradictory information in the record indicating that the mark is
not associated with the identified services. See <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex4">Example
4</A></U></FONT> (STAFFTAP).</P>
<H3 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__48_117078490"></A>Title or
Launch Screens 
</H3>
<P >A title or launch
screen is an on-screen graphic that is typically displayed at the
beginning of entertainment content, such as video games or ongoing
television programs, often with other information about the content
featured. For services such as Class 41 entertainment services
involving the provision, production, or distribution of entertainment
content, screenshots of title or launch screens from the content may
create the requisite direct association between the mark and the
services. Thus, title or launch screens may be acceptable specimens
as long as the nature of the specimen is clear either from the
overall look and feel of the specimen or from the applicant’s
description of the specimen.</P>

<P >While showing the title
or launch screen being displayed on any particular electronic device
(e.g., television, computer, or smartphone) is not required, a
specimen showing an electronic device bearing the title or launch
screen may be acceptable without further explanation because it
places the mark in the context of how the services are rendered. See
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Example16">Example
14</A></U></FONT> (OUTERNAUTS). A title or launch-screen specimen
showing only the mark but not the electronic device, with no specimen
description or an insufficient description, may require a specimen
description identifying the specimen as a title or launch screen and
placing the mark in the context of the services. See <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex15">Example
13</A></U></FONT> (DELICIOSO).</P>

<P >While title or
launch-screen specimens may be acceptable to show service-mark use,
the mark must be refused if the specimen shows that the applied-for
mark is the title of a single creative work (e.g., the title or name
of one episode of a television or radio program, one movie, or one
show presented as a single event).<SUP><A CLASS="sdendnoteanc" NAME="sdendnote48anc" HREF="#sdendnote48sym"><SUP>48</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<H3 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__50_117078490"></A>Webpages</H3>
<P >Webpages from an
applicant’s or a third-party’s website are routinely submitted as
<I>advertising</I> and are acceptable if they show the mark used as a
service mark, explicitly/textually reference the identified services,
and associate the mark with those services.</P>

<P >Webpages lacking a
reference to the services may be acceptable if they show use of the
mark in <I>rendering</I> the services. See <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex19">Example
14</A></U></FONT> (OUTERNAUTS).</P>

<P >Webpages from social
networking websites should be scrutinized to ensure that the mark is
properly associated with the identified services. Some applicants
may mistakenly mischaracterize their services as “social
networking” because they assume that advertising or promoting their
non-social networking services via a social networking website means
they are providing social networking services. For instance, an
applicant may mistakenly file an application for “online social
networking services” and provide a Facebook® webpage as a specimen
when, in fact, they operate a pet store and are only using the
Facebook® website to advertise the pet store and communicate
information to and messages with actual and potential customers. 
Such a specimen is not acceptable for the social networking services
since it does not demonstrate that the applicant is providing these
services.</P>
<H3 ><A NAME="__RefHeading__52_117078490"></A>Software
Applications (“Apps”)</H3>
<P >Software applications
(“apps”) for smartphones and computer tablets are now commonly
used to provide online services. Apps are simply the interface that
enables the providers of the services to reach the users and render
the services, and the users to access those services. Common
specimens for such apps are usually screenshots of electronic devices
demonstrating the apps delivering the services. Such a specimen may
not always depict proper service-mark use of the mark in connection
with the identified services, but it may be acceptable if the
displayed screenshot clearly and legibly shows the mark associated
with the identified services as the services are rendered or
performed via the app. See <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="#Ex18">Example
15</A></U></FONT> (KURBKARMA).</P>

<P ><strong>Analysis:</strong> </P>
<UL>
 <LI><P >Specimen is described as
 “screenshot capture of a representative online portal” and
 appears to show the mark used in rendering the services.</P>
 <LI><P >Mark appears prominently in large
 font on a launch screen, on the sign-in screen, and on the top of a
 screen displaying the software services in use.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
 <LI><P >Services are indicated by the
 context in which they are rendered, as follows:</P>
 <UL>
 <LI><P >A launch screen with the wording
 “Version 1.0.27” indicates the version of the online software
 services being rendered.</P>

 <LI><P >A screen showing a date and time
 grid for scheduling tasks and the menu on the left containing
 options, including “Manage My Shifts” and “View Task
 Assignments,” indicates the staff management functions of the
 software services.</P>
 </UL>
 <LI><P >Mark-services association is
 present because the mark appears on the launch screen where it is
 customary in such industry to place the mark under which the
 services are offered and such placement is recognized as the
 introduction of the online services; and the mark also appears on
 the sign-in screen where it is customary to input credentials to
 gain access to online services. The context in which the mark is
 used, I. e., on the title and sign-in screens, creates the
 mark-services connection (since using such screens is common
 practice for rendering such services) and implies that the services
 are available and rendered once the user initiates access to the
 services by logging in. The launch screen alone is acceptable
 because it is generally known that such screens are used to initiate
 the start up of or access to online services. The sign-in screen is
 also acceptable on its own since it is a generally known means of
 accessing online services. The mark is also displayed on another
 screen which shows the mark while the services are being performed
 and, thus, the proximity of the mark to the services conveys a
 connection.</P>

<P ><strong>Analysis:</strong> </P>
<UL>
 <LI><P >Specimen is described as a “photo
 of opening title of applicant's television program” and appears to
 show the mark used in rendering the services.</P>
 <LI><P >Mark is prominently shown in large
 font on the title screen of an electronic device that is displaying
 the ongoing television program.</P>
</UL>
<P >
• Mark-services association is present because the mark appears on
the title screen where it is customary in such industry to place the
mark under which the services are promoted. It is common practice
for a title screen bearing the mark to appear at the start of
entertainment content and indicate the launch of the services. While
the nature of the services is not textually referenced, it is
sufficient that the overall content of the specimen implies that
applicant is offering entertainment services.</P>
<UL>
 <LI><P >The specimen would be unacceptable
 without the specimen description, which clarifies that the specimen
 is an “opening title” and places the mark in the context of
 providing the services. Since the specimen could possibly be print
 advertising, a specimen description is necessary to clarify the
 nature of the specimen. The top right corner of the specimen shows
 some wording that suggests that the title screen is displayed on an
 electronic device. However, since that wording is not legible and
 the context of the title screen is not visible, the nature of the
 specimen is unclear and, thus, a specimen description is required
 clarifying that it is a title screen.</P>

<P >
<strong>Services:</strong> Entertainment services, namely, providing online
video games, in Class 41</P>
<P ><strong>Analysis:</strong> </P>
<UL>
 <LI><P >Specimen is described as a
 “screenshot of the page on Facebook.com, an Internet website, from
 which the services are provided to users” and appears to show the
 mark used in rendering the services.</P>
 <LI><P >Mark is prominently shown in large
 font near the top of the webpage.</P>
 <LI><P >Services are referenced in the
 following statements and indicated by the following:</P>
 <UL>
 <LI><P >The mark appears near video game
 information “Get Star Gems,” “Leaderboard,” and “loading
 Outernauts.”</P>
 <LI><P >The mark appears near the word
 “Games,” generally referencing the services.</P>
 </UL>
 <LI><P >Mark-services association is
 present because it is customary to display service marks near the
 top of the webpage on which the services are advertised or through
 which they are accessed, rendered, and experienced. Here, the mark
 is near indicia implying the services and other marks appear to
 cloud the mark-services connection. While the specimen shows the
 webpage is from a third-party website, I. e., Facebook®, this does
 not diminish the requisite association due to the proximity of the
 applied-for mark to the matter indicating the online services, which
 appear to be directly launched from the website. The screenshot
 also appears to be of the title or launch screen of the online video
 game, where it is common practice in such industry to place the mark
 under which the services are promoted and where such placement is
 recognized as the introduction of the online services. The
 screenshot here implies, and it is generally known, that access to
 and performance of the services begins with this screen. The
 specimen description combined with the wording “loading
 Outernauts” further supports the mark-services connection. The
 specimen is also acceptable as an advertisement since the word
 “Games” appears on the lower left corner as part of a
 third-party mark “Insomniac Games.” It may be inferred that the
 combination of the applied-for mark OUTERNAUTS with the reference to
 “Games” and to “EA” sufficiently and textually references
 the online video game services.</P>
