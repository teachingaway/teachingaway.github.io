                               The applicant may be asked for further clarification for classification of goods of this
                              type during the examination of the application.  If the wording in the identification is
                              broad enough to encompass more than one class, amendment will be required.

                              classified in Class 21, even though the individual components would be classified in other
                              classes).  If the applicant is willing to call its kit a "hobby craft kit" and indicate
                              its purpose (e.g., hobby craft kit for making pot holders), the item can be classified in
                              Class 28 as a kind of toy or amusement product. In addition, although certain types of
                              kits are deemed acceptable for identification and classification purposes without listing
                              the individual components (e.g., face painting kits and teeth whitening kits in Class 3,
                              and first aid kits and ovulation test kits in Class 5), in general, the identification
                              must indicate the type of kit and the principal components.
                           </p>
                           <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-4d115e3754">If the kit is a combination of a number of
                              items around a theme (e.g., nail care kits and student "survival" kits), the class that
                              includes the majority of individual items in the kit controls the classification for the
                              entire kit.  Thus, a nail care kit comprising primarily nail polish, nail polish remover,
                              and false nails is classified in Class 3 even if it also includes nail files (Class 8) and
                              an instruction manual (Class 16).  In such cases, the identification must indicate the
                              type of kit and list the components, with the items in the predominant class listed first.
                               If the components of the kit do not appear to have a predominant class (e.g., the kit
                              contains two or three items, each in a different class), the applicant may elect which
                              class(es) the kit should be in, but the identification must still list the goods that
                              control the class first in the list of components.  A few specific types of kits are
                              listed in the ID Manual; other kits are classified on a case-by-case
                              basis.

                           <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-3d115e3769">It is sometimes difficult to determine whether
                              certain pieces of apparatus are classified in Class 9 or Class 10.  Class 9 goods include
                              those used for scientific research or industrial purposes, while Class 10 goods are used
                              for medical treatment or diagnostic purposes.  This distinction may mean that the same
                              goods could be classified in either class depending upon their use.  However, even if the
                              goods perform the same function, they are often different in nature, depending on whether
                              they are for industrial or research use, or for medical treatment or diagnostic use.  For
                              example, a thermometer for medical use is in Class 10, while thermometers other than for
                              medical use are in Class 9.  While both items measure temperature, they are usually very
                              different in nature.
                           </p>
                           <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-4d115e3772">Some goods are classified in Class 10 when
                              they are for medical use and in another class when they are not for medical use.  An item
                              should be specified as being for medical use if it could be in a class other than Class 10
                              when not for medical use.  For example, lasers for medical use are in Class 10, while
                              lasers not for medical use are in Class 9.  Items for use by invalids or handicapped
                              individuals are also classified in Class 10.  Thus, toilets adapted for handicapped
                              persons are in Class 10, while toilets (without any further specification) are in Class
                              11.  Finally, if an item is normally not classified in Class 10 (
                              <i>see</i>
                              the Class 11 example above), it is not necessary to specify that it is not for medical use
                              when it is classified in its normal class.  When that item is used for medical purposes,
                              the medical use must be specified in order to justify its classification in Class 10.  If
                              it is possible for an item to be commonly used for medical or non-medical purposes, its
                              purpose must be specified in the identification in order for it to be classified
                              appropriately (

                              international class. For example, “brake systems for vehicles” is an acceptable
                              identification in Class 12 because it is a generic term for a combination of goods
                              functioning as a unit to brake the vehicle. The ID Manual also lists additional acceptable

                              For example, “lecithin for culinary purposes” is classified in Class 29 because lecithin

                              classified in Class 30 because glucose is a sugar-like substance, and “sugar” is in the

                           affects the designation of the correct class.  For example, detergents for use in industrial
                           and manufacturing processes are classified in Class 1, not in Class 3 where other detergents
                           are classified.

                           for machines are generally classified with the machine if the part has no applicability
                           elsewhere.

                           as sheets, powders, or solutions, or as materials that may be either natural or synthetic),
                           these facts should be indicated in the identification of the goods.  This is important
                           because some raw materials are classified in several international classes; for example,
                           plastic in sheet form is in a different class from plastic in powder form, and synthetic
                           materials are in a different class from those that are natural.  Usually, a specimen will
                           disclose these characteristics of raw materials.

                        <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-7d115e3812">If the specimen indicates that a product is made
                           of a particular material, the identification should specify the material, because many
                           finished products are classified on the basis of the material composition of the article.
                            Generally, if a classification is dedicated to a particular type of goods, the material
                           composition for those goods does not have to be indicated in the identification.  For
                           example, Class 20 is the proper class for furniture.  This is true even when the furniture
                           is made of metal.  Metal furniture is not classified in Class 6 with other metal products
                           because there is an acceptable class (Class 20) for all furniture regardless of material
                           composition.  On the other hand, ladders do not have a specifically designated class, and
                           therefore they are classified by material composition:  metal ladders are in Class 6; wood
                           or plastic ladders are in Class 20; and rope ladders are in Class 22.

                        <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-3d115e3871">Effective January 1, 2002, the Nice Agreement
                           Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the
                           Registration of Marks (“Nice Agreement”) was amended to add three new service classes
                           (Classes 43 through 45).  These new classes arose from the extensive restructuring of Class
                           42.  In the course of that restructuring, many activities were removed from Class 42 and
                           placed in one of the three new classes.
                        </p>
                        <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-4d115e3874">The purpose of the Nice Classification is to
                           group, as much as possible, like goods or services in a single class.  Generally, the system
                           is successful in achieving that purpose.  However, over the years, it became apparent that
                           Class 42 included many disparate services.  This was due in large part to the inclusion of
                           the language “services that cannot be classified in other classes” in the class heading for
                           Class 42.  This language allowed services as different as “chemical research” and “horoscope
                           casting” to be included in the class.  Therefore, after much study and discussion, the
                           Committee of Experts for the Nice Agreement approved the restructuring of Class 42.  The
                           restructuring amended Class 42 by limiting the scope of the services included in this class
                           to computer, scientific, and legal services, and created three additional classes that
                           grouped services previously classified in Class 42 into new classes that kept like services
                           grouped together.

                              the revision of the Nice Agreement created an adequate number of well-defined classes so
                              that this language was no longer necessary.  Services must now be identified with
                              sufficient clarity and precision to allow for appropriate classification in one of the

                           are:  the transfer of all legal services from Class 42 to Class 45; the determination that
                           items made of precious metals should be classified according to their function rather than
                           in Class 14 merely because they are made of precious metal; and the transfer of aquaria and
                           related items from Class 16 to Class 21.  These changes are discussed below.

                           <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-3d115e3929">Effective January 1, 2007, legal services were
                              transferred from Class 42 to Class 45.  Class 42 is now limited to purely computer,
                              scientific, technological, engineering, and design services.
                           </p>
                           <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-4d115e3932">In 2002, when the Nice Agreement was amended
                              to add three new service classes, Class 42 was restructured, but legal services remained
                              in Class 42.  However, over the five-year revision period that led to the 9th edition, it
                              became apparent that Class 42 was not the most appropriate class for these services.  The
                              ultimate decision to include these services in Class 45 was based on an item in the class
                              heading for Class 45 - “security services for the protection of property and individuals.”
                               The Committee of Experts reasoned that legal services are an extension of the security
                              services already in Class 45.  Security services provide for the protection of property
                              and individuals, and the enforcement of that security is in the hands of the legal
                              profession.

                              Function
                           </h1>
                           <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-3d115e3944">Class 14 went through the most extensive
                              revision of all of the classes in the 9th edition of the Nice Agreement.  The Committee of
                              Experts decided that items made of precious metal that were classified in other classes
                              based on their function when not made of precious metal, should also be classified in
                              those classes.  Goods made of precious metal that are not classified by function, but
                              rather by material composition, e.g., statues, figurines, and key holders, are still
                              classified in Class 14.  This decision eliminated much of the confusion in this class
                              caused by some goods being listed in Class 14 when made of precious metal and in other
                              classes when not made of precious metal, while other goods were classified according to
                              function without reference to any particular material composition.  For example,
                              nutcrackers were classified in Class 14 when made of precious metal and in Class 8 when
                              not made of precious metal.  However, cutlery, namely forks, knives, and spoons were
                              classified only in Class 8, even if made of precious metal, even though it is not uncommon
                              for cutlery to be made of precious metal.  The changes in the 9th edition were intended to
                              eliminate this inconsistency.

                           <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-3d115e3957">Indoor aquaria, its related accessory aquarium
                              hoods, and indoor terrariums [vivariums] were previously classified in Class 16 because
                              they were considered educational.  This may have been true when they were first introduced
                              into the Nice Agreement list, but that is a minimal or secondary use today.  Most often,
                              these goods are found in homes or offices as hobby or decorative items.  They are
                              traditionally made of glass so that the contents are visible.  Therefore, they were
                              transferred to Class 21, the main class for other glass items.  Other aquarium items with
                              specific uses or functions remain in their 8th edition classes.  These items include
                              aerating pumps for aquaria in Class 7, aquarium gravel and sand in Class 19, and aquarium
                              lights, heaters, and filtering apparatus in Class 11.  However, large public aquaria that
                              are, in fact, structures are classified in Class 19, since they are made primarily from
                              nonmetallic materials.  The aquaria transferred from Class 16 to Class 21 are those that
                              may be found in homes or offices and would not be considered structures in the nature of a
                              building.

                           <p id="ch1400_d1d7f9_20492_323">Under the 10th edition, a number of
                              electric/electrothermic goods that were previously in Class 9 are now classified in the
                              same class as their non-electric or non-electrothermic counterparts.
                              Electric/electrothermic goods transferred from Class 9 to Class 7 include vending
                              machines, electric door openers, and electrodes for welding machines. Cigar lighters for
                              automobiles were transferred from Class 9 to Class 12 (as a land vehicle part). Automatic
                              turnstiles were deleted from Class 9 because they are considered building materials and
                              thus are classified according to material composition, with metal turnstiles classified in
                              Class 6 and non-metal turnstiles classified in Class 19. The ID Manual should be consulted
                              for the identification and classification of other electric/electrothermic

                           <p id="ch1400_d1d7f9_206ec_3dd">Under the 10th edition Nice Alphabetical List,
                              food additives are classified in Classes 1, 5, and 29-33 according to their particular
                              purposes. Previously, the Nice Alphabetical List recognized only two types of food
                              additives - those for medical purposes in Class 5 and those in the nature of raw materials
                              in Class 1. The 9th edition was silent on the classification of food additives used as
                              ingredients in cooking and/or baking for domestic purposes. Under the 10th edition, food
                              additives for industrial purposes, including those for use in manufacturing food, are
                              classified in Class 1. Additionally, food additives for medical purposes and for use as
                              dietary supplements are classified in Class 5, and food additives for culinary purposes
                              are classified in Classes 29-33, according to the particular nature of the food additive.
                              The 10th edition also requires that the food additive be specifically named (e.g.,
                              “lecithin for culinary purposes” in Class 29). This requirement is especially important
                              when the food additives are for culinary purposes because classification of such goods is
                              determined by their nature.

                              being “adapted for medical use” (or include other language indicating that these items are
                              adapted for a particular medical use) to make clear that their purpose and use are not as
                              part of a regular diet for human beings or animals. The specific meal replacement,

                              inclusion discussed above. Previously, all meal replacements were classified in Class 5,
                              and the Nice Agreement was silent regarding how to classify dietetic food and beverages
                              that were not for medical or veterinary purposes. Meal replacements and dietetic food and
                              beverages that are not for medical or veterinary use must now be identified with adequate
                              specificity to determine the particular food or beverages classes in which they should be

                              after that term.  For example, “clothing, namely, hats, caps, sweaters, and jeans” is an
                              acceptable identification of goods in Class 25 and shows proper use of
                              commas.

                              separate distinct categories of goods or services within a single class.  For example,

                              pets” is an acceptable identification in Class 3.  In this example, the word “cleaners”
                              names the category covering “glass cleaners, oven cleaners, and carpet cleaners.”  The
                              semicolon prior to “deodorizers for pets” indicates that the deodorizers are a separate

                              semicolons properly when identifying items that are part of a kit.  In general, items that
                              are to be sold together (e.g., as components of a system or kit) should be separated by
                              commas.  However, other goods within the same class that are to be sold independently of
                              the kit or system should be separated by semicolons.  This is an exception to the general
                              rule regarding using semicolons to separate categories of goods.  Here the semicolons are
                              used to separate items that in a non-kit identification would be separated by commas.  For
                              example, an identification that includes kits comprised of several items, as well as other
                              goods sold independently from the kits, should be punctuated as follows:  “beauty
                              supplies, namely, makeup kits comprised of makeup, lipstick, eye shadow, and applicator
                              brushes; skin lotions; moisturizing soaps; and facial scrubs.”  The use of “and” before
                              “applicator brushes” indicates that they are the final items contained in the kit.  The
                              use of semicolons indicates that “skin lotions,” “moisturizing soaps,” and “facial scrubs”
                              are separate items and are not included in the make-up kits.

                              must establish that the applicant’s proposed use of the mark for a full line of products
                              is credible.  The nature of the mark and the capacity of the applicant to use the mark as
                              asserted should be considered in determining whether the claim that the mark is to be used
                              for a full line of products is credible.  If the applicant indicates such an intention,
                              the examining attorney should advise the applicant that, upon filing of the allegation of
                              use, the applicant will be required to provide evidence to substantiate use for a full
                              line of products.  37 C.F.R. §2.61(b). If the applicant cannot do so, the applicant will

                              to substantiate the claim of use as a mark for a “full line of” a genre of products.
                               37 C.F.R. §2.61(b).  For example, in the pharmaceutical context, proof of use in

                              avoid the issuance of unnecessary refusals of registration under 15 U.S.C. §1052(d) where
                              the actual goods of the parties are not related and there is no conflict in the

                              in that field is indicated.  For example, “computer programs for use in cancer diagnosis”
                              or “computer programs for use in teaching children to read” would be

                              can never be sufficient to specify the nature of the computer program adequately.  For

                           computer game, could also be accurately identified as “computer game software,” noting that

                           among players seeking after-market add-ons or enhancements for existing games.”  Therefore,
                           it would not be inaccurate to identify such software simply as “computer game

                              distinguishable part, component, or ingredient of a composite or finished product, then
                              the application should identify that component or ingredient as the goods.  The

                              entire product.  Also, the identification should indicate the types of finished products
                              of which the identified components or ingredients form a part, e.g., “liposomes sold as an
                              ingredient in face creams.”

                              composition, then the material composition must be indicated in the identification of the

                                 precious metal” are classified in Class 14; “statues of wax, wood, plaster, or plastic”

                                  If it does not, a more appropriate identification would be “providing a website on the

                                 broad enough to encompass both printed and online publications.  On the other hand, if

                              sure that the website or information services 
                              <i>did</i> provide information

                              which it is providing information so that the service can be accurately classified.  The
                              fields may be listed somewhat broadly, but with enough specificity to allow
                              classification.  “Bundling” of the fields of information (that is, listing all fields of
                              information but allowing the dominant or most significant field to control the
                              classification with the other fields simply “along for the ride”) is no longer
                              acceptable.

                           <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-5d115e5856">Since information services must now be
                              classified according to the subject matter of the information, the nature or subject
                              matter of the information provided must be specified to allow for proper classification.
                               For example, “information in the field of automobiles” is not sufficiently definite to
                              allow for proper classification.  If the information pertains to purchasing an automobile,
                              then the service is classified in Class 35.  If the information pertains to the care and
                              maintenance of automobiles, the service is classified in Class 37.  If the service
                              involves insurance or financing of automobiles, then Class 36 is the proper class.  The
                              best way to ensure that the information is classified correctly may be to identify the
                              subject matter of the service.  For example, “information in the field of automobile
                              financing” is adequate to classify the service in Class 36.  Another way to clarify the
                              classification of information services is to characterize the information itself.  Thus,
                              “providing financing information in the field of automobiles” clearly puts the service in
                              Class 36.  As with many other service identifications that require an indication of the
                              subject matter or field, the subject matter or field does not have to be as specific as
                              would be required if the subject matter or field were the service itself.  However, an
                              indication of the nature of the information must be included, either by reference to the
                              type of information or the subject matter of the information provided, to allow for proper
                              classification of the activity.

                              applicant to indicate the fields of information to assist in classification.  The
                              applicant must decide if it wishes to:  (1) go forward and register the information
                              services in all of the appropriate classes; or (2) choose the class(es) that are most

                              42 because it encompasses consulting about the information technology related to the

                           <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-3d115e5986">The services of production and distribution of
                              motion pictures and television programs are classified in Class 41.  This service involves
                              the actual creation of the motion picture or television program and the accompanying
                              activity of distributing it to movie theatres and television stations for display to the
                              public.  In this service, the ownership of the physical product does not leave the
                              producer.  The movie theatre or television stations ”lease” (in a sense) the film or tape
                              for a period of time and then return it to the producer.  This is not the case when
                              distribution relates to videotapes, audiotapes, or other hard goods that result from the
                              production of visual or audio entertainment.  When these goods are distributed, it is the
                              same as the distribution of any other kind of hard goods by any other manufacturer.  The
                              ownership of the physical product is transferred to the purchaser just as it is with
                              clothing, toys, food products, or computers.  For this reason, the identification
                              “distribution of videotapes, audiotapes, videodiscs, etc.” should not be accepted as a
                              service even when the distribution is linked to the production of these goods.  The
                              production of the entertainment product is perfectly acceptable in Class 41; however, the
                              distribution of the hard goods that result from that production is not a service in that
                              class.  It is possible that such distribution could be considered a distributorship
                              service in Class 35, but that must be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Distribution of
                              one‘s own goods is not a service; it is merely a necessary part of doing business.
                               However, if the applicant distributes the videotapes, audiotapes, etc. of others as well
                              as those it has produced, it may be identified as a distributorship service in Class
                              35.

                              concert or studio performance is not considered a service of the performing group.
                               Similarly, performances for the sole purpose of recording are not considered services.
                               The production by another entity of a performance by a musical group for recordation
                              would be a service, but an identification such as "live and recorded performances by a
                              musical group" could not be accepted as a valid service identification unless the words
                              "and recorded" were deleted.

                              consistent with the treatment of "distribution" of these products as goods and not

                              "frequent patron programs" to encourage patronage of that business.  However, promotion of
                              one’s own goods or services is not considered a service under the Lanham Act since the
                              beneficiary of such an activity is the business itself and not a third party.

                              the customers who participate in the program, but this benefit flows directly from use of
                              the trademark owner’s goods or services.  Thus, a frequent flyer program provided by an
                              airline to encourage use of its own air transportation services would be identified as
                              "air transportation services featuring a frequent flyer bonus program" and it would be
                              classified in Class 39.  Similarly, a retail store that has a program through which
                              patrons earn points that result in discounts on future purchases at that store would be
                              identified as "retail store services in the field of [indicate field] featuring a frequent
                              patron program in which points are accumulated to be used for discounts on future
                              purchases."  This service would be in Class 35 because it is primarily a retail store
                              service.  It should be noted that organizing and conducting a program of this type for a
                              third party is a promotion/advertising service and would be classified in Class 35 and
                              identified with language such as "promoting the goods and services of others by means of a
                              point accumulation program with points used for discounts on future purchases of those
                              goods and services" (or whatever the details of the program may be).

                              are usually classified in Classes 35 and 41.  Classification depends upon the purpose of
                              the award program.  If the award program is an employee incentive rewarding excellence in
                              job-related performance that actually furthers the business of an employer (e.g., safety,
                              quality, productivity, customer service), then the service is classified in Class 35.  If
                              the award program is to recognize excellence or achievement that may or may not be related
                              to the participants’ business or professional endeavors (e.g., achievements in community
                              service, excellence in country music performance), then the service should be classified
                              in Class 41.  The distinction is that Class 35 award programs do further the business
                              interests of an employer by encouraging positive business-related performance, while Class
                              41 award programs reward excellence for endeavors that do not further the business

                        <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-3d115e6066">Generally, parentheses and brackets should not
                           be used in identifications of goods and services.  The Post Registration Section of the
                           USPTO uses single brackets to indicate that goods/services have been deleted from a
                           registration either by amendment under 15 U.S.C. §1057, filing of a partial affidavit of
                           continued use under 15 U.S.C. §1058 or 15 U.S.C. §1141k, or filing of a partial renewal
                           application under 15 U.S.C. §1059.  The Post Registration Section also uses double
                           parentheses to indicate that certain goods or services are not claimed in an affidavit of
                           incontestability under 15 U.S.C. §1065.  See

                           not use parentheses and brackets in the identification of goods or services in an
                           application.  The only time parentheses may be used in an identification is when the
                           parentheses merely explain or translate the matter preceding the parenthetical phrase in
                           such a way that it does not affect the clarity of the identification.

                        <p id="TMEP-ch-1400-5d115e6072">For example, “bags (tote)” in Class 18 would not
                           be an acceptable use of parentheses.  If the identification were misinterpreted to mean that
                           “tote” was no longer part of the identification of goods (due to an amendment of the goods,
                           or filing of a partial affidavit of continued use or renewal application, the item would
                           merely read “bags.”  That would create an ambiguity within Class 18, since it could refer to
                           any type of bag – from an all-purpose sports bag to an evening bag – and it would make a
                           determination of likelihood of confusion difficult.  Also, some bags are in classes other
                           than Class 18.  Without an indication of the type of bag, classification of the goods is
                           problematic.

                           (Japanese sash)” in Class 25 would be acceptable because the parenthetical phrase merely
                           provides further information about the goods.
