<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-3d125e527"> Owners of marks registered under the Acts of 1905 or 1881 may claim the benefits of the Act of 1946, but are not required to do so. Trademark Act §12(c), 15 U.S.C. §1062(c). The 1946 Act refers to a “registrant” claiming the benefits of the Act. The term “registrant” includes both the original registrant and a person who has acquired ownership through proper transfer of title.  <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. §1127. The claim must be made by the person who owns the mark at the time the claim is made. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-4d125e533">To claim the benefits of the Act of 1946, the owner of the registration must file an affidavit or a declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20. The affidavit or declaration must: (1) set forth those items listed in the registration on which the mark is currently in use in commerce; (2) state that the benefits of the Act of 1946 are claimed for the mark; (3) be accompanied by the fee required by 37 C.F.R. §2.6; and (4) be filed by the owner and signed by a person properly authorized to sign on behalf of the owner. 37 C.F.R. §2.153. No specimen is required. Goods or services not listed in the affidavit or declaration will be deleted from the registration. The affidavit or declaration under §12(c) of the Act may be filed at any time during the life of the registration.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-5d125e536"> A claim of the benefits of the 1946 Act does <i>not</i> affect or alter the <i>term</i> of the 1905 or 1881 Act registration. These registrations still remain in force for the times indicated in

The USPTO notifies the registrant of the printing of the mark in the <i>Official Gazette</i> , and also informs the registrant of the requirement for filing affidavits or declarations of use or excusable nonuse under 15 U.S.C. §1058. 37 C.F.R. §2.155.

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-6d125e1871"> The purpose of Section 8 of the Trademark Act is to remove from the register those registrations that have become deadwood.  <i>See Morehouse Mfg. Corp. v. J. Strickland &amp; Co.,</i> 407 F.2d 881, 160 USPQ 715 (C.C.P.A. 1969). It is not intended, however, to cancel registrations because of a temporary interruption in the use of the mark due to circumstances beyond the control of the owner of the registration.  <i>In re Moorman Mfg. Co.,</i> 203 USPQ 712 (Comm’r Pats. 1979). Thus, if the mark is not in use in commerce but the owner believes the registration should not be cancelled, the owner may file an affidavit or declaration showing that nonuse is due to special circumstances that excuse the nonuse, and is not due to any intention to abandon the mark. 15 U.S.C. §1058(b)(2).  <i>Ex parte Kelley-How-Thomson Co.</i> , 118 USPQ 40 (Comm’r Pats. 1958).

<i>Requirements for Affidavit or Declaration</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-8d125e1887"> Since "showing" implies proof, merely stating that special circumstances exist and there is no intention to abandon the mark is not sufficient.  <i>In re Conusa Corp.,</i> 32 USPQ2d 1857 (Comm'r Pats. 1993); <i>In re Moorman Mfg.

The affidavit or declaration must state when use in commerce stopped and give the approximate date when use is expected to resume. 37 C.F.R. §2.161(f)(2). If the mark was registered under §44(e) and the owner was unable to commence use due to special circumstances beyond the owner’s control that excuse the nonuse, the owner should state that the mark was never in use and give the approximate date when use is expected to begin. Affidavits or declarations should also specify the reason for nonuse, the specific steps being taken to put the mark back in use, and any other relevant facts to support a finding of excusable nonuse. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-9d125e1899"> Sufficient facts must be set forth to demonstrate clearly that nonuse is due to some special circumstance beyond the owner's control or "forced by outside causes."  <i>In re Conusa Corp., supra</i> ; <i>In re Moorman Mfg. Co., supra;</i>

<i>Imperial Tobacco Ltd. v. Phillip Morris Inc.</i> , 899 F.2d 1575, 14 USPQ2d 1390 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <i>Stromgren Supports Inc. v. Bike Athletic Co.,</i> 43 USPQ2d 1100 (TTAB 1997).

<i>Examples of Special Circumstances That Do and Do Not Excuse Nonuse</i>
</p>
</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-15d125e1945">In addition to a showing that there is no intention to abandon the mark, the owner must show that nonuse is due to special circumstances beyond the owner's control that excuse nonuse. The following examples provide general guidelines as to what is considered to be a special circumstance that excuses nonuse:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull"> <i>Business Decision. </i> Nonuse related to a business decision is not beyond the owner’s control and does not excuse nonuse. 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Decreased Demand</i> . Decreased demand for the product sold under the mark, resulting in its discontinuance for an indefinite period, does not excuse nonuse. The purpose of the requirement for an affidavit or declaration is to eliminate registrations of marks that are in nonuse due to ordinary changes in social or economic conditions.  <i>See</i>
<i>In re Conusa Corp</i> ., <i>supra</i> ; <i>In re Parmalat S.p.A</i> ., 32 USPQ2d 1860 (Comm’r Pats. 1991); <i>Ex parte Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Inc</i> ., <i>supra</i> ; <i>Ex parte Denver Chemical Mfg. Co</i> ., <i>supra</i> . 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Trade Embargo or Other Circumstance Beyond Owner’s Control</i> . Nonuse may be considered excusable where the owner of the registration is willing and able to continue use of the mark in commerce, but is unable to do so due to a trade embargo. 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Sale of a Business</i> . Temporary nonuse due to the sale of a business might be considered excusable. 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Retooling</i> . The mark might be out of use temporarily because of an interruption of production for retooling of a plant or equipment, with production possible again at a scheduled time. However, nonuse due to retooling is excusable only if the owner shows that the plant or equipment being retooled was essential to the production of the goods and that alternative equipment was unavailable on the market.  <i>In re New England Mutual Life Insurance Co</i> ., 33 USPQ2d 1532 (Comm’r Pats. 1991). 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Orders on Hand</i> . If the product is of a type that cannot be produced quickly or in large numbers (e.g., airplanes), yet there are orders on hand and activity toward filling them, nonuse might be considered excusable. 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Illness, Fire, and Other Catastrophes</i> . Illness, fire, and other catastrophes may create situations of temporary nonuse, with the owner being able to outline arrangements and plans for resumption of use. Such nonuse is often excusable. However, a mere statement that the owner is ill and cannot conduct his or her business will not in itself excuse nonuse; the owner must show that the business is an operation that could not continue without his or her presence.  <i>New England Mutual Life Insurance, supra</i> . 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Negotiations with Distributors</i> . A recitation of efforts to negotiate agreements that would allow for resumption of use of the mark, or a statement that samples of the goods have been shipped to potential distributors, may establish lack of intention to abandon the mark, but does not establish the existence of special circumstances that excuse the nonuse.  <i>In re Parmalat, supra; In re Moorman, supra</i> . 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Use in Foreign Country</i> . Use of the mark in a foreign country has no bearing on excusable nonuse of a mark in commerce that can be regulated by the United States Congress.  <i>In re Conusa, supra</i> . 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Use of Mark on Different Goods/Services</i> . Use of the mark on goods/services other than those recited in the registration does not establish either special circumstances or lack of intention to abandon the mark.  <i>Ex parte Kelley-How-Thomson Co., supra</i> . 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Use of Mark in Another Form</i> . Use of a mark as an essential part of a materially different composite mark does not excuse the failure to use the mark at issue.  <i>In re Continental Distilling Corp</i> ., 254 F.2d 139, 117 USPQ 300 (C.C.P.A. 1958).

If it cannot, the Post Registration staff must ask the owner to submit: (1) the specimen (or a facsimile of the specimen) that was attached to the original electronically filed affidavit or declaration; and (2) a statement by the person who transmitted the affidavit or declaration to the USPTO that the specimen being submitted is a true copy of the specimen submitted with the electronically filed affidavit or declaration. This statement does not have to be verified. Alternatively, the owner may submit a new specimen, together with an affidavit or declaration that the substitute specimen was in use in commerce on or in connection with the goods/services during the relevant period specified in §8 of the Act.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-3d125e2265"> The mark to which the §8 affidavit or declaration pertains must be essentially the same as the mark that appears in the registration. Where the specimen reflects a change in the mark since the registration issued, acceptance of the affidavit or declaration will depend on the degree of change. A <i>material</i> alteration of the mark will result in refusal of the affidavit or declaration on the ground that the registered mark is no longer in use.  <i>In re Int’l Nickel Co., Inc.</i> , 282 F.2d 952, 127 USPQ 331 (C.C.P.A. 1960); <i>In re Continental Distilling Corp.</i> , 254 F.2d 139, 117 USPQ 300 (C.C.P.A. 1958); <i>Ex parte Richards,</i> 153 USPQ 853 (Comm’r Pats. 1967).  <i>See also Torres v. Cantine Torresella S.r.l.</i> , 808 F.2d 46, 1 USPQ2d 1483 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <i>In re Holland American Wafer Co</i> ., 737 F.2d 1015, 222 USPQ 273 (Fed. Cir. 1984). 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-4d125e2287"> Mere changes in background or styling, or modernization, are not ordinarily considered to be material changes in the mark.  <i>See Ex parte Petersen &amp; Pegau Baking Co.,</i> 100 USPQ 20 (Comm’r Pats. 1953) (change in matter determined to be mere background and type face held not a material alteration of “PETER PAN” mark). Whether the change in a mark as used on the specimen is a material change is a question of fact that the Post Registration staff must determine on a case-by-case basis. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-5d125e2293"> Generally, the standard used to determine whether a change is material under §8 is the same as the standard used to determine whether the mark in a registration may be amended under 15 U.S.C. §1057(e). If the mark could be amended under §7(e) because the character of the mark had not been materially altered, then the specimen filed with the §8 affidavit or declaration should be accepted. In determining whether a change constitutes a material alteration, the USPTO will always compare the mark in the specimen to the mark as originally registered. See TMEP §§ 

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1885">807.14</a>

<i>et seq</i> . and

 for additional information about material alteration. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-6d125e2306"> However, where the registered mark is currently used as one of several elements in a composite mark, the decision as to whether to accept the specimen requires consideration of whether the registered mark makes an impression apart from the other elements of the composite mark. If the display of the composite is such that the essence of the registered mark makes a separate impression, then the specimen may be sufficient for purposes of the §8 requirement. In many cases, word elements are severable from design elements, because words tend to dominate in forming a commercial impression.  <i>In re DeWitt Int’l Corp.</i> , 21 USPQ2d 1620 (Comm’r Pats. 1991). If the mark, as used on the §8 specimen, creates a separate impression apart from any other material on the specimen, then the specimen may be accepted as evidence of current use of the registered mark. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-7d125e2312"> If the USPTO determines that the mark on the specimen is a material alteration of the registered mark, the owner may file a substitute specimen. If the owner files a substitute specimen after expiration of the relevant filing period specified in §8 of the Act, the owner must pay the deficiency surcharge required by §8(c) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1058(c), and 37 C.F.R. §2.6.

If the owner wants to change the mark in the registration to agree with the mark currently used, the owner must file a separate request for amendment under §7(e) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1057(e), and pay the fee required by 37 C.F.R. §2.6.  <i>See Ex parte Petersen &amp; Pegau Baking Co.</i> , 100 USPQ 20 (Comm’r Pats. 1953).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-3d125e2761"> Section 15 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1065, provides a procedure by which the exclusive right to use a registered mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services covered by the registration can become “incontestable,” if the owner of the registration files an affidavit or declaration stating that the mark has been in continuous use in commerce for a period of five years after the date of registration. To expedite processing, it is recommended that the owner file the §15 affidavit or declaration through TEAS, available at 

<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/teas/e-TEAS/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.uspto.gov</a>

<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-4d125e2773">Under §33(b) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. §1115(b), if the right to use the mark has become incontestable under §15, then the registration is conclusive evidence of the validity of the registered mark and its registration, of the registrant’s ownership of the mark, and of the owner’s exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce, subject to certain defenses and exceptions. Sections 15 and 33(b) apply only to registrations issued on the Principal Register.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-5d125e2776">Filing an affidavit or declaration of incontestability under §15 of the Trademark Act (“§15 affidavit or declaration”) is optional. An eligible registrant may choose to claim the benefits of incontestability and file an appropriate affidavit or declaration, or may elect to retain the registration without those benefits. The requirements for maintaining and renewing a federal registration are not affected.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-6d125e2780"> The USPTO does not “accept” §15 affidavits or declarations.  <i>Arman’s Systems, Inc. v. Armand’s Subway, Inc.</i> , 215 USPQ 1048, 1050 n.2. (TTAB 1982). Rather, the USPTO reviews the affidavit or declaration to determine whether it is consistent with the requirements of the statute and rules (e.g. <i>,</i> whether it is signed, whether it was filed at an appropriate time, and whether the §15 claims are properly set forth). 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-7d125e2789">When a §15 affidavit or declaration complies with the requirements of the statute and rules, the USPTO updates its records to acknowledge receipt of the affidavit or declaration and sends a notice of acknowledgment to the owner of the registration. Acknowledging receipt of the affidavit or declaration provides notice to the public that an affidavit or declaration of incontestability has been filed; it is not a determination by the USPTO that the registration is in fact incontestable. The question of whether the registration is incontestable arises and is determined by a court if there is a proceeding involving the mark.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-8d125e2792"> If the §15 affidavit or declaration does not comply with the statute and rules, the USPTO issues a written action notifying the owner of any inconsistency or error, but does not require correction. If the §15 affidavit or declaration is filed alone, the owner is given six months from the issuance date of the Office action to file a response. If it is filed as part of a combined affidavit or declaration under §§8 and 15 or §§71 and 15, and there are issues in the Office action relating to both parts of the combined filing, the owner must file a response within six months of the issuance date of the Office action, or before the end of the relevant filing period set forth in §8(a) or §71(a), whichever is later. <i>See</i> TMEP §§

<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-3d125e4157">
<i>Mark in Registered Extension of Protection Cannot be Amended</i>
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-4d125e4160"> The holder of a registered extension of protection of an international registration to the United States cannot file a request to amend the mark under §7 of the Trademark Act. A registered extension of protection remains part of the international registration, and all requests to record changes to such a registration must be filed at the IB. However, the Madrid Protocol and the <i>Common Regulations Under the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks and the Protocol Relating to That Agreement</i> (“Common Regs.”) do not permit amendment of the mark in an international registration. If the holder of the international registration wants to change the mark in any way, even slightly, the holder must file a new international application. The IB’s <i>Guide to the International Registration of Marks under the Madrid Agreement and the Madrid Protocol</i> (2008) <i>(“Guide to International Registration”)</i> , Para. B.II.72.02, provides as follows: 
</p>
<blockquote id="">
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-1d125e4174">[T]here is no provision for a mark that is recorded in the International Register to be amended in any way, either on renewal or at any other time. If the holder wishes to protect the mark in a form which differs, even slightly, from the mark as recorded, he must file a new international application. This is true even if the mark has been allowed to be changed in the basic application, the registration resulting from the basic application or the basic registration....
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-6d125e4179">Therefore, the mark in a registered extension of protection cannot be amended.
</p>
<p id="ch1600_d1b201_2a3cd_2b0"> Although the mark in a registered extension of protection cannot be amended, in some situations the holder of a registered extension of protection may file a request under §7 of the Trademark Act to add a standard character claim. If the international registration does not indicate that the mark is in standard characters, and the holder seeks to amend the registered extension of protection to add a standard character claim, the Post Registration staff must contact the Supervisor of the Madrid Processing Unit (“MPU”) via e-mail for instructions on how to proceed. The holder may not add a standard character claim unless the mark meets the United States requirements for a standard character claim, as set forth in 37 C.F.R. §2.52(a). See TMEP §§

<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-3d125e4205"> Section 7(e) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1057(e), prohibits an amendment that materially alters the character of the mark. “Material alteration” is the standard for evaluating amendments to marks at all relevant stages of processing, both during examination of the application and after registration.  <i>See</i> 37 C.F.R. §§2.72 and 2.173(d); 

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1885">TMEP §§807.14</a>

<i>et seq</i> . 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-4d125e4217"> In determining whether a proposed amendment is a material alteration of a registered mark, the USPTO will always compare the proposed amendment to the mark <i>as originally registered</i> . 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-5d125e4223">The general test of whether an alteration is material is whether, if the mark in an application for registration had been published, the change would require republication in order to present the mark fairly for purposes of opposition. If republication would be required, the amendment is a material alteration.
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-6d125e4227"> An amendment of a registered mark is acceptable if the modified mark contains the essence of the original mark (i.e., the mark as originally registered), and the mark as amended creates essentially the same impression as the original mark.  <i>In re Umax Data System, Inc.</i> , 40 USPQ2d 1539 (Comm’r Pats. 1996). For example, in marks consisting of wording combined with a design, if the word is the essence of the mark and the design is merely background embellishment or display that is not integrated into the mark in any significant way, the removal or change of the design will not be a material alteration of the mark.  <i>See Ex parte Petersen &amp; Pegau Baking Co.</i> , 100 USPQ 20 (Comm’r Pats. 1953). On the other hand, if a design is integrated into a mark and is a distinctive feature necessary for recognition of the mark, then a change in the design would materially alter the mark.  <i>See In re Dillard Department Stores, Inc.,</i> 33 USPQ2d 1052 (Comm’r Pats. 1993) (proposed deletion of highly stylized display features of mark “IN•VEST•MENTS” held to be a material alteration); <i>Ex parte Kadane-Brown, Inc.</i> , 79 USPQ 307 (Comm’r Pats. 1948) (proposed amendment of “BLUE BONNET” mark to delete a star design and to change the picture of the girl held a material alteration). 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-7d125e4242"> When a mark is solely a picture or design, an alteration must be evaluated by determining whether the new form has the same commercial impression as the original mark, i.e., whether the form as altered would be likely to be recognized as the same mark.  <i>See Ex parte Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co.,</i> 136 USPQ 379 (Comm’r Pats. 1963) (proposed amendment to delete circle found to be a material alteration, where the circle was determined to be a prominent element of a design mark). 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-8d125e4248"> Marks entirely comprised of words can sometimes be varied as to their style of lettering, size, and other elements of form without resulting in a material alteration of the mark.  <i>See Ex parte Squire Dingee Co.</i> , 81 USPQ 258, <i>recon. denied,</i> 81 USPQ 543 (Comm’r Pats. 1949) (amendment from block lettering to script not a material alteration). However, changing from special form to standard characters, or the reverse, may be a material alteration.

<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-9d125e4260"> A generic or purely informational term may be deleted if the essence of the mark in appearance or meaning is not changed, but a word or feature that is necessary to the significance of the mark may not be deleted. Likewise, a unique or prominent design feature may not be deleted.  <i>See In re Richards-Wilcox Mfg. Co.</i> , 181 USPQ 735 (Comm’r Pats. 1974), <i>overruled on other grounds, In re Umax Data System, Inc.,</i> 40 USPQ2d 1539 (Comm'r Pats. 1996) (proposed amendment to block lettering from mark comprising a diamond design surrounding the word “FYER-WALL” with an inverted channel bracket around the letters “RW” held a material alteration).

 as to persons properly authorized to verify facts on behalf of an owner. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-6d125e4327"> One specimen per class showing use of the proposed mark as amended on or in connection with the goods or services is required, even if the mark originally registered based on a foreign registration under §44 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1126(e) or an extension of protection of an international registration to the United States under §66(a) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1141f(a).

</p>
<p id="ch1600_d1d845_16e1c_1c9">Sometimes, it may be necessary for the USPTO to request additional information in order to properly examine the amendment. In such cases, the USPTO will require the owner to furnish such additional information, specimens, exhibits, and affidavits or declarations as may be reasonably necessary to the proper examination of the §7 amendment. 37 C.F.R. §2.173(b)(4).

Section 12(a) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §1062(a), requires examination and publication prior to registration. Therefore, the error can be corrected only by canceling the registration as inadvertently issued and republishing the mark with the correct information. Depending on the circumstances, the USPTO may give the owner the option of either: (1) keeping the registration as issued; or (2) having the registration cancelled as inadvertently issued and republishing the mark.

In this situation, the registration will be cancelled as inadvertently issued and the application will be returned to examination.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-5d125e4938"> Any such order affecting a registration must be <i>certified</i> to the USPTO, and should be addressed to the Office of the Solicitor, Mail Stop 8, Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, P.O.

If an examining attorney determines that 30 days have passed since the expiration of the grace period, but the Trademark database does not indicate that the registration is cancelled or expired, the examining attorney should contact the Supervisor of the Post Registration Section and request that the database be updated to show that the registration is cancelled or expired. If a party other than the examining attorney determines that 30 days have passed since the expiration of the grace period, but the Trademark database does not indicate that the registration is cancelled or expired, the party should contact the Trademark Assistance Center at (571) 272-9250 or (800) 786-9199 and request that the database be updated to show that the registration is cancelled or expired.

<i>Examples of Special Circumstances That Do and Do Not Excuse Nonuse</i>
</p>
</div>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-15d125e6250">In addition to a showing that there is no intention to abandon the mark, the holder must show that nonuse is due to special circumstances beyond the holder's control that excuse nonuse. The following examples provide general guidelines as to what is considered to be a special circumstance that excuses nonuse:
</p>
<ul >
<li class="nobull"> <i>Business Decision. </i> Nonuse related to a business decision is not beyond the holder’s control and does not excuse nonuse. 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Decreased Demand</i> . Decreased demand for the product sold under the mark, resulting in its discontinuance for an indefinite period, does not excuse nonuse. The purpose of the requirement for an affidavit or declaration is to eliminate registrations of marks that are in nonuse due to ordinary changes in social or economic conditions.  <i>See</i>
<i>In re Conusa Corp</i> ., <i>supra</i> ; <i>In re Parmalat S.p.A</i> ., 32 USPQ2d 1860 (Comm’r Pats. 1991); <i>Ex parte Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Inc</i> ., <i>supra</i> ; <i>Ex parte Denver Chemical Mfg. Co</i> ., <i>supra</i> . 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Trade Embargo or Other Circumstance Beyond Holder’s Control</i> . Nonuse may be considered excusable where the holder of the registration is willing and able to continue use of the mark in commerce, but is unable to do so due to a trade embargo. 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Sale of a Business</i> . Temporary nonuse due to the sale of a business might be considered excusable. 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Retooling</i> . The mark might be out of use temporarily because of an interruption of production for retooling of a plant or equipment, with production possible again at a scheduled time. However, nonuse due to retooling is excusable only if the holder shows that the plant or equipment being retooled was essential to the production of the goods and that alternative equipment was unavailable on the market.  <i>See</i>
<i>In re New England Mutual Life Insurance Co</i> ., 33 USPQ2d 1532 (Comm’r Pats. 1991). 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Orders on Hand</i> . If the product is of a type that cannot be produced quickly or in large numbers (e.g., airplanes), yet there are orders on hand and activity toward filling them, nonuse might be considered excusable. 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Illness, Fire, and Other Catastrophes</i> . Illness, fire, and other catastrophes may create situations of temporary nonuse, with the holder being able to outline arrangements and plans for resumption of use. Such nonuse is often excusable. However, a mere statement that the holder is ill and cannot conduct his or her business will not in itself excuse nonuse; the holder must show that the business is an operation that could not continue without his or her presence.  <i>See</i>
<i>New England Mutual Life Insurance, supra</i> . 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Negotiations with Distributors</i> . A recitation of efforts to negotiate agreements that would allow for resumption of use of the mark, or a statement that samples of the goods have been shipped to potential distributors, may establish lack of intention to abandon the mark, but does not establish the existence of special circumstances that excuse the nonuse.  <i>See In re Parmalat, supra; In re Moorman, supra</i> . 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Use in Foreign Country</i> . Use of the mark in a foreign country has no bearing on excusable nonuse of a mark in commerce that can be regulated by the United States Congress.  <i>See</i>
<i>In re Conusa, supra</i> . 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Use of Mark on Different Goods/Services</i> . Use of the mark on goods/services other than those recited in the registration does not establish either special circumstances or lack of intention to abandon the mark.  <i>See Ex parte Kelley-How-Thomson Co., supra</i> . 
</li>
<li class="nobull"> <i>Use of Mark in Another Form</i> . Use of a mark as an essential part of a materially different composite mark does not excuse the failure to use the mark at issue.  <i>See In re Continental Distilling Corp</i> ., 254 F.2d 139, 117 USPQ 300 (C.C.P.A. 1958).

<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-3d125e6576"> The mark to which the §71 affidavit or declaration pertains must be essentially the same as the mark that appears in the registration. Where the specimen reflects a change in the mark since the registration issued, acceptance of the affidavit or declaration will depend on the degree of change. A <i>material</i> alteration of the mark will result in refusal of the affidavit or declaration on the ground that the registered mark is no longer in use.  <i>See</i>
<i>In re Int’l Nickel Co., Inc.</i> , 282 F.2d 952, 127 USPQ 331 (C.C.P.A. 1960); <i>In re Continental Distilling Corp.</i> , 254 F.2d 139, 117 USPQ 300 (C.C.P.A. 1958); <i>Ex parte Richards,</i> 153 USPQ 853 (Comm’r Pats. 1967).  <i>See also Torres v.

</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-4d125e6600"> Mere changes in background or styling, or modernization, are not ordinarily considered to be material changes in the mark.  <i>See Ex parte Petersen &amp; Pegau Baking Co.,</i> 100 USPQ 20 (Comm’r Pats. 1953) (change in matter determined to be mere background and type face held not a material alteration of “PETER PAN” mark). Whether the change in a mark as used on the specimen is a material change is a question of fact that the Post Registration staff must determine on a case-by-case basis. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-5d125e6606"> Generally, the standard used to determine whether a change is material under §71 is the same as the standard used to determine whether the mark in a registration based on an application under §1 or §44 of the Trademark Act may be amended under 15 U.S.C. §1057(e). If the mark could be amended under §7(e) because the character of the mark had not been materially altered, then the specimen filed with the §71 affidavit or declaration should be accepted. In determining whether a change constitutes a material alteration, the USPTO will always compare the mark in the specimen to the mark as originally registered. See TMEP §§ 

<a href="tmep-0800.html#TMEP-800d1e1885">807.14</a>

 for additional information about material alteration. 
</p>
<p id="TMEP-ch-1600-6d125e6619"> However, where the registered mark is currently used as one of several elements in a composite mark, the decision as to whether to accept the specimen requires consideration of whether the registered mark makes an impression apart from the other elements of the composite mark. If the display of the composite is such that the essence of the registered mark makes a separate impression, then the specimen may be sufficient for purposes of the §71 requirement. In many cases, word elements are severable from design elements, because words tend to dominate in forming a commercial impression.  <i>See</i>
<i>In re DeWitt Int’l Corp.</i> , 21 USPQ2d 1620 (Comm’r Pats. 1991). If the mark, as used on the §71 specimen, creates a separate impression apart from any other material on the specimen, then the specimen may be accepted as evidence of current use of the registered mark.
