                           mutants, hybrids, and newly found seedlings, other than a tuber propagated plant or a

                           otherwise provided.

                     </div>
                     <p id="d0e161307">Asexually propagated plants are those
                        that are reproduced by means other than from seeds, such as by the rooting of cuttings, by
                        layering, budding, grafting, inarching, etc. Plants capable of sexual reproduction are not
                        excluded from consideration if they have also been asexually reproduced.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e161310">With reference to tuber propagated
                        plants, for which a plant patent cannot be obtained, the term “tuber” is used in its narrow
                        horticultural sense as meaning a short, thickened portion of an underground branch. Such
                        plants covered by the term “tuber propagated” are the Irish potato and the Jerusalem
                        artichoke. This exception is made because this group alone, among asexually reproduced
                        plants, is propagated by the same part of the plant that is sold as food.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e161313">The term “plant” has been interpreted
                        to mean “plant” in the ordinary and accepted sense and not in the strict scientific sense
                        and thus excludes bacteria. <i> In re Arzberger,</i> 112&nbsp;F. 2d
                        834, 46 USPQ 32 (CCPA 1940). The term “plant” thus does not include asexual propagating
                        material, <i>per se.</i><i>Ex parte Hibberd,</i> 227&nbsp;USPQ 443, 447 (Bd. Pat. App.

                        amendment to the pre-existing patent statute with the Plant Patent Act of 1930. As enacted,
                        the “invents or discovers” requirement limited patent protection to plants “that were
                        created as a result of plant breeding or other agricultural and horticultural efforts and
                        that were created by the inventor.” <i>In re Beineke,</i> 690 F.3d 1344, 1352,
                        103 USPQ2d 1872, 1877 (Fed. Cir. 2012). The plant patent provisions were separated from the
                        utility patent provisions in the Patent Act of 1952 to create <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e304416">35 U.S.C. 161</a></b>.

                        amended in 1954 to extend protection to “newly found seedlings,” provided they were found
                        in a cultivated state, but did not otherwise alter the scope of plant patent protection.

                        the Federal Circuit held that two century-old oak trees found on the lawn of a home were

                        created from inception by human activity and created by the inventor (i.e., the patent
                        applicant) as required by the 1930 Act, nor were they “newly found seedlings” under the
                        1954 amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 1348, 1352, 103 USPQ2d at 1875, 1879.

                        Act, the Supreme Court explained: 
                     </p>
                     <blockquote id="">Prior to 1930, two factors were thought to remove plants from patent
                        protection. The first was the belief that plants, even those artificially bred, were
                        products of nature for purposes of the patent law…. The second obstacle to patent
                        protection for plants was the fact that plants were thought not amenable to the “written
                        description” requirement of the patent law. See U.S.C. § 112. 
                        <p class="excludedText"> ***** 
                           
                        </p> In enacting the Plant Patent Act, Congress addressed
                        both of these concerns. It explained at length its belief that the work of the plant
                        breeder “in aid of nature” was patentable invention. S. Rep. No. 315, 71st Cong., 2d Sess.,
                        6-8 (1930); H.R. Rep. No. 1129, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., 7-9 (1930). And it relaxed the
                        written description requirement in favor of “a description … as complete as is reasonably
                        possible.” 35 U.S.C. § 162.
