                              invalid. A patentee, whether of the whole or any sectional interest therein,
                              may, on payment of the fee required by law, make disclaimer of any complete
                              claim, stating therein the extent of his interest in such patent. Such
                              disclaimer shall be in writing and recorded in the Patent and Trademark Office,
                              and it shall thereafter be considered as part of the original patent to the

                              him.

                        are two types of disclaimers: a statutory disclaimer and a terminal disclaimer. The owner
                        of a patent or an application is the original inventor(s) who has/have not assigned away
                        their rights or the assignee(s) of the original inventor(s), or a combination of the two.
                        The patent or application is assigned by one assignment or by multiple assignments which
                        establish a chain of title from the inventor(s) to the assignee(s).

                           claims of his or her patent. This may result from a lawsuit or because he or she has
                           reason to believe that the claim or claims are too broad or otherwise invalid. If the
                           patent is involved in an interference or contested case, see <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e358373">37 CFR

                        <p id="d0e147206">As noted above, a statutory
                           disclaimer is a statement in which a patent owner relinquishes legal rights to one or
                           more claims of a patent. A statutory disclaimer is not, however, a vehicle for adding or
                           amending claims, because there is no provision for such in the statute
                           (<b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305379">35 U.S.C. 253</a></b>) nor the rules (<b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e326459">37 CFR 1.321</a></b>).
                           Thus, claims of a patent cannot be disclaimed in favor of new claims to be added to the
                           patent or an amendment to existing claims.

                              individual claims would not be appropriate because the claims of a pending

                              reissue (<b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C. 251</a></b>) is well

                              to withdraw or otherwise nullify the effect of a terminal disclaimer recorded in an
                              issued patent. First, the reissue statute only authorizes the Director of the USPTO
                              to reissue a patent “for the unexpired part of the term of the original patent.”
                              Because the&nbsp;granting of a reissue patent without the effect of&nbsp;a&nbsp;recorded terminal
                              disclaimer would result in extending the term of the original patent, reissue under
                              these circumstances would be contrary to the statute. In <i>In re
                                 Yamazaki</i>, 702 F.3d 1327, 1332, 104 USPQ2d 2024, 2028 (Fed. Cir, 2012),
                              the Federal Circuit stated, as to a terminal disclaimer submitted for a patent, that
                              the statutory patent term calculation begins but does not end with 35 U.S.C. 154(a).
                              When a patent issues subject to a terminal disclaimer, the patentee has reduced the
                              patent’s statutory term by effectively eliminating the disclaimed portion from the
                              original patent, by operation of 35 U.S.C. 253 (which indicates that a disclaimer of
                              patent claims “shall thereafter be considered as part of the original patent” and
                              such applies to disclaimers of patent term). <i>Id</i>.

                           <p id="ch1400_d20028_126ef_2ba"> Second, the
                              principle against recapturing previously patented subject matter that has been
                              intentionally dedicated to the public dates back to <i>Leggett
                                 v. Avery</i>, 101 U.S. 256 (1879). The attempt to restore that portion of
                              the patent term that was dedicated to the public to secure the grant of the original
                              patent would be contrary to this recapture principle. Finally, applicants have the
                              opportunity to challenge the need for a terminal disclaimer during the prosecution of
                              the application that issues as a patent. “Reissue is not a substitute for Patent
                              Office appeal procedures.” <i>Ball Corp. v. United

                              applicants did not challenge the propriety of the examiner’s nonstatutory double
                              patenting rejection, but filed a terminal disclaimer to avoid the rejection, the
                              filing of the terminal disclaimer did not constitute error within the meaning of
