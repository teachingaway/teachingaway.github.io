                              applications is available through the Patent Application Information Retrieval (PAIR)
                              system. There is both a public and private interface to PAIR. In public PAIR,
                              information is available relating to issued patents, published patent applications,
                              and applications to which a patented or published application claims domestic
                              priority. In private PAIR, an applicant (or his or her registered patent attorney or
                              registered patent agent) can securely track the progress of his or her application(s)
                              through the USPTO. Private PAIR makes available information relating to unpublished
                              patent applications, but the applicant must associate a Customer Number with the
                              application to obtain access. See MPEP § 403 for Customer Number practice.

                              information regarding an application should check the PAIR system on the Office Web
                              site at http://www.uspto.gov/ebc. Alternatively, the requester may contact the File
                              Information Unit (see MPEP § 1730). The File Information Unit (FIU) will check the
                              relevant Office records and will inform the requester whether the application has
                              been published or has issued as a patent. If the application has been published, the
                              FIU will inform the requester of the publication number and publication date, and if
                              the application has issued as a patent, the FIU will inform the requester of the
                              patent number, issue date and classification. If the application has not been
                              published, but is pending or abandoned then the FIU determines whether the requester
                              is entitled to such information. See MPEP § 102 for additional
                              information.

                              the Office. However, in the event that a six month period has elapsed, and no
