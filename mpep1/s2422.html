                              unbranched sequence of four or more amino acids or an unbranched sequence of
                              ten or more nucleotides. Branched sequences are specifically excluded from this
                              definition. Sequences with fewer than four specifically defined nucleotides or
                              amino acids are specifically excluded from this section. “Specifically defined”
                              means those amino acids other than “Xaa” and those nucleotide bases other than

                                    identifiers shall begin with 1 and increase sequentially by integers. If
                                    no sequence is present for a sequence identifier, the code “000” shall be

                           the use of the terms “peptide or protein” implies, however, that the amino acids in a

                           amino acid sequence is not excluded from the scope of the rules merely due to the
                           presence of a single non-peptidyl bond. If an amino acid sequence can be represented by
                           a string of amino acid abbreviations, with reference, where necessary, to a features
                           table to explain modifications in the sequence, the sequence comes within the scope of
                           the rules. However, the rules are not intended to encompass the subject matter that is

                           conformance requirement of this section may be relaxed for drawing figures. This is
                           especially true in view of the fact that the representation of double stranded
                           nucleotides is not permitted in the “Sequence Listing” and many significant nucleotide
                           features, such as “sticky ends” and the like, will only be shown effectively by
                           reference to a drawing figure. Further, the similarity or homology between/among
                           sequences can only be depicted in an effective manner in a drawing figure. Similarly,
                           drawing figures are recommended for use with amino acid sequences to&nbsp;depict structural
                           features of the corresponding protein, such as finger regions and Kringle regions. The
                           situations discussed herein are given by way of example only and there may be many other
                           reasons for relaxing the requirements of this section for the drawing figures. It should
                           be noted, though, that when a sequence is presented in a drawing, regardless of the
                           format or the manner of presentation of that sequence in the drawing, the sequence must
                           still be included in the Sequence Listing and the sequence identifier (“SEQ ID NO:X”)
                           must be used, either in the drawing or in the Brief Description of the Drawings.

                           inter alia, the purpose of assessing the prior art. It is therefore essential that all

                           database. In those instances in which prior art sequences are only referred to in a
                           given application by name and a publication or accession reference, they need not be
                           included as part of the “Sequence Listing,” unless an examiner considers the referred-

                           However, if the applicant presents the sequence as a string of particular bases or amino

                           whether the applicant considers the sequence to be prior art. In general, any sequence
                           that is disclosed and/or claimed as a sequence, i.e., as a string of particular bases or
                           amino acids, and that otherwise meets the criteria of <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333653">37 CFR

                        <p id="d0e245282">It is generally acceptable to
                           present a single, general sequence in accordance with the sequence rules and to discuss
                           and/or claim variants of that general sequence without presenting each variant as a
                           separate sequence in the “Sequence Listing.” By way of example only, the following types
                           of sequence disclosures would be treated as noted herein by the Office. With respect to
                           “conservatively modified variants thereof” of a sequence, the sequences may be described
                           as SEQ ID NO:X and “conservatively modified variants thereof,” if desired. With respect
                           to a sequence that “may be deleted at the C-terminus by 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 residues,” all
                           of the implied variations do not need to be included in the “Sequence Listing.” If such
                           a situation were encompassed by the rules, it would introduce far too much complexity
                           into the “Sequence Listing” and the Office's database. The possible mathematical

                           “Sequence Listing” that would be thousands of pages in length. In this latter example,
                           only the undeleted sequence needs to be included in the “Sequence Listing,” and the
                           sequences may be described as SEQ ID NO:X from which deletions have been made at the
                           C-terminus by 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 residues. The Office's database will only contain the

                           and/or claim parts or fragments of a properly presented sequence. For example, language
                           such as “residues 14 to 243 of SEQ ID NO:23” is permissible and the fragment need not be
                           separately presented in the “Sequence Listing.” Where a sequence is embedded in the text

                           of another application. In that situation, an applicant may make reference to the other

                           not be required in derivative or continuing applications if the sequence information is

                           previously filed application in which a complying computer readable form had been filed.
                           If sequence information is deleted from or added to that submitted in a previously filed

                           use of the previously filed sequence information. The letter must completely identify

                           indicating whether it was the only computer readable form filed in that application or

                           number, if available. The labeling requirements of <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e318327">37 CFR 1.52(e) </a></b>and

                           papers without contact or compression of the magnetic media which may cause the disk or
                           tape to be unreadable. In no situations should additional or complimentary electronic
                           copies be delivered to examiners or other Office personnel.
