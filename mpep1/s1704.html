                     <p id="d0e163084">The PALM (Patent Application Locating
                        and Monitoring) System is the automated data management system used by the United States
                        Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for the retrieval and/or online updating of the
                        computer record of each patent application. The PALM System also maintains examiner time,
                        activity, and docket records, and technical support staff backlog records.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163095">Information retrieval from PALM is by
                        means of the PALM intranet. Transactions are entered via bar code readers, by keyed
                        entries, or by making an appropriate choice in a drop down menu. Among other items,
                        classification, examiner docket, attorney, inventor, status, and prosecution history data
                        as well as the location of each paper application can be retrieved and updated online with
                        PALM.

                        <p id="d0e163102">The recording of changes to examiner
                           dockets is accomplished by PALM simultaneously with the recording of incoming and
                           outgoing communications, transfers of applications to and from dockets, and other types
                           of updating of the application record. The status of each examiner’s docket can be
                           determined by means of the PALM intranet and is supplemented by periodic printed or
                           electronic reports. Docket reports that are generated by PALM include the individual
                           examiner new and amended docket which lists applications as regular, special, or
                           accelerated applications in priority order; the individual examiner rejected application
                           docket; the individual examiner new application profile, which lists the totals of new
                           applications in each docket, sorted by month of filing; and various summaries of the
                           above reports at the art unit, Technology Center (TC), and corps levels.

                        <p id="d0e163115">All reporting of examiner time and
                           activity is on a biweekly basis. Each examiner’s examining and non-examining time, as
                           entered in the Web Time and Attendance System is used by PALM in the computation of
                           productivity data. The biweekly reports produced include the individual Biweekly
                           Examiner Time and Activity Report which lists, by application number, all applications
                           for which actions have been counted during the biweekly period. The type of action
                           counted for each application is also indicated on the report. This report also includes
                           examiner time data, an action summary, and cumulative summaries to date for the current
                           quarter and fiscal year. Various summary reports at the Art Unit, TC, and Corps levels
                           are also produced.
