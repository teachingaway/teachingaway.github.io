                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e248580"> The method of payment for the
                        maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge is set forth in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316783">37 CFR
                              1.23</a></b>. The payment shall be made in U.S. dollars and in the form of a
                        cashier’s or certified check, Treasury note, national bank notes, or United States Postal
                        Service money order as provided in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316783">37 CFR 1.23(a)</a></b>. If the maintenance fee
                        and any necessary surcharge is sent in any other form, the Office may delay or cancel the
                        credit until collection is made. For example, a personal or other uncertified check drawn
                        on a U.S. bank that is not immediately negotiable, e.g., because it lacks a signature or
                        due to insufficient funds, will not constitute payment of a maintenance fee and/or
                        surcharge. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e248589">The maintenance fee can be charged to a
                        credit card as set forth in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316783">37 CFR 1.23(b)</a></b>, but credit for the
                        payment is subject to actual receipt of the fee by the Office. Credit Card Payment Form
                        (PTO-2038) should be used for payment of fees by credit card unless the payment is
                        submitted over the Internet. If credit card information is provided on a form or document
                        other than the form provided by the Office for the payment of fees by credit card, the
                        Office will not be liable if the credit card number becomes public knowledge. See
                        <b><a href="s509.html#d0e30377">MPEP §
                              509</a></b>.

                        must be payable and immediately negotiable in the United States for the full amount of the

                              1.366(b)</a></b> provides that maintenance fees and any necessary surcharge
                        may be paid by authorization to charge a deposit account established pursuant to
                        <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316815">37
                              CFR 1.25</a></b>. The authorization to charge the deposit account must be
                        submitted within an appropriate window or grace period and must be limited to maintenance
                        fees and surcharges payable on the date of submission. The authorization to charge the
                        deposit account cannot be submitted prior to the third, seventh, or eleventh year after
                        grant of the patent. If an authorization to charge a deposit account were submitted to pay
                        the maintenance fee due at 3 years and 6 months after grant, a new authorization to charge
                        a deposit account or other form of payment will have to be submitted at the appropriate
                        time for each of the maintenance fees due at 7 years and 6 months and 11 years and 6
                        months. Any payment or authorization filed at any time other than that set forth in
                        <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e326870">37
                              CFR 1.362(d), (e), or (f)</a></b> will not serve as a payment of the
                        maintenance fee, except insofar as a delayed payment of the maintenance fee is accepted by
                        the Commissioner pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e327126">37 CFR 1.378</a></b>. See <b><a href="s2590.html#d0e249289">MPEP §
                              2590</a></b>. A payment of less than the required amount, a payment in a
                        manner other than that set forth in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316783">37 CFR 1.23</a></b>, or the filing of an
                        authorization to charge a deposit account having insufficient funds, will not constitute
                        payment of a maintenance fee on a patent. The authorization is required to permit the
                        immediate charging of the maintenance fee to the deposit account. An authorization would be
                        improper if it only authorized the maintenance fee to be charged at a later date, e.g., on
                        the last possible day of payment without surcharge. Such an authorization would not serve
                        as payment of the maintenance fee. Any payment which fails to result in the entire proper
                        amount of the maintenance fee being present on the due date will not constitute payment of
                        the maintenance fee.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e248625">Maintenance fee payments and any
                        surcharges relating thereto must be submitted separately from any other payments for fees
                        or charges, whether submitted in the manner set forth in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316783">37 CFR
                              1.23</a></b> or by authorization to charge a deposit account.

                              37 CFR 1.366(e)</a></b>. Maintenance fee payments and surcharge payments
                        relating thereto that are commingled with payments for other fees or charges, e.g.,
                        application filing fees, issue fees, document supply fees, etc., will not be accepted.
                        Maintenance fees require processing by a separate area of the Office and are not processed
                        in the same manner as other fees and charges. Maintenance fees for a number of patents can
                        be submitted together in one submission and one payment. <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e327022">37 CFR
                              1.366(e)</a></b> specifies that if maintenance fee payments for more than one
                        patent are submitted together, they should be submitted on as few sheets as possible,
                        listing the patent numbers in increasing patent number order. If the payment submitted is
                        insufficient to cover the maintenance fees and any surcharges for all the listed patents,
                        the payment will be applied in the order the patents are listed. In such a circumstance the
                        maintenance fee and any surcharge for one or more of the last listed patents will not be
                        paid.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e248637">Money orders and checks must be made
                        payable to the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. (Checks made
                        payable to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks will continue to be accepted. See
