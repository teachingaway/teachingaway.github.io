                              claims to be partially inoperative by reason of claiming less than the applicant had
                              a right to claim. Accordingly, this is not correctable by reissue of the original

                              for lack of defect in the original patent and lack of error in obtaining the original
                              patent. Compare with <i>In re Doyle,</i> 293 F.3d 1355,
                              63 USPQ2d 1161 (Fed. Cir. 2002) where the court permitted the patentee to file a

                              read on or link the invention elected (and patented) together with the invention not
                              elected. The non-elected invention(s) were inadvertently not filed as a divisional

                                    omitted in the reissue claims. This omission provides a broadening aspect in
                                    the reissue claims, as compared to the claims of the patent. If the omitted
                                    limitation A was argued in the original application to make the application
                                    claims allowable over the art in the application, then the omitted limitation
                                    relates to subject matter previously surrendered in the original application,
                                    and recapture will exist. Accordingly, where claims are broadened in a reissue
                                    application, the examiner should review the prosecution history of the original
                                    patent file for recapture, <span class="Underline">even where the claims

                                    objection made in the application. Even though applicant made no argument on

                                       action, applicant adds limitation D to A+B+C in the claims, but makes no
                                       argument as to that addition. The examiner then allows the claims. Even
                                       though there is no argument as to the addition of limitation D, it must be
                                       presumed that the D limitation was added to obviate the rejection. The

                                 recapture. See <i>Youman,</i> 679 F.3d at 1346 n.4, 102 USPQ2d at 1870

                                 It is to be noted that if the portion of the modified limitation is well known in
                                 the prior art, then impermissible recapture exists, even in a case where a further
                                 limitation which is not related to the surrendered subject matter (i.e., a
                                 limitation that does not materially narrow the claims) has been added to define
                                 the claims over the art. <i>Id.</i></p>

                                 In other words, even if the modified limitation does not materially narrow, the
                                 reissue applicant may have added a new limitation that still relates to
                                 surrendered subject matter. The material narrowing must relate to what was argued

                                       art rejection to add element C and thus provide the combination ABC (after
                                       which the patent issued). A reissue application is then filed, and the
                                       reissue application claims are directed to the combination ABC<sub>broadened</sub>. The ABC<sub>broadened</sub> claims are narrowed in scope when
                                       compared with the canceled claim subject matter AB, because of the addition

                                       can be made even though ABC<sub>broadened</sub>
                                       is narrower than canceled claim subject matter AB , but only if
                                       C<sub>broadened</sub> was “well known in the prior art”. See

                                       the added limitation such that it is broader than the patented claim yet
                                       still materially narrows relative to the original claim, the recapture rule

                                 present in the application for patent. The record of the application for the patent shows that

                                 previously surrendered during the prosecution of the application. Accordingly, the narrow
                                 scope of the claims in the patent was not an error within the meaning of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C. 251</a></b>, and the

                              claim which enlarges the scope of the claims of the patent, <i>i.e.</i>, a claim which is greater in scope than each and every claim of
                              the original patent. If a disclaimer is filed in the patent prior to the filing of a
                              reissue application, the disclaimed claims are <span class="Underline">not</span> part of the “original patent” under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C.

                                 v. TNWK Corp.,</i> 162 F.3d 1379, 1383, 49 USPQ2d 1144, 1147 (Fed. Cir.
                              1998) held that a reissue application violated the statutory prohibition under
                              <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C. 251</a></b> against broadening the scope of the patent more
                              than 2 years after its grant because the reissue claims are broader than the claims
                              that remain after the disclaimer, even though the reissue claims are narrower than
                              the claims that were disclaimed by the patentee before reissue. The reissue
                              application was bounded by the claims remaining in the patent after a disclaimer is
                              filed. A claim of a reissue application enlarges the scope of the claims of the
                              patent if it is broader in <i>at least one </i>respect,
                              even though it may be narrower in other respects. See, e.g., 37 CFR 1.175(b). A claim
                              in the reissue application which includes subject matter not covered by the patent
                              claims enlarges the scope of the patent claims. For example, if any amended or newly
                              added claim in the reissue contains within its scope any conceivable product or
                              process which would not have infringed the patent, then that reissue claim would be
                              broader than the patent claims. <i>Tillotson, Ltd. v. Walbro
                                 Corp.,</i> 831 F.2d 1033, 1037 n.2, 4&nbsp;USPQ2d 1450, 1453 n.2 (Fed. Cir.
                              1987); <i>In re Ruth,</i> 278 F.2d 729, 730, 126 USPQ
                              155, 156 (CCPA 1960); <i>In re Rogoff,</i> 261 F.2d 601,
                              603, 120 USPQ 185, 186 (CCPA 1958). A claim which covers something that the original
                              claims do not is a broadened claim. A claim would be considered a broadening claim if
                              the patent owner would be able to sue any party for infringement who previously could
                              not have been sued for infringement. Thus, where the original patent claims only the
                              process, and the reissue application newly adds product claims, the scope of the
                              claims has been broadened because a party could not necessarily be sued for
                              infringement of the product based on the claims of the original patent (if it were
                              made by a different process).

                              claims in a reissue application where only subcombination claims were present in the
                              original patent could be a broadening of the invention. The question which must be
                              resolved in this case is whether the combination claims added in the reissue would be
                              for “the invention as claimed” in the original patent. See <i>Ex parte Wikdahl</i>, 10 USPQ2d at 1549. The newly added combination claims
                              should be analyzed to determine whether they contain every limitation of the
                              subcombination of any claim of the original patent. If the combination claims (added
                              in the reissue) contain every limitation of the subcombination (which was claimed in
                              the original application), then infringement of the combination must also result in
                              infringement of the subcombination. Accordingly, the patent owner <b id="d0e137887">could not</b>, if a reissue patent issues with the combination
                              claims, <b id="d0e137890">sue any new party</b> for infringement who could
                              not have been sued for infringement of the original patent. Therefore, <b id="d0e137893">broadening does not exist</b>, in spite of the addition of the
                              combination. However, filing a reissue application to merely add combination claim(s)
                              that require all the limitations of a subcombination claim, which subcombination
                              claim was present in the original patent, would not provide an error that is
                              correctable by reissue as defined by <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C. 251</a></b>;

                              corollary of this is that a claim which has been <i>broadened

                              broadened via the reissue (other than the addition of a process step to convert an
                              intermediate to a final product), but independent claim 1 on which it is based is not
                              broadened. Because a dependent claim is construed to contain all the limitations of
                              the claim upon which it depends, claim 2 must be at least as narrow as claim 1 and is
                              thus not a broadened reissue claim.

                           </h2>
                           <p id="d0e137961">A broadened claim can be
                              presented within two years from the grant of the original patent in a reissue
                              application. In addition, a broadened claim can be presented <i>after</i> two years from the grant of the original patent
                              in a broadening reissue application which was filed <i>within</i> two years from the grant. Where any intent to broaden is
                              unequivocally indicated in the reissue application within the two years from the
                              patent grant, a broadened claim can subsequently be presented in the reissue after
                              the two year period. (Note: A statement that “the patent is wholly or partly
                              inoperative by reason of claiming more or less than applicant had a right to claim”
                              is NOT an unequivocal statement of an intent to broaden.) Thus, a broadened claim may
                              be presented in a reissue application after the two years, even though the broadened
                              claim presented after the two years is different than the broadened claim presented
                              within the two years. Finally, if intent to broaden is indicated in a parent reissue
                              application within the two years, a broadened claim can be presented in a continuing
                              (continuation or divisional) reissue application after the two year period. See
                              <i>In re Staats,</i> 671 F.3d 1350, 101 USPQ2d 1930 (Fed. Cir. 2012)
                              which dealt with a continuation of a first reissue application in which the first
                              reissue application was filed within two years of the patent grant. The broadened
                              claims in the continuation reissue application were to an embodiment “alternative”
                              to, and “unrelated” to, the broadened claims of the first reissue application that
                              were filed within the 2-year limit. Notice of broadening was found to be sufficient
                              in this instance, with the court holding that there is no basis for requiring the
                              later broadened claims in the continuation reissue application to be related to, or
                              directed to the same embodiment as in the first reissue
                              application.<i>Id.</i> at 1355, 101 USPQ2d at 1934. “[A]fter a
                              broadening reissue application has been filed within the two year statutory period,
                              an applicant is ‘not barred from making further broadening changes’ after the two
                              year period” regardless of whether the further broadening changes are unrelated to
                              the prior broadening reissue application. <i>Id.</i> A reissue
                              application filed on the 2-year anniversary date from the patent grant is considered
                              to be filed within 2 years of the patent grant. See <i>Switzer
