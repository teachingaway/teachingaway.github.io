                                       nonprovisional application. Conversion of a provisional application to
                                       a nonprovisional application under this paragraph will result in the

                              a typed correspondence address. Additionally, applicants will often specify the
                              correspondence address in more than one paper that is filed with an application, and
                              the address given in the different places sometimes conflicts. Where the applicant

                              (C) oath or declaration (unless power of attorney is more current); and (D) power of
                              attorney. Accordingly, if the ADS includes a typed correspondence address, and the
                              declaration gives a different address (i.e., the address associated with a Customer
                              Number) as the correspondence address, the Office will use the typed correspondence
                              address as included on the ADS. In the experience of the Office, the ADS is the most

                                 PTO/AIA/14 provides an assignee information section, which includes the name
                                 (either person or juristic entity) and address of the assignee of the entire
                                 right, title, and interest in an application. The inclusion of this information in
                                 the application data sheet does not substitute for compliance with any requirement
                                 of 37 CFR part 3 to have an assignment recorded by the Office. Providing assignee
                                 information in the application data sheet is considered a request to include such
                                 information on the patent application publication, since there is no other reason
                                 for including such information in the application data sheet. Assignment
                                 information must be recorded to have legal effect. Assignees who are the applicant
                                 will appear on the patent application publication as the applicant and only need
                                 to separately provide assignee information in the assignee information section if
                                 identification as an assignee is also desired on the patent application
                                 publication.
