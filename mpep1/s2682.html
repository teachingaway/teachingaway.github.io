                                 the patent during the reexamination, or claim 10 is a patent claim that was

                                 claims 10 and 11 were rejected prior to the appeal, then the patent owner was
                                 never put on notice that claim 11 could be made allowable by placing it in
                                 independent form. Thus, where the Board affirms a rejection against claim 10 but
                                 reverses the rejections against dependent claim 11, the examiner should convert
                                 dependent claim 11 into independent form by formal examiner’s amendment and cancel
                                 claim 10 (for which the rejection was affirmed) in the NIRC. In this instance, the
                                 examiner could also set a time period of one month or 30 days (whichever is
                                 longer) in which the patent owner may rewrite dependent claim 11 in independent
                                 form. Extensions of time under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e335528">37 CFR 1.956</a></b>
