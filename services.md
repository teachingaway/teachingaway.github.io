## Corporate Counsel

Our corporate practice counsels companies and funds. Corporate counsel is fundamentally about managing principal-agent problems where multiple stakeholders have overlapping interests. Governance, incentive structures, moral hazard, and regulatory risk are all part of the equation. We help clients chart a course through this thicket, avoiding risks and seizing opportunities along the way.

We run small and medium enterprise mergers and acquisitions processes efficiently to close deals quickly without  sacrificing risk control.


## Raising Capital & Equity Compensation

We are at the forefront of innovative debt and equity financing, including convertible debt with deferred pricing, crowd-sourced and P2P lending networks, standardized convertible preferred stock terms, and contractual profit-sharing rights.

We craft equity incentive plans that attract skilled employees in competitive fields.

## Intellectual Property

We litigate IP disputes, secure patents, and counsel clients on trademark, copyright, and technology licensing issues.

### Patents: <em>Defending Research & Development</em>

Our patent practice combines rigorous data analytics with deep patent law experience. We use modern, data-driven models to help clients develop robust, cost-effect patent portfolios. Patent data from <a href="https://judicialstats.com/index.php/patent-examiners">Judicial Stats</a> helps us craft patent applications that are more likely to sail through the Patent Office and return valuable patent rights. 

A carefully structured portfolio helps create lucrative licensing opportunities, venture capital strategies, and powerful tools for disposing with baseless lawsuits.

### Trademarks: <em>Brand Protection</em>

From identity development, to trademark registration and enforcement, our attorneys work side-by-side with clients to maximize brand value. We understand the fluid nature of branding for the internet, and we help direct  direct clients toward unique and easily defensible identities.

### Copyright: <em>Defending Creative Works</em><

Copyright law helps creative professionals and software developers protect their art and code. We write <a href="http://www.copyrightcodex.com/">Copyright Codex</a>, a free treatise on copyright law that has been recognized by law schools like Standford and Duke. 
        
## Litigation

We litigate complex contract and intellectual property disputes. We defend technology companies from patent trolls. We also help enforce legitimate IP rights, even against larger, better-funded competitors. We contain litigation costs through efficient discovery technology. 

We have successfully handled disputes including trade secret claims, winning trademark appeals at the USPTO, and contract and copyright disputes in federal court.
