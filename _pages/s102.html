                        application number and filing date of any applications claiming the benefit of the filing
                        date of the identified application. The requester should be informed of the national
                        applications listed in the “child” section of the screen. If the child application is not
                        shown to have been patented , PALM Intranet should be used to determine whether the
                        application is pending or abandoned. Alternatively, PALM Intranet may be used with the
                        patent number for continuity data for the patent. Other information contained on the
                        screen, such as whether the application is a Continuation-in-Part (CIP), continuation or
                        divisional application, the date of abandonment of the application, and the issue date, may
                        be confidential information and should not be communicated. As to the extent of the chain
                        of applications for which status information is available, the rule applies only to
                        subsequent and not prior applications.

                        the national stage application as well as any application claiming the benefit of the
                        filing date of the published international application. A copy of the first page of the
                        published international application or of the corresponding page of the PCT Gazette must be
                        supplied with the status request. The status request should be made in writing to the

                        of a published international application may be directed to the PCT Help desk. Only the
                        serial number and filing date, or application number, as well as whether the application is
                        pending, abandoned, or patented may be given for the national stage application and for any
                        applications claiming the benefit of the filing date of the referenced published
                        international application. Other information contained on the continuity data screen, such
                        as whether the application is a CIP, continuation or divisional application, the date of
