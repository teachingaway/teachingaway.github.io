                           copyright and design patent statutes where the author/inventor can secure both a
                           copyright and a design patent. Thus an ornamental design may be copyrighted as a work of
                           art and may also be subject matter of a design patent. The author/inventor may not be
                           required to elect between securing a copyright or a design patent. See <i>In re Yardley</i>, 493 F.2d 1389, 181 USPQ 331. In <i>Mazer</i><i>v.</i><i>Stein</i>, 347 U.S. 201, 100 USPQ 325 (1954), the
