                              Human Services or the Secretary of Agriculture rests on the patent owner or its
                              agent, on each attorney or agent who represents the patent owner and on every
                              other individual who is substantively involved on behalf of the patent owner in
                              a patent term extension proceeding. All such individuals who are aware, or
                              become aware, of material information adverse to a determination of entitlement
                              to the extension sought, which has not been previously made of record in the
                              patent term extension proceeding must bring such information to the attention
                              of the Office or the Secretary, as appropriate, in accordance with paragraph
                              (b) of this section, as soon as it is practical to do so after the individual
                              becomes aware of the information. Information is material where there is a
                              substantial likelihood that the Office or the Secretary would consider it
                              important in determinations to be made in the patent term extension
                              proceeding.

                              this section must be accompanied by a copy of each written document which is
                              being disclosed. The disclosure must be made to the Office or the Secretary, as
                              appropriate, unless the disclosure is material to determinations to be made by
                              both the Office and the Secretary, in which case duplicate copies, certified as
                              such, must be filed in the Office and with the Secretary. Disclosures pursuant
                              to this section may be made to the Office or the Secretary, as appropriate,
                              through an attorney or agent having responsibility on behalf of the patent
                              owner or its agent for the patent term extension proceeding or through a patent
                              owner acting on his or her own behalf. Disclosure to such an attorney, agent or
                              patent owner shall satisfy the duty of any other individual. Such an attorney,
                              agent or patent owner has no duty to transmit information which is not material
                              to the determination of entitlement to the extension sought.

                              determined that fraud on the Office or the Secretary was practiced or attempted

                              connection with the patent term extension proceeding. If it is established by

                        attorney or agent.
