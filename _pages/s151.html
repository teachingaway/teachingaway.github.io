                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e4414">The law requires the statement to set
                        forth “the full facts” surrounding the conception and making of the invention. These facts
                        should include those which are unique to that invention. The use of form paragraphs or
                        printed forms which set forth only broad generalized statements of fact is not ordinarily
                        regarded as meeting the requirements of these statutes.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e4417">The word
                        
                        "applicant"
                        
                        
                         in both of these statutes is
                        construed by the Office to mean the inventor or joint inventors in person, or an assignee,
                        obligated assignee, or a person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the
                        matter. Accordingly, in the ordinary situation, the statements must be signed by the
                        inventor or the joint inventors, or an assignee, obligated assignee, or a person who
                        otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter if available. This
                        construction is consistent with the fact that no other person could normally be more
                        knowledgeable of the 
                        "full facts concerning the circumstances under
                        which such invention was made,"
                        
                        
                         (42 U.S.C. 2457) or, “full facts
                        surrounding the making or conception of the invention or discovery” (42 U.S.C. 2182). If a
                        request under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e317930">37
                              CFR 1.48</a></b> for correction of inventorship is granted during pendency of
                        an application in which a property rights statement has been filed, a supplemental
                        statement executed by any added inventor(s) is required and should promptly be filed with
                        Licensing and Review. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e4423">In instances where an applicant does not
                        have firsthand knowledge whether the invention involved work under any contract,
                        subcontract, or arrangement with or for the benefit of the Atomic Energy Commission, or had
                        any relationship to any work under any contract of the National Aeronautics and Space
                        Administration, and includes in his or her statement information of this nature derived
                        from others, his or her statement should identify the source of his or her information.
                        Alternatively, the statement by the applicant could be accompanied by a supplemental
                        declaration or oath, as to the contractual matters, by the assignee or other person, e.g.,
                        an employee thereof, who has the requisite knowledge.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e4426">When an inventor applicant is deceased or
                        legally incapacitated, or where it is shown to the satisfaction of this Office that he or
                        she refuses to furnish a statement or cannot be reached after diligent efforts,
                        declarations or statements under oath setting forth the information required by the
                        statutes may be accepted from an officer or employee of the assignee who has sufficient
                        knowledge of the facts. The offer of such substitute statements should be based on the
                        actual unavailability of or refusal by the applicant, rather than mere inconvenience. Where
                        it is shown that one of the joint inventors is deceased or unavailable, a statement by all
                        of the other inventor(s) may be accepted.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e4429">The following is an acceptable format for
                        statements to DOE or NASA assuming that no government funds or other considerations were
                        involved in the making or conception of the invention. It is important that the information
                        provided in the statement be an accurate reflection of the fact situation at the time the
                        statement is made. While the sample below is in the form of a declaration, a sworn oath is
                        equally acceptable.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e4436">Note that the statement must be in the
                        form of an oath or declaration. Further note that the statement must be signed by
                        <span class="Underline">all</span> the inventors. See also the notice entitled
                        “Statements Filed Under Atomic Energy Act and NASA Act” published in 914 O.G. 1 (Sept. 4,
