                           knowingly jeopardize his or her client’s rights by performing an illegal act. If such

                           administered, then the oath is a valid oath.

                              Wrapper, and because the Office maintains patent applications in an image form, the
                              Office strongly encourages the use of declarations rather than oaths. However, oaths
                              executed by military personnel in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1044(a) and those
                              executed in many states including Alabama, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
                              Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia need not be impressed
                              with a seal. See paragraph B. below for information regarding venue.

                              proof of authority may be required. Depending on the jurisdiction, the seal may be
                              either embossed or rubber stamped. The latter should not be confused with a stamped
                              legend indicating only the date of expiration of the notary’s

                              notary. This may be given either in the venue or in the body of the jurat. Otherwise,

                              confusion. Without supplying at least a unique identifying name the Office may have

                              specific, alphanumeric characters of reasonable length, and should be presented in
                              such a manner that it is clear to application processing personnel what the

                              identifier being used may result in applicants having to resubmit papers that could

                                 When filing an application on paper, if an assignment is submitted for recording
                                 along with the application, the assignment is separated from the paper application
                                 after the application is assigned an application number and is forwarded to the

                                 not become part of the application file. If the applicant indicates that an

                                 assignment into the Image File Wrapper (IFW) file for the application before
                                 forwarding it to the Assignment Recordation Branch.

                                    inventorship in provisional applications. Under 37 CFR 1.41(c), the
                                    inventorship of a provisional application is the inventor or joint inventors
                                    set forth in the cover sheet as prescribed by 37 CFR 1.51(c)(1). Once a cover
                                    sheet is filed in a provisional application, any correction of inventorship
                                    must be pursuant to 37 CFR 1.48. If a cover sheet as prescribed by 37 CFR

                                    papers filed pursuant 37 CFR 1.53(c), unless the applicant files a paper,
                                    including the processing fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(q), supplying the name or

                                    provisional application. 37 CFR 1.48(d) requires that the submission include:
                                    (1) a request, signed by a party set forth in 37 CFR 1.33(b), to correct the

                                    the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(q). For provisional applications, it may not
                                    be necessary to correct the inventorship under 37 CFR 1.48 (d) unless there

                                    in any U.S. nonprovisional or provisional application may in part be dependent

                                       each actual inventor must be presented. While each inventor need not execute
                                       the same oath or declaration, each oath or declaration executed by an
                                       inventor must contain a complete listing of all inventors so as to clearly
                                       indicate what each inventor believes to be the appropriate inventive entity.
                                       Where individual declarations are executed, they must be submitted as
                                       individual declarations rather than combined into one declaration. For
                                       example, where the inventive entity is A and B, a declaration may not be
                                       executed only by A naming only A as the inventor and a different declaration
                                       may not be executed only by B naming only B as the inventor, which two
                                       declarations are then combined into one declaration with a first page of
                                       boiler plate, a second page with A’s signature, and a second page with B’s
                                       signature (so that it appears that the declaration was executed with the
                                       entire inventive entity appearing in the declaration when it did
                                       not).

                                       required. Where an application is filed with an executed declaration under

                                       govern. However, where an executed declaration is never submitted and the

                              force between the United States and 28 foreign countries as parties to the
                              Convention. Subsequently, additional countries have become parties to the Convention.
                              The Convention applies to any document submitted to the United States Patent and

                              notary public in any one of the member countries. The Convention abolishes the
                              certification of the authority of the notary public in a member country by a
                              diplomatic or consular officer of the United States and substitutes certification by
                              a special certificate, or apostille, executed by an officer of the member country.

                              the notary’s authority. The requirement for a diplomatic or consular certificate,

                                    applications filed before September 16, 2012, the order of names of joint
                                    patentees in the heading of the patent is taken from the order in which the
                                    typewritten names appear in the original oath or declaration. Care should
                                    therefore be exercised in selecting the preferred order of the typewritten
                                    names of the joint inventors, before filing, as requests for subsequent
                                    shifting of the names would entail changing numerous records in the Office.
