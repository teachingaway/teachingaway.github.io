                              earlier pending reexamination, then reexamination should be ordered only if the art
                              cited raises a substantial new question of patentability which is different from that
                              raised in the earlier pending reexamination. If the art cited in the subsequent

                              the earlier pending reexamination it is not "new," and therefore, the subsequent
                              request should be denied. Where the request raises a different substantial new
                              question of patentability as to some patent claims, but not as to others, the request
                              would be granted in part; see the order issued in reexamination control number
                              90/007,843 and 90/007,844. If the subsequent request does <b id="d0e253531">not</b> include the art which raised the substantial new question of

                              ordered, depending on whether the different art cited raises a substantial new
                              question of patentability.

                              first (or prior) pending reexamination proceeding. However, in order for the second
                              or subsequent request for reexamination to be granted, the second or subsequent
                              requester must independently provide a substantial new question of patentability

                              based on the claims in effect at the time of the determination (<b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e334979">37 CFR
                                    1.923</a></b>). If a “different” substantial new question of
                              patentability is not provided by the second or subsequent request for the claims in
                              effect at the time of the determination, the second or subsequent request for
                              reexamination must be denied since the Office is only authorized by statute to grant
                              a reexamination proceeding based on a substantial new question of patentability
                              “affecting any claim of the patent.” See <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306666">35 U.S.C.
                                    312(a)</a></b>. Accordingly, there must be at least one substantial new
                              question of patentability established for the existing claims in the patent in order
                              to grant reexamination.

                           <p id="d0e253558">Once the second or subsequent
                              request has provided a “different” substantial new question of patentability based on
                              the claims in effect at the time of the determination, the second or subsequent
                              request for reexamination may also provide information directed to any proposed new
                              or amended claim in the pending reexamination, to permit examination of the entire
                              patent package. The information directed to a proposed new or amended claim in the
                              pending reexamination is addressed during the later filed reexamination (where a
                              substantial new question of patentability is raised in the later filed request for
                              reexamination for the existing claims in the patent), in order to permit examination
                              of the entire patent package. When a proper basis for the second or subsequent
                              request for reexamination is established, it would be a waste of resources to prevent
                              addressing the proposed new or amended claims, by requiring parties to wait until the
                              certificate issues for the proposed new or amended claims, and only then to file a
                              new reexamination request challenging the claims as revised via the certificate. This
                              also prevents a patent owner from simply amending all the claims in some nominal
                              fashion to preclude a subsequent reexamination request during the pendency of the
                              reexamination proceeding.
