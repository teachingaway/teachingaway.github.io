## Corporate Counsel

Our corporate practice counsels companies and funds. Corporate counsel is fundamentally about managing principal-agent problems where multiple stakeholders have overlapping interests. Governance, incentive structures, moral hazard, and regulatory risk are all part of the equation. We help clients chart a course through this thicket, avoiding risks and seizing opportunities along the way.

We run small and medium enterprise mergers and acquisitions processes efficiently to close deals quickly without  sacrificing risk control.


## Raising Capital & Equity Compensation

We are at the forefront of innovative debt and equity financing, including convertible debt with deferred pricing, crowd-sourced and P2P lending networks, standardized convertible preferred stock terms, and contractual profit-sharing rights.

We craft equity incentive plans that attract skilled employees in competitive fields.
