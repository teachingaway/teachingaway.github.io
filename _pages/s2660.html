                           together with the order. For example, the reexamination file may have been provided to
                           the examiner too late to include an Office action together with the order and still meet
                           the deadline of ten weeks from the filing date of the request for mailing the order

                           the order would be prepared and mailed, and the Office action would be mailed at a later
                           date. In addition, a first Office action is not mailed with the order where the files

                                    chlorinated polymers. It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in

                        <p id="d0e257010">Normally, the title of the patent
                           will not need to be changed during reexamination. In those <span class="Underline">very rare</span> instances where a change of the title does become necessary,
                           the examiner should point out the need for the change as early as possible in the
                           prosecution, as a part of an Office action. This will give the patent owner an
                           opportunity to comment on the change prior to the examiner’s formal change in the title
                           via an examiner’s amendment accompanying the Notice of Intent to Issue <i>Inter Partes</i> Reexamination Certificate (NIRC) at the time
                           that the prosecution of the reexamination proceeding is to be terminated. A change in
                           the title in a reexamination can only be effected via a formal examiner’s amendment
                           accompanying the NIRC. Changing the title and merely initialing the change is not
                           permitted in reexamination.

                        <p id="d0e257023">While a change in the title may be
                           commented on by the patent owner, the final decision as to the change is that of the
                           examiner, and the examiner’s decision is not subject to review. Accordingly, where the
                           examiner notes the need for a change at the time of issuing the NIRC, the examiner may
                           make the change at that point, even though the patent owner will not have an opportunity
                           to comment on the change.

                           would be appropriate to change the title is where all the claims directed to one of the
                           categories of invention (in the patent) are canceled via the reexamination proceeding,
                           it would be appropriate to change the title to delete reference to that
                           category.

                           otherwise patentable, and a requirement should be made for rewriting the dependent claim
                           in independent form.
