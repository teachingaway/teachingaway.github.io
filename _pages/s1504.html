                     <p id="d0e152015">In design patent applications,
                        ornamentality, novelty, nonobviousness enablement and definiteness are necessary
                        prerequisites to&nbsp;the grant of a patent. The inventive novelty or unobviousness resides in
                        the ornamental shape or configuration of the article in which the design is embodied or the
                        surface ornamentation which is applied to or embodied in the design.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e152027">Novelty and nonobviousness of a design
                        claim must generally be determined by a search in the pertinent design classes. It is also
                        mandatory that the search be extended to the mechanical classes encompassing inventions of
                        the same general type. Catalogs and trade journals as well as available foreign patent
                        databases are also to be consulted.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e152034">If the examiner determines that the
                        claim of the design patent application does not satisfy the statutory requirements, the
                        examiner will set forth in detail, and may additionally summarize, the basis for all
                        rejections in an Official action. If a reply to an Office action overcomes a rejection
                        either by way of an amendment to the claim or by providing convincing arguments that the
                        rejection should be withdrawn, that rejection must be indicated as withdrawn in the next
                        Office action, unless such action is a notice of allowability. Likewise, any amendment to
                        the specification or claim, or new drawing or drawing correction submitted in reply to an
                        objection or objections in an Office action must be acknowledged in the next Office action,
                        unless such action is a notice of allowability. When an examiner determines that the claim
                        in a design application is patentable under all statutory requirements, but formal matters
                        still need to be addressed and corrected prior to allowance, an <i>Ex parte Quayle</i> action will be sent to applicant indicating allowability of
                        the claim and identifying the necessary corrections.

                                    ornamentality is a matter of concern.  Such evidence may include a showing of a period in the life of the design when the
                                    ornamentality of the article may be a matter of concern to a purchaser during the process of sale.  An example of this type
                                    of evidence is a sample of sales literature such as an advertisement or a catalog sheet which presents the appearance of the
                                    article as ornamental and not merely as a means of identification or instruction; and

                                    is ornamental. This type of evidence should demonstrate “thought of ornament” in the design

                              This logic was reinforced by the CCPA in <i> In re

                           basis of this practice is that if the foreign applicant has received the protection

                                 alters the primary reference that its broad function can no longer be carried out,
                                 the combination of the prior art would not have been obvious to a designer of
                                 ordinary skill in the art. It is permissible to modify the primary reference to
                                 the extent that the specific function of the article may be affected while the
                                 broad function is not affected. For example, a primary reference to a cabinet
                                 design claimed as airtight could be modified to no longer be airtight so long as
                                 its function as a cabinet would not be impaired.

                                 The scope of a claimed design is understood to be limited to those surfaces or

                                 additional written description in the specification. The title does not define the
                                 scope of the claimed design but merely identifies the article in which it is
                                 embodied. See <b><a href="s1503.html#d0e150455">MPEP § 1503.01</a></b>, subsection I. It
                                 is assumed that the claim has been crafted to protect that which the applicant
                                 “regards as his invention.” <i>In re Zahn</i>, 617
                                 F.2d 261, 204 USPQ 988 (CCPA 1980). Therefore, when visible portions of the
                                 article embodying the design are not shown, it is because they form no part of the
                                 claim to be protected. It is <i> prima facie</i>
                                 evidence that the scope of the claimed design is limited to those surfaces “as
                                 shown” in the application drawing(s) in the absence of any additional written
                                 disclosure. See <b><a href="s1503.html#d0e150455">MPEP § 1503.01</a></b>, subsection II.

                                 the reproduction of what is shown in the drawings; it is not necessary that the

                                 the removal of three-dimensional surface treatment that is an integral part of the
                                 configuration of the claimed design, for example, beading, grooves, and ribs. The
                                 underlying configuration revealed by such an amendment would not be apparent in
                                 the application as filed and, therefore, it could not be established that
                                 applicant was in possession of this amended configuration at the time the
                                 application was filed. However, an amendment that changes the scope of a design by
                                 either reducing certain portions of the drawing to broken lines or converting
                                 broken line structure to solid lines is not a change in configuration as defined
                                 by the court in <i>Salmon</i>. The reason for this is
                                 because applicant was in possession of everything disclosed in the drawing at the
                                 time the application was filed and the mere reduction of certain portions to
                                 broken lines or conversion of broken line structure to solid lines is not a
                                 departure from the original disclosure. Examiners are cautioned that if broken
                                 line structure is converted to solid lines by way of amendment, the shape and
                                 configuration of that structure must have been fully disclosed and enabling at the
                                 time the application was filed. An amendment which alters the appearance of the
                                 claimed design by removing two-dimensional, superimposed surface treatment may be
                                 permitted if it is clear from the application that applicant had possession of the
                                 underlying configuration of the design without the surface treatment at the time

                           (as noted in <b><a href="s803.html#d0e98022">MPEP § 803)</a></b> is to design applications

                              multiple designs have overall appearances with basically the same design
                              characteristics; and (B) the differences between the multiple designs are

                              Therefore, in determining the question of patentable distinctness under

                              art may be necessary. Both of the above considerations are important. Differences
                              between the designs may prove to be obvious in view of the prior art, but if the
                              overall appearances are not basically the same, the designs remain patentably
                              distinct. Embodiments claiming different scopes of the same design can be patentably
                              distinct using the two-step analysis above. When an application illustrates a
                              component, which is a subcombination of another embodiment, the subcombination often
                              has a distinct overall appearance and a restriction should be required. When an
                              application illustrates only a portion of the design, which is the subject of another
                              embodiment, that portion often has a distinct overall appearance and a restriction
                              should be required.

                                 descriptions or by way of a descriptive statement in the specification of the
                                 application as filed. For example, the second embodiment of a cabinet discloses a
                                 single view showing only the difference in the front door of the cabinet of the
                                 first embodiment; the figure description should state that this view “is a second
                                 embodiment of Figure 1, the only difference being the configuration of the door,
                                 it being understood that all other surfaces are the same as those of the first
                                 embodiment.” This type of statement in the description is understood to
                                 incorporate the disclosure of the first embodiment to complete the disclosure of
                                 the second embodiment. However, in the absence of such a statement in the
                                 specification of an application as filed, the disclosure of one embodiment will
                                 normally not be permitted to provide antecedent basis for any written or visual

                                 considered to be basically the same, then it must be determined whether the
                                 differences are either minor between the embodiments and not a patentable

                                 since their appearances are patentably distinct. In such case it doesn’t matter

                                 designs are considered to be separate inventions which require separate claims,
                                 and restriction to one or the other is necessary. See <i>In
                                    re Kelly</i>, 200 USPQ 560 (Comm’r Pat. 1978); <i>Ex parte Sanford</i>, 1914 C.D. 69, 204 O.G. 1346 (Comm’r Pat. 1914);

                                 Exam. 1960). In determining whether embodiments of different scope can be retained
                                 in a single application they must have overall appearances that are basically the
                                 same, and the difference in scope must be minor and not a patentable distinction.
                                 That is, they must, by themselves, be considered obvious over each other under 35
                                 U.S.C. 103(a) without the aid of analogous prior art. The reason for this, as
                                 stated above, is because claim protection to the whole design does not extend to
                                 any individual part or portion thereof. Therefore, if the difference in scope
                                 between embodiments has an impact on the overall appearance that distinguishes one
                                 over the other, they must be restricted since the difference in scope creates
                                 patentably distinct designs that must be supported by separate claims. Form

                              obviousness-type double patenting. To establish a <i>prima
                                 facie</i> case of obviousness-type double patenting: (A) the conflicting
                              design claims must have overall appearances with basically the same design
                              characteristics; and (B) the differences between the two designs must be insufficient
                              to patentably distinguish one design from the other. Differences may be considered
                              patentably insufficient when they are <i>de minimis</i>
                              or obvious to a&nbsp;designer of ordinary skill in the art. While the conflicting
                              application or patent (if less than a year older than the application) used to
                              establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of obviousness-type
                              double patenting is not considered “prior art,” the principle involved is the same.

                                 reference in light of the secondary reference is proper because the applied references are
                                 so related that the appearance of features shown in one would suggest the application of
                                 those features to the other. See <i>In re Rosen</i>, 673 F.2d 388, 213 USPQ 347

                                 noted that case law has held that a designer skilled in the art is charged with knowledge of
                                 the related art; therefore, the combination of old elements, herein, would have been well
                                 within the level of ordinary skill. See <i>In re Antle</i>, 444 F.2d 1168,170
