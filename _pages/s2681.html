                              Board, in its decision, may affirm or reverse each decision of the examiner on
                              all issues raised on each appealed claim, or remand the reexamination
                              proceeding to the examiner for further consideration. The reversal of the
                              examiner’s determination not to make a rejection proposed by the third party
                              requester constitutes a decision adverse to the patentability of the claims
                              which are subject to that proposed rejection which will be set forth in the
                              decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board as a new ground of rejection
                              under paragraph (b) of this section. The affirmance of the rejection of a claim
                              on any of the grounds specified constitutes a general affirmance of the
                              decision of the examiner on that claim, except as to any ground specifically
                              reversed.

                              the examiner’s determination not to make a rejection proposed by a requester,
                              the Board shall set forth in the opinion in support of its decision a new
                              ground of rejection; or should the Board have knowledge of any grounds not
                              raised in the appeal for rejecting any pending claim, it may include in its
                              opinion a statement to that effect with its reasons for so holding, which
                              statement shall constitute a new ground of rejection of the claim. Any decision
                              which includes a new ground of rejection pursuant to this paragraph shall not
                              be considered final for judicial review. When the Board makes a new ground of
                              rejection, the owner, within one month from the date of the decision, must
                              exercise one of the following two options with respect to the new ground of
                              rejection to avoid termination of the appeal proceeding as to the rejected
                              claim:

                                    rejected or new evidence relating to the claims so rejected, or

                           Board is committed by statute to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the
                           Board’s decisions are properly reviewable on petition <b id="d0e267045">only to the
                              extent of</b> determining whether they involve a convincing showing of error,
                           abuse of discretion, or policy issue appropriate for higher level determination.
                           Reasonable rulings made by the Board on matters resting in its discretion&nbsp;will not be
                           disturbed upon petition. Thus, for example, the Board’s opinion as to whether it has
                           employed a new ground of rejection will not be set aside on petition unless said opinion
                           is found to be clearly unwarranted.
