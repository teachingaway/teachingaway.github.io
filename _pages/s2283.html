                           decision prior to merging. A suspension will only be granted in extraordinary instances,

                           conducted with special dispatch within the Office.” This statutory provision is grounded
                           on the need for certainty and finality as to the question of patentability raised by the
                           request for reexamination. Thus, if a second request for reexamination will unduly delay
                           the first reexamination proceeding, the two proceedings generally will not be merged. If
                           the Office were to merge the two proceedings, the first reexamination proceeding would
                           need to be withdrawn from its place in the process, thus delaying, instead of advancing,
                           prosecution. This would run contrary to the statutory “special dispatch” requirement of
                           <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306538">35
                                 U.S.C. 305</a></b> and its intent. On the other hand, if the Office does
                           not merge, the first reexamination proceeding can be concluded, and any substantial new
                           question of patentability raised by the second reexamination request can be resolved in
                           the second proceeding, with no delay resulting. The second request is then considered
                           based on the claims in the patent as indicated in the issued reexamination certificate,
                           rather than the original claims of the patent. However, the Office always retains the
                           authority to merge because in some instances, it may be more efficient to merge the two
                           proceedings, which would foster “special dispatch.”The instances where the Office may,
                           or may not, merge an ongoing reexamination proceeding with a subsequent reexamination
                           proceeding, are addressed on a case-by-case basis.
