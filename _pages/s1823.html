                        			Box No. I of the request. <b><a href="mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e366450">PCT Rule 5</a></b> contains detailed
                        			requirements as to the manner and order of the description, which, generally, should be
                        			in six parts. Those parts should have the following headings: “Technical Field,”
                        			“Background Art,” “Disclosure of Invention,” “Brief Description of Drawings,” “Best Mode
                        			for Carrying Out the Invention” or, where appropriate, “Mode(s) for Carrying Out the
                        			Invention,” “Industrial Applicability,” “Sequence Listing,” and “Sequence Listing Free
                        			Text,” where applicable. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e168606">The details required for the
                        			disclosure of the invention so that it can be carried out by a person skilled in the art
                        			depend on the practice of the national Offices. It is therefore recommended that due
                        			account be taken of national practice in the United States of America when the
                        			description is drafted.

                     <p id="d0e168612">This applies likewise to the need to
                        			indicate the “best mode for carrying out the invention.” If at least one of the
                        			designated Offices requires the indication of the best mode (for instance, the United
                        			States Patent and Trademark Office), that best mode must be indicated in the
                        			description.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e168615">A description drafted with due regard
                        			to what is said in these provisions will be accepted by all the designated Offices. It
                        			might require more care than the drafting of a national patent application, but
                        			certainly much less effort than the drafting of multiple applications, which is
                        			necessary where the PCT route is not used for filing in several
                        			countries.
