                           eligibility and any period of extension of the patent. A single request for

                           such time as may be set in the notice of final determination or, if no time is set,
                           within one month from the date of the final determination. The time periods set forth

                        required or inquiry made of applicant before a final determination is made on whether a
                        patent is eligible for extension. In circumstances where further information is required by
                        the Office, the applicant will be given a time period within which to respond. The failure
                        to provide a response within the time period provided may result in a final determination
                        adverse to the granting of an extension of patent term unless the response period is
                        extended. An extension of time to respond may be requested under the provisions of

                        term, if any. This notice shall constitute the final determination as to eligibility and
                        any period of extension of the patent term. If no request for reconsideration is filed
                        within the time period set in the notice of final determination, the certificate of patent
