                           to situations where (A) the inventions are independent or distinct as claimed, and (B)
                           there would be a serious burden on the examiner if restriction is not required (see
                           <b><a href="s803.html#d0e98022">MPEP
                                 §&nbsp;803</a></b>). Potential interferences present an additional
                           situation in which a restriction requirement may be appropriate. Specifically,
                           restriction of interfering claims from non-interfering claims, or from unpatentable
                           claims whose further prosecution would unduly delay initiation of an interference, can
                           be an appropriate use of restrictions under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040">35&nbsp;U.S.C. 121</a></b>. An
                           Interference Practice Specialist (IPS) should be consulted in making and resolving
                           restrictions under this heading. An applicant may, of course, also choose to cancel
                           claims and refile them in a continuation application without waiting for the restriction
                           requirement.

                              definition, is directed to a patentably distinct invention compared to a claim that
                              does interfere. Leaving a non-interfering claim in an application going into an
                              interference creates an unwarranted delay in the issuance of claims to the
                              non-interfering subject matter. As far as the public and the Office are concerned,
                              there is no justification for not issuing the non-interfering claims promptly. An
                              exception exists if the claims are already term limited, as would be the case for an
                              application subject to a terminal disclaimer or a reissue application (see

                              the reasons for the traversal, the restriction may be maintained or the traversal may
                              be treated as a concession that the non-interfering claims should be designated as

                                 to another inventor with a much later earliest effective filing date. Delay of the
                                 interference until the patentability of the broader claims is resolved may unduly
