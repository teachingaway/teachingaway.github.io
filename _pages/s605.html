                              proprietary interest in the matter under 35 U.S.C. 118. If an application under 35
                              U.S.C. 111 is made by a person other than the inventor under 37 CFR 1.46(a), the
                              application must contain an application data sheet under 37 CFR 1.76 specifying in
                              the applicant information section the assignee, the person to whom the inventor is
                              under an obligation to assign the invention, or the person who otherwise shows
                              sufficient proprietary interest in the matter. While identifying the party making the
                              application for patent (the applicant) in an application data sheet is not a filing
                              date requirement, a delay in naming the applicant under 37 CFR 1.46 may cause it to
                              appear that applicant is the inventor and thus requiring the party to file a request
                              under 37 CFR 1.46(c) to become the applicant, which requires compliance with 37 CFR
                              3.71 and 3.73. See MPEP § 325. If an assignee is filing an application under 37 CFR
                              1.46, but the assignee is not the assignee of the entire right, title and interest in
                              the application, then the assignee would need to be named as the applicant under 37
                              CFR 1.46 together with the other party who has an ownership interest. For example, if
                              there are two joint inventors, and one inventor has assigned his rights in the
                              invention to the assignee, but the other inventor has not assigned his rights in the
                              invention and is under no obligation to assign his rights, the assignee and the other
                              inventor should be identified as the applicant in the applicant information section
                              of the application data sheet. See 37 CFR 3.71.
