                        <p id="d0e242556">The sequence rules require the use
                           of standard symbols and a standard format for sequence data in most sequence-type patent
                           applications. They further require the submission of that data in computer readable
                           form. Compliance is required for most disclosures of sequence data in new applications
                           filed on or after October 1, 1990. The revised sequence rules apply to most new
                           applications filed on or after July 1, 1998. See the final rule publications as cited in
                           <b><a href="s2420.html#d0e242518">MPEP

                        <p id="d0e242562">The Office encourages voluntary
                           compliance for applications not subject to the rules, but all aspects of the rules must
                           be complied with before data will be entered into the database. This includes submission
                           of all statements required by the rules. In exceptional circumstances, it should be
                           noted that the Office may waive the rules via a <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e325004">37 CFR 1.183</a></b>

                        <p id="d0e242576">Basically, the sequence rules define
                           a set of symbols and procedures that are both mandatory and the only way that an
                           applicant is permitted to describe information about a sequence that falls within the
                           definitions used in the rules. Thus, <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333653">37 CFR 1.821</a></b>
                           defines a “sequence” and a “Sequence Listing” for the purpose of the rules, the
                           requirements for specific symbols, and formats for the “Sequence Listing,” the
                           requirement for a computer readable form (CRF) of the “Sequence Listing,” and the
                           deadlines for complying with the requirements. <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333753">37 CFR 1.822</a></b> to

                           are mandatory for the presentation of sequence data, and <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e334511">37 CFR
                                 1.825</a></b> sets forth procedures that are available to an applicant in
                           the event that amendments to the sequence information or replacement of the computer
                           readable copy become necessary.

                        <p id="d0e242591">The sequence rules embrace all
                           unbranched nucleotide sequences with ten or more bases and all unbranched, non-D amino
                           acid sequences with four or more amino acids, provided that there are at least 4
                           “specifically defined” nucleotides or amino acids. The rules apply to all sequences in a
                           given application, whether claimed or not. All such sequences are relevant for the
                           purposes of building a comprehensive database and properly assessing prior art. It is
                           therefore essential that all sequences, whether only disclosed or also claimed, be
                           included in the database.

                        <p id="d0e242598">With respect to the Office’s
                           determination of compliance with the sequence rules and the opportunities afforded
                           applicants to satisfy the requirements of the rules, applicants will be notified of
                           easily detectable deficiencies early in the application process. Applicants whose
                           computer readable forms are damaged in the mail, are not readable, or are missing
                           mandatory elements will be notified shortly after receipt of the application by the
                           Office. Applications filed on or after November 29, 2000, will be retained in the Office
                           of Initial Patent Examination (OIPE) until any noncompliant sequence listing that
                           renders an application unsuitable for examination is corrected. Deficiencies of a more
                           sophisticated nature will likely only be detected by the examiner to whom the
                           application is assigned. Applicant will be notified of any errors or inconsistencies
                           detected by the examiner early in the examination process. Other errors or
                           inconsistencies will be noted by the examiner early in the examination process.

                           deficiency, a notice will be sent to the applicant detailing the damage or deficiency
                           and setting at least a 30-day period for reply. The period for reply will usually be 2
                           months when sent during the preexamination processing of an application. However, if the
                           notice is sent out with an Office communication having a longer period for reply, the
                           period for reply may be longer than 2&nbsp;months, e.g., where the notice is sent with an
                           Office action on the merits setting a 3-month period for reply. Extensions of time in
                           which to reply will be available pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323655">37 CFR 1.136</a></b>. When
                           an action by the applicant, such as a reply to a Notice to Comply from the Office, is
                           determined to be a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to comply with
                           the rules and it is apparent that compliance with some requirement has inadvertently
                           been omitted, the applicant may be given a new time period to correct the omission. See

                        <p id="d0e242626">With general regard to the symbols
                           and format to be used for nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data set forth in
                           <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333753">37

                           accommodate progress in the areas of both standardization and computerization as they
                           relate to sequence data by subsequently amending the rules to take into account any such
                           progress. This progress will probably be reflected in the refinement of or
                           liberalization of the rules. For example, progress in the area of the standardization of
                           sequence data will likely result in a more comprehensive rule. For example, the D-amino
                           acids and branched sequences that are currently excluded from the rule may, in the
                           future, be brought within the scope of the rule once the necessary standardization
                           technology becomes available. As a further example, the computer readable form is
                           currently limited to certain forms of electronic media, but it can readily be seen that
                           progress in the technology for developing databases of the type the Office has
                           envisioned will likely permit a broadening of the permissible types of computer readable
                           forms that may be submitted. The same can be said for the computer/operating-system
                           configurations that are currently permitted by the rules. As the Office becomes able to
                           provide greater refinement and liberality in these areas, the Office will do so by the
                           publication of notices in the <i>Official Gazette</i> or
                           formal rulemaking proposals, as appropriate.
