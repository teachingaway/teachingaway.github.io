                           <p id="d0e110448"> On January 2, 2001, the United
                              States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) began printing the World Intellectual
                              Property Organization (WIPO) Standard ST.16 code on each of its published patent
                              documents. WIPO Standard ST.16 codes (kind codes) include a letter, and in many cases
                              a number, used to distinguish the kind of patent document (e.g., publication of an
                              application for a utility patent (patent application publication), utility patent,
                              plant patent application publication, plant patent, or design patent) and the level
                              of publication (e.g., first publication, second publication, or corrected
                              publication). Detailed information on Standard ST.16 and the use of kind codes by
                              patent offices throughout the world is available on the WIPO web site at
                              http://www.wipo.int/scit/en under the links for WIPO standards and other
                              documentation.

                           <p id="d0e110451">In addition, some kind codes
                              assigned to existing USPTO patent documents were changed because, beginning on March
                              15, 2001, patent application publications began to be published weekly on
                              Thursdays.

                              of the kind codes which are no longer being used on certain published patent
                              documents as well as a summary of the kind codes which will be used on published
                              patent documents after January 2, 2001. It is recommended that USPTO documents be
                              identified by the following three elements: (A) the two-character country code (US
                              for United States of America); (B) the patent or publication number; and (C) the WIPO
                              ST.16 kind code. For example, “US&nbsp;7,654,321 B1” for U.S. Patent No. 7,654,321 where
                              there was no previously published patent application publication, and “US
                              2003/1234567 A1” for U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/1234567, in 2003.
                              Each year the numbering of published patent applications will begin again with the
                              new four-digit year and the number 0000001, so the number of a patent application
                              publication must include an associated year.

                              disclosed by a common inventor(s) and patented in more than one country, these
                              patents are called a family of patents. Whenever a family of patents or published
                              patent disclosures existed, the Office selected from a prioritized list of countries
                              a single family member for placement in the examiners’ search file and selected the
                              patent of the country with the earliest patent date. If the U.S. was one of the
                              countries granting a patent in the “family” of patents, none of the foreign
                              “equivalents” was placed in the U.S. search files. See paragraph III., below.
                              However, foreign patents or published patent disclosures within a common family which
                              issued prior to the final highest priority patent (e.g., U.S.) may have been placed
                              in the U.S. paper search files and these copies were generally not removed when the
                              higher priority patent was added to the U.S. search files at a later
                              date.

                              under U.S. patent law a number of different events all occur on the issue date of a

                                 a patent. However, in many countries and in PCT cases, the word application refers
                                 only to the paper, usually a printed form, which is to be “accompanied by” or have
                                 “attached” to it certain other papers, namely a specification, drawings when

                                 applications. In these countries, the publication of the contents of the
                                 application occurs at a certain time, usually 18 months after filing. The
                                 applicant is given certain provisional rights upon publication even though
                                 examination has not been completed or in some cases has not even begun at the time

                                 either of two forms. In the first form, some countries publish a notice giving
                                 certain particulars in their official journal, and thereafter, any one may see the
                                 papers at the patent office or order copies. This procedure is referred to as
                                 “laying open for public inspection.” There is no printed publication of the
                                 specification, although an abstract may be published in printed form. If anyone
                                 can inspect or obtain copies of the laid open application, then it is sufficiently
                                 accessible to the public to constitute a “publication” within the meaning of

                                 inspection of the papers to determine if they are in proper form. Other countries
                                 perform an examination of the merits on the basis of an extensive search of the
                                 prior art, as is done in the U.S. The former are referred to as nonexamining or
                                 registration countries, although some systems allow for a rejection on matters
                                 apparent on the face of the papers, such as matters of form or statutory subject
                                 matter.

                                 patent material and nonpatent publications in their search files. Some countries
                                 specifically limit the search by rule, or lack of facilities, to their own patents
                                 with very little or no additional material. An increasing number of countries are
                                 requiring applicants to give information concerning references cited in

                                 “published” for opposition. Then there is a period, usually 3 or 4 months, within
                                 which members of the public can oppose the grant of the patent. In some countries,
                                 the opposing party can be any person or company. In other countries, only those
                                 parties who are affected by the outcome can participate in the opposition. The

                                 countries publish the granted patent. Where the specifications of granted patents
                                 are issued in printed form, publication seldom occurs simultaneously with the day
                                 of grant; instead, publication occurs a short time thereafter. There also are a
                                 few countries in which publication does not take place until several years after
                                 the grant.

                                 If these fees are not paid within the time allowed, the patent lapses and is no
                                 longer in force. This lapsing does not affect the use of the patent as a

                              that priority has been claimed and to give the country, date, and number of the
                              priority&nbsp;application. This data serves the purpose, among others, of enabling any

                              the second application is identical in substance to the specification of the first.
                              In many instances, the second, if in another language, is simply a translation of the
                              first with perhaps some variation in purely formal parts. But in a minority of cases,
                              the two may not be identical. For instance, sometimes two applications filed in one
                              country are combined into one second application which is filed in another country.
                              Alternatively, a second application could be filed for only part of the disclosure of
                              the priority application. The second application may have the relationship to the
                              first which we refer to as a continuation-in-part (e.g., the&nbsp;second application
                              includes additional subject matter discovered after the first was filed). In
                              some&nbsp;instances, the second application could have its disclosure diminished or
                              increased, to meet the requirements or practices of the second

                              foreign language specification as a reference, while at the same time citing an
                              English language version of the specification with a later date as a convenient

                              be desirable to determine if the foreign application has issued or has been
                              published, to see if there is an earlier date. For example, it has occurred that an
                              examiner rejected claims on the basis of a U.S. patent and the applicant filed
                              affidavits to overcome the filing date of the reference; the affidavits were
                              controversial and the case went to appeal, with an extensive brief and an examiner’s
                              answer having been filed. After all this work, somebody noticed that the U.S. patent
                              reference claimed the priority of a foreign application filed in a country in which
                              patents were issued fairly soon, checked the foreign application, and discovered that
                              the foreign patent had not only been issued, but also published in printed form, more
                              than 1 year prior to the filing date of the application on appeal.

                              the latter is abandoned, still pending, or patented. Even if the U.S. case is or
                              becomes patented, however, the foreign documents may still be useful as supplying an
                              earlier printed publication date.

                              patented or published at an earlier date. As an example, if a British specification
                              being considered as a reference claims the priority of an application filed in
                              Belgium, it is known at once that a considerably earlier effective date can be
                              established, if needed, because Belgian patents issue soon after filing. In addition,
                              if the application referred to was filed in one of the countries which publish
                              applications in printed form 18 months after filing, the subject matter of the
                              application will be available as a printed publication as of the 18 month publishing
                              date. These remarks obviously also apply to a U.S. patent claiming a foreign
                              priority.

                              utilized for locating corresponding patents. One source is the Derwent World Patents
                              Index (DWPI) and INPADOC. Additionally,<i>Chemical

                              large number of countries. Only one patent or published specification from a family
                              is abstracted in full and any related family members issued or published are
                              cross-referenced. <i>Chemical Abstracts</i> is available

                              outside the Paris Convention year from an earlier application, the later application
                              may not refer to the first application. It is hence possible that there will be
                              duplicate specifications published without any indication revealing the fact. These
                              may be detected when the two copies come together in the same subclass. Because the
                              later application is filed outside the convention year, the earlier application may
                              be prior art to the latter if it has been published or issued.

                                 documents are related to each other and are merely separate documents published at
                                 different stages of the same invention’s patenting process. Usually, this related
                                 group of documents includes a published application which ripens into an issued
                                 patent. Within each box of the second column of each row, the top listed document
                                 of a related group is the one that is “published” first (e.g., made available for
                                 public inspection by laying open application, or application printed and
                                 disseminated to the public). Once an examiner determines the country or
                                 organization publishing the documents, the name of the document can be located in
                                 the second column of the table and the examiner can determine if a document from
                                 the related group containing the same or similar disclosure having an earlier date
                                 is available as a reference. Usually, the documents within a related group have
                                 identical disclosures; sometimes, however, there are differences in the claims or
                                 minor differences in the specification. Therefore, examiners should always verify
                                 that the earlier related document also includes the subject matter necessary for
                                 the rejection. Some countries issue more than one type of patent and for clarity,
                                 in these situations, separate rows are provided for each type.

                                 for patents and like documents. INID codes for industrial designs are provided

                              Patent and Trademark Office (Office) received copies of the published specifications
                              of patents and patent applications from nearly all the countries which issue them in
                              printed form. The Office now receives most foreign patents in the form of CD-ROM
                              disks and other electronic media. The foreign patents so obtained are available to
                              examiners from the USPTO’s automated search tools such as the Examiner’s Automated
                              Search Tool (EAST), the Web-based Examiner Search Tool (WEST) and the Foreign Patent
                              Access System (FPAS), and from the Foreign Patent and Scientific Literature Branch of
                              the Scientific and Technical Information Center (STIC). The U.S. has agreements with
                              these countries to exchange patent documentation.

                           <p id="d0e113172">Until October 1995, it was the
                              practice in the Office to classify and place only a single patent family member for
                              each invention in the examiner search files. In addition, all non-English language
                              patent documents placed in the examiner files were accompanied, to the extent
                              possible, by an English language abstract. For countries where the specification is
                              printed twice, once during the application stage and again after the patent has been
                              granted, only the first printing was, in general, placed in the search files, since
                              the second printing ordinarily does not vary from the first as to
                              disclosure.

                              documents not printed or available for exchange, may come to the examiner’s
                              attention. For example, they may be cited in a motion to dissolve an interference, be
                              cited by applicants, or turn up in an online search. Upon request, STIC will obtain a
                              copy from its extensive collection, or if necessary, from the patent office of the
                              particular country. In the case of unprinted patent documents, STIC will request that
                              the date of granting and the date the specification was made available to the public
                              be indicated on the copies provided by the country of origin.

                              the Foreign Patent and Scientific Literature Branch of STIC. If examiners so choose,
                              they can make copies themselves. The most current patent documents are accessible
                              through the USPTO’s automated search systems, which allow public and USPTO users to

                           foreign patents classified in the former classification schedule, i.e., the schedule
                           that was the subject of the&nbsp;reclassification project. In certain instances, one&nbsp;or more
                           unnumbered titles precede these “FOR” subclasses to show the proper hierarchical
                           relationship for the indented foreign art collections. At the&nbsp;end of each “FOR” subclass
                           in the “foreign patent art collection,” there appears in parentheses the subclass number
                           under which the foreign patents had&nbsp;been classified prior to the reclassification
                           project. Subclass definitions for the “foreign patent art collection,” exactly
                           corresponding to those of said former classification schedule, are
                           maintained.
