                                                substantially</i>.</i> (A) Basic requirements.
                                          The restrictions of § <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e350777">11.10</a></b>(a)(1) apply only to those patents and
                                          patent applications in which a former Office employee had “personal
                                          and substantial participation,” exercised “through decision,
                                          approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice,
                                          investigation or otherwise.” To <i><i>participate personally</i></i> means directly, and includes the participation of a
                                          subordinate when actually directed by the former Office employee in
                                          the patent or patent application. <i><i>Substantially</i></i> means that the employee’s involvement must be of
                                          significance to the matter, or form a basis for a reasonable
                                          appearance of such significance. It requires more than official
                                          responsibility, knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or involvement
                                          on an administrative or peripheral issue. A finding of
                                          substantiality should be based not only on the effort devoted to a
                                          patent or patent application, but also on the importance of the
                                          effort. While a series of peripheral involvements may be
                                          insubstantial, the single act of approving or participation in a
                                          critical step may be substantial. It is essential that the
                                          participation be related to a “particular patent or patent
                                          application.” (<i>See</i> paragraph
                                          (b)(3)(iii) of this section.)

                                                participation on subjects not directly involving the
                                                substantive merits of a patent or patent application may not
                                                be “substantial,” even if it is time-consuming. An employee
                                                whose official responsibility is the review of a patent or
                                                patent application solely for compliance with administrative
                                                control or budgetary considerations and who reviews a
                                                particular patent or patent application for such a purpose
                                                should not be regarded as having participated substantially
                                                in the patent or patent application, except when such
                                                considerations also are the subject of the employee’s
                                                proposed representation.
                                             </li>

                                                official responsibility in determining substantial
                                                participation. <i><i>Official
                                                      responsibility</i></i> is defined in paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section.
                                                “Personal and substantial participation” is different from
                                                “official responsibility.” One’s responsibility may, however,
                                                play a role in determining the “substantiality” of an Office
                                                employee’s participation.

                                          whether intermediate or final, and either exercisable alone or with
                                          others, and either personally or through subordinates, to approve,

                                                assigned by statute, regulation, Executive Order, job
                                                description, or delegation of authority determine the scope
                                                of an employee’s “official responsibility”. All particular
                                                matters under consideration in the Office are under the
                                                “official responsibility” of the Director of the Office, and
                                                each is under that of any intermediate supervisor having
                                                responsibility for an employee who actually participates in
                                                the patent or patent application within the scope of his or
                                                her duties. A patent examiner would have “official

                                                or her.

                                                matters and official responsibility. <i><i>Administrative</i></i> authority as used in paragraph (v) of this section
                                                means authority for planning, organizing and controlling a
                                                patent or patent application rather than authority to review
                                                or make decisions on ancillary aspects of a patent or patent
                                                application such as the regularity of budgeting procedures,
                                                public or community relations aspects, or equal employment
                                                opportunity considerations. Responsibility for such an
                                                ancillary consideration does not constitute official
                                                responsibility for the particular patent or patent
                                                application, except when such a consideration is also the
                                                subject of the employee’s proposed
                                                representation.
                                             </li>
                                             <li id="d0e162834" class="nobull">(C) Duty to
                                                inquire. In order for a former employee, <i><i>e.g.</i></i>, former patent examiner, to be barred from
                                                representing or assisting in representing another as to a
                                                particular patent or patent application, he or she need not
                                                have known, while employed by the Office, that the patent or
                                                patent application was pending under his or her official
                                                responsibility. The former employee has a reasonable duty of
                                                inquiry to learn whether the patent or patent application had
                                                been under his or her official responsibility. Ordinarily, a
                                                former employee who is asked to represent another on a patent
                                                or patent application will become aware of facts sufficient
                                                to suggest the relationship of the prior matter to his or her
                                                former office, <i><i>e.g</i>.</i>,
                                                technology center, group or art unit. If so, he or she is
                                                under a duty to make further inquiry. It would be prudent for
                                                an employee to maintain a record of only patent application
                                                numbers of the applications actually acted upon by decision
                                                or recommendation, as well as those applications under the
                                                employee’s official responsibility which he or she has not
                                                acted upon.
                                             </li>
                                             <li id="d0e162847" class="nobull">(D) Self-disqualification. A former employee, <i><i>e.g.</i></i>, former patent examiner, cannot avoid the
                                                restrictions of this section through self-disqualification
                                                with respect to a patent or patent application for which he
                                                or she otherwise had official responsibility. However, an
                                                employee who through self-disqualification does not
                                                participate personally and substantially in a particular
                                                patent or patent application is not subject to the lifetime
                                                restriction of paragraph (b)(1) of this
                                                section.
                                             </li>

                                       <li id="d0e162855" class="nobull">(vi) <i><i>Pending</i></i> means that the matter was in fact referred to or under
                                          consideration by persons within the employee’s area of official
                                          responsibility.
                                       </li>

                                 <li id="d0e162862" class="nobull">(4) Measurement of the
                                    two-year restriction period. The two-year period under paragraph (b)(2)
                                    of this section is measured from the date when the employee’s official
                                    responsibility in a particular area ends, not from the termination of
                                    service in the Office, unless the two occur simultaneously. The
                                    prohibition applies to all particular patents or patent applications
                                    subject to such official responsibility in the one-year period before
                                    termination of such responsibility.
                                 </li>

                           <li id="d0e162866" class="nobull">(c) <i><i>Former employees of the Office</i></i>. This section imposes restrictions generally parallel to those
                              imposed in 18 U.S.C. 207(a) and (b)(1). This section, however, does not
                              interpret these statutory provisions or any other post-employment restrictions
                              that may apply to former Office employees, and such former employees should not
                              assume that conduct not prohibited by this section is otherwise permissible.
                              Former employees of the Office, whether or not they are practitioners, are
                              encouraged to contact the Department of Commerce for information concerning
                              applicable post-employment restrictions.

                           <li id="d0e162873" class="nobull">(d) An employee of the Office
                              may not prosecute or aid in any manner in the prosecution of any patent
                              application before the Office.
