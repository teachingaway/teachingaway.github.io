                           because the Office intends to expunge the entire originally-filed request once a
                           corrected request is received. For this reason, a corrected request must contain all of
                           the required information without reliance on any defective originally-filed request. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch2800_d20028_21186_219">If all applicable fees have already been
                           paid, these fees do not have to be resubmitted with the corrected request. Also, as
                           discussed previously, even if the request (either the originally-filed request or the
                           corrected request) is determined to be defective, the Office has the discretion under
                           <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1d8bb_1417f_2d4">37

                                 </a></b>. For example, if the Office determines that a corrected request
                           only contains one or more defects of minor character, the Office may, in its sole
                           discretion, enter the defective corrected request, correct the defect(s) <i>sua
                              sponte</i>, and/or request a submission from the patent owner in order to
                           correct the defect(s). As a specific example, if the defect in the corrected request is
                           limited to the omission of a copy of the patent for which supplemental examination is
                           requested, and the copy of the patent was submitted with the originally-filed request,
                           the Office may exercise its option to <i>sua sponte</i> accept the original
                           submission of the copy of the patent as part of the corrected request.
