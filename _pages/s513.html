                           paper or fee in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (Office). The date of deposit with
                           the USPS is shown by the “date-in” on the “Express Mail” mailing label or other official
                           USPS notation. This holds true for any day that the correspondence may be accepted as
                           “Express Mail” by the USPS, even when the paper or fee is deposited and accepted on a
                           Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday within the District of Columbia. For example, if a

                           therefore, the person could not have filed the application by depositing it directly at
                           the Office on that Saturday. See <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313447">37 CFR 1.6(a)(1)</a></b>. In those cases

                           Addressee” service of the USPS. This service provides for the use of a mailing label on
                           which the USPS clearly indicates the date on which it was deposited. Correspondence sent
                           by the “Express Mail Post Office to Addressee” service is considered filed in the Office
                           on the “date-in” entered by the USPS. The “date-in” on the “Express Mail” mailing label
                           must be completed by the USPS, not by the applicant. For correspondence filed in
                           accordance with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313951">37 CFR 1.10</a></b>, Office personnel will
                           routinely look to the “Express Mail” mailing label, and stamp the “date-in” or other
                           official USPS notation as the filing date of the correspondence. Accordingly, if the
                           USPS enters the deposit date as its “date-in,” the correspondence will receive the
                           deposit date as its filing date. If the USPS deposit date cannot be determined, the
                           correspondence will be accorded the date of receipt in the Office as the filing date. An
                           applicant may file a petition under the conditions specified in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313951">37 CFR

                           directly with an employee of the USPS to ensure that the person depositing the
                           correspondence receives a legible copy of the “Express Mail” mailing label with the
                           “date-in” clearly marked, and that persons dealing indirectly with the employees of the
                           USPS (such as by depositing correspondence in an “Express Mail” drop box) do so at the
                           risk of not receiving a copy of the “Express Mail” mailing label with the desired
                           “date-in” clearly marked. On petition, the failure to obtain an “Express Mail” receipt

                           avoided by the exercise of due care, as discussed below. While the Office strongly urges
