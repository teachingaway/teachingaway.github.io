                        requester to discuss a request that fails to comply with the filing date requirements for
                        filing a reexamination request, because there is no reexamination proceeding

                        of patents undergoing <i>ex parte</i> reexamination or their

                        members present at an interview requested by the patent owner to discuss that action. An
                        interview such as a telephone interview initiated by the examiner to obtain an amendment to

                        not be had prior to the first Office action following the order for reexamination and any

                        will be permitted prior to the first Office action <i>only</i>
                        where the examiner initiates the interview for the purpose of providing an amendment which
                        will make the claims patentable and the patent owner’s role is passive. The patent owner’s
                        role (or patent owner’s attorney or agent) is limited to agreeing to the change or not. The
                        patent owner should not otherwise discuss the case on the merits during this
                        interview.

                     <p id="d0e234268">Where any party who is not the patent
                        owner requests information as to the merits of a reexamination proceeding, the examiner
                        will <span class="Underline">not</span> conduct a personal or telephone interview
                        with that party to provide the information. Only questions on strictly procedural matters,
                        i.e., not directed to any specific reexamination proceeding, may be discussed with that
                        party. The party who is not the patent owner should be referred by the examiner to the
                        Central Reexamination Unit (CRU) Supervisory Patent Reexamination Specialist (SPRS) or
                        Technology Center (TC) Quality Assurance Specialist (QAS) to address any such questions on
                        strictly procedural matters. See <b><a href="s2212.html#d0e222159">MPEP § 2212.01</a></b>. The following guidelines
                        are to be followed in determining whether a question is strictly directed to a procedural
                        matter: (A) any information which a person could obtain by reading the file (which is open
                        to the public) is procedural, and it may be discussed; (B) a matter not available from a
                        reading of the file is considered as relating to the merits of the proceeding, and may not
                        be discussed. Thus, for example, a question relating to when the next Office action will be
                        rendered is improper as it relates to the merits of the proceeding (because this
                        information cannot be obtained from a reading of the file). Such a question by a party who
                        is not the patent owner should not be responded to by the examiner or any other
                        official.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e234284">The examiner must complete an <i>Ex Parte</i> Interview Summary form PTOL-474 for each interview

                              713.04</a></b>). A copy of the form should be given to the patent owner
                        at the conclusion of the interview. The original should be made of record in the
                        reexamination file, and a copy should be mailed to any third party
                        requester.

                        with special dispatch within the Office.” Accordingly, there are additional procedural
                        requirements to facilitate the statutory mandate for “special dispatch.”

                     <p id="d0e234308">In the case where the patent owner
                        desires to initiate an interview, the patent owner should initially contact the examiner in
                        charge of the proceeding to indicate what issues are sought to be discussed, and to
                        determine if an interview will be granted. If the examiner agrees to grant the interview,
                        the patent owner must file, at least three (3) working days prior to the interview, an
                        informal written statement of the issues to be discussed at the interview, and an informal
                        copy of any proposed claims to be discussed, unless examiner waives this requirement. The
                        copy of these materials is to be submitted by facsimile transmission (FAX) directly to the
                        examiner or hand-carried to the examiner so as to avoid the possibility of delay in
                        matching the materials with the file. The informal copies that are considered by the
                        examiner will be made of record in the reexamination proceeding as an attachment to the
                        Interview Summary form PTOL-474 completed by the examiner after the interview. These
                        preliminary steps are for the purpose of providing structure to the interview so as to
                        facilitate the statutory mandate for special dispatch.

                     <p id="d0e234326">The duration of the interview will not
                        exceed one hour, unless the patent owner files a petition under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324988">37&nbsp;CFR

                        reexamination proceeding, the invention should be well defined after the patent has issued,
                        and it is simply a matter of defining the claims over art applied, to the extent such is
                        deemed necessary. An hour of time in a structured planned interview should be sufficient to
                        accomplish this, and in those rare instances where it is not, a patent owner may show cause
                        to extend the time. During the interview, the examiner is always free to extend the
                        duration of the interview to discuss issues that the examiner deems appropriate for
                        (further) discussion. Such an extension of the duration of the interview is permitted at
                        the examiner’s sole discretion.

                        explain why the information to be presented could not have been presented sooner, given the

                        party requesting a second interview after final rejection must provide an advance showing
                        that would "convince" a reasonable examiner that "it will expedite the issues for appeal or
