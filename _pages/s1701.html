                        Members of the patent examining corps are cautioned to be especially wary of any inquiry
                        from any person outside the USPTO, including an employee of another U.S. Government agency,
                        the answer to which might indicate that a particular patent should not have issued. No
                        USPTO employee may pursue a bounty offered by a private sector source for identifying prior
                        art. The acceptance of payments from outside sources for prior art search activities may
                        subject the employee to administrative disciplinary action.

                     <p id="d0e162425">When a field of search for an invention
                        is requested, examiners should routinely inquire whether the invention has been patented in
                        the United States. If the invention has been patented, no field of search should be
                        suggested.

                        from any person outside the USPTO as to whether or not a certain reference or other
                        particular evidence was considered during the examination or proceeding and whether or not
                        a claim would have been allowed over that reference or other evidence had it been
                        considered during the examination or proceeding. Likewise, <i>employees</i> are cautioned against answering any inquiry concerning any entry in
                        the patent or reexamination file, including the extent of the field of search and any entry
                        relating thereto. The record of the file of a patent or reexamination proceeding must speak
