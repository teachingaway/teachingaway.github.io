                           basis that there is no SNQ by requesting reconsideration of the examiner's SNQ
                           determination in a patent owner’s statement under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e330194">37 CFR 1.530</a></b> discussing the SNQ
                           raised in the reexamination order for the examiner's consideration. See
                           <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306521">35 U.S.C.
                                 304</a></b>. When the examiner makes a rejection based in whole or in part
                           on a reference (patent or printed publication) in an Office action, the patent owner may
                           present a challenge to the examiner's SNQ determination by requesting reconsideration of
                           the examiner's determination that the reference raises a SNQ and presenting appropriate
                           arguments in the response to the Office action. See <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322515">37 CFR 1.111(b)</a></b> (the patent owner's
                           response to an Office action must point out the supposed errors in the examiner's action
                           and must reply to every ground of objection and rejection in the Office action). By
                           presenting arguments regarding the SNQ to the examiner in the early stages of the
                           proceeding, the patent owner helps the Office to resolve the issues quickly. For
                           example, if the patent owner timely files a statement or response, and the examiner
                           agrees with the patent owner that no SNQ has been raised in the <i>ex
                              parte</i> reexamination proceeding, then the proceeding prosecution will be
                           terminated or the reexamination order will be vacated (whichever is appropriate).
                           However, if the examiner determines that the SNQ is proper, further review can be
                           obtained by exhausting the patent owner's rights through the reexamination proceeding
                           and ultimately seeking review before the Board - along with an appeal of any rejections.
                           To obtain review of the SNQ issue, patent owner must include the SNQ issue and the
                           appropriate arguments in its appeal brief to the Board.

                           reexamination proceedings ordered on or after June 25, 2010, the patent owner may seek a
                           final agency decision from the Board on the SNQ issue only if the patent owner has first
                           requested reconsideration before the examiner (e.g., in a patent owner's statement under
                           <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e330194">37 CFR

                           then seeks review of the examiner's SNQ determination before the Board. In its appeal
                           brief, the patent owner is to clearly present the issue and arguments regarding the
                           examiner's SNQ determination under a separate heading and identify the communication in
                           which the patent owner first requested reconsideration before the examiner. (For

                           if the patent owner presents the SNQ issue in its appeal brief, the Board panel will
                           review the procedural SNQ issue along with its review of any rejections in an appeal and
                           will enter a final agency decision accordingly.) See <b><a href="s2274.html#d0e233528">MPEP § 2274</a></b> for
