                        of the date the request for extension is submitted, and (B) why, in spite of the action
                        taken thus far, the requested additional time is needed. The statement of (A) must provide
                        a factual accounting of reasonably diligent behavior by all those responsible for preparing
                        a response to the outstanding Office action within the statutory time period. All requests

                           and even a response that is not signed. An object of this practice is to obviate the
                           necessity for appeal merely to gain time to consider the examiner’s position in reply to
                           an amendment timely filed after final rejection. Accordingly, the shortened statutory
                           period for response to a final rejection to which a proposed first response has been
                           received will be extended 1 month. Note that the Office policy of construing a response
                           after final as inherently including a request for a 1-month extension of time applies
                           only to the <span class="Underline">first</span> response to the final
                           rejection. This automatic 1-month extension of time does <span class="Underline">not</span> apply once the Notice of Appeal has been filed. In that instance,
                           the patent owner will be notified that an appeal brief is due two months from the date
                           of the notice of appeal to avoid dismissal of the appeal, and extensions of time are
                           governed by <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e330470">37&nbsp;CFR 1.550(c)</a></b>.

                        <p id="d0e231194">It should be noted that the patent
                           owner is entitled to know the examiner’s ruling on a timely response filed after final
                           rejection before being required to file a notice of appeal. Notification of the
                           examiner’s ruling should reach the patent owner with sufficient time for the patent
                           owner to consider the ruling and act on it.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e231197">Normally, examiners will complete a
                           response to an amendment after final rejection within 5 days after receipt thereof. In
                           those situations where the advisory action cannot be mailed in sufficient time for the
                           patent owner to consider the examiner’s position with respect to the amendment after
                           final rejection (or other patent owner paper) and act on it before termination of the
                           prosecution of the proceeding, the granting of additional time to complete the response
                           to the final rejection or to take other appropriate action would be appropriate. See
                           <i>Theodore Groz &amp; Sohne &amp; Ernst Bechert Nadelfabrik
                              KG v. Quigg</i>, 10 USPQ2d 1787 (D.D.C. 1988). The additional time should be
                           granted by the examiner, and the time granted should be set forth in the advisory Office
                           action. The advisory action form, <i>Ex Parte</i>
                           Reexamination Advisory Action Before the Filing of an Appeal Brief (PTOL-467), states
                           that “THE PERIOD FOR RESPONSE IS EXTENDED TO RUN ___ MONTHS FROM THE MAILING DATE OF THE
                           FINAL REJECTION.” The blank before “MONTHS” should be filled in with an integer (2, 3,
                           4, 5, or 6); fractional months should not be indicated. In no case can the period for
                           reply to the final rejection be extended to exceed 6 months from the mailing date of the
                           final rejection. An appropriate response (e.g., a second or subsequent amendment or a
                           notice of appeal) must be filed within the extended period for response. If patent owner
                           elects to file a second or subsequent amendment, it must place the reexamination in
                           condition for allowance. If the amendment does not place the reexamination in condition
                           for allowance, the prosecution of the reexamination proceeding will stand terminated
                           under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e330470">37&nbsp;CFR 1.550(d)</a></b> unless an appropriate notice of appeal was filed
                           before the expiration of the response period.

                           &nbsp;&nbsp;EXTENSIONS OF TIME TO SUBMIT AFFIDAVITS AFTER FINAL
                           REJECTION
                        </h2>
                        <p id="d0e231213">Frequently, patent owners request an
                           extension of time, stating as a reason therefor that more time is needed in which to
                           submit an affidavit. When such a request is filed after final rejection, the granting of
                           the request for extension of time is without prejudice to the right of the examiner to
                           question why the affidavit is now necessary and why it was not earlier presented. If the
                           patent owner’s showing is insufficient, the examiner may deny entry of the affidavit,
                           notwithstanding the previous grant of an extension of time to submit it. The grant of an
                           extension of time in these circumstances serves merely to keep the prosecution of the
                           proceeding from becoming terminated while allowing the patent owner the opportunity to
                           present the affidavit or to take other appropriate action. Moreover, prosecution of the
                           reexamination to save it from termination must include such timely, complete and proper
                           action as required by <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322575">37 CFR 1.113</a></b>. The admission of the
                           affidavit for purposes other than allowance of the claims, or the refusal to admit the
                           affidavit, and any proceedings relative, thereto, shall not operate to save the
                           prosecution of the proceeding from termination.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e231219">Implicit in the above practice is
                           the fact that affidavits submitted after final rejection are subject to the same
                           treatment as amendments submitted after final rejection. See <i>In re Affidavit Filed After Final Rejection,</i> 152 USPQ 292, 1966 C.D. 53
                           (Comm’r Pat. 1966).
