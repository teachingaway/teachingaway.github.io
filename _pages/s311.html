                           <li id="d0e19267" class="nobull">(a) A contract involving a
                              patent or any right under a patent may contain a provision requiring
                              arbitration of any dispute relating to patent validity or infringement arising
                              under the contract. In the absence of such a provision, the parties to an
                              existing patent validity or infringement dispute may agree in writing to settle
                              such dispute by arbitration. Any such provision or agreement shall be valid,
                              irrevocable, and enforceable, except for any grounds that exist at law or in
                              equity for revocation of a contract.

                           <li id="d0e19274" class="nobull">(b) Arbitration of such
                              disputes, awards by arbitrators, and confirmation of awards shall be governed
                              by title 9, to the extent such title is not inconsistent with this section. In
                              any such arbitration proceeding, the defenses provided for
                              under<b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305845"> section 282</a></b> shall be

                              have no force or effect on any other person. The parties to an arbitration may
                              agree that in the event a patent which is the subject matter of an award is
                              subsequently determined to be invalid or unenforceable in a judgment rendered
                              by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no appeal can or has been
                              taken, such award may be modified by any court of competent jurisdiction upon
                              application by any party to the arbitration. Any such modification shall govern
                              the rights and obligations between such parties from the date of such
                              modification.

                              arbitrator, the patentee, his assignee or licensee shall give notice thereof in
                              writing to the Director. There shall be a separate notice prepared for each
                              patent involved in such proceeding. Such notice shall set forth the names and
                              addresses of the parties, the name of the inventor, and the name of the patent
                              owner, shall designate the number of the patent, and shall contain a copy of
                              the award. If an award is modified by a court, the party requesting such
                              modification shall give notice of such modification to the Director. The
                              Director shall, upon receipt of either notice, enter the same in the record of
                              the prosecution of such patent. If the required notice is not filed with the
                              Director, any party to the proceeding may provide such notice to the
                              Director.
