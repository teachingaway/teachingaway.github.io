                        Issue Fee  [R-08.2012]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e133406">The issue fee and any required
                        publication fee are due 3 months from the date of the Notice of Allowance. The amount of
                        the issue fee and any required publication fee are shown on the Notice of Allowance. The
                        Notice of Allowance will also reflect any issue fee previously paid in the application. The
                        issue fee due does not reflect a credit for any previously paid issue fee in the
                        application. If an issue fee has previously been paid in the application as reflected in
                        the Notice of Allowance, the return of Part B (Fee(s) Transmittal form) will be considered
                        a request to reapply the previously paid issue fee toward the issue fee that is now due.
                        For example, if the application was allowed and the issue fee paid, but applicant withdrew
                        the application from issue and filed a Request for Continued Examination (RCE) and the
                        application was later allowed, the Notice of Allowance will reflect an issue fee amount
                        that is due and the issue fee that was previously paid. Had applicant filed a Continued
                        Prosecution Application (CPA) instead of an RCE, the Notice of Allowance would not reflect
                        any issue fee paid before the CPA was filed because the issue fee was paid in a prior
                        application. Note that because the amount of the fees(s) due is determined by the fees set
                        forth in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e315894">37 CFR 1.18</a></b> which are in effect as of the date of submission of
                        payment of the fees(s), the amount due at the time the fee(s) are paid may differ from the
                        amount indicated on the Notice of Allowance. Accordingly, applicants are encouraged, at the
                        time of submitting payment of the fees(s), to determine whether the amount of the issue fee
                        due or any required publication fee has changed to avoid the patent lapsing for failure to
                        pay the balance of the issue fee due (37 CFR <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e326432">1.317</a></b>) or becoming
                        abandoned for failure to pay the publication fee. The amounts due under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e301581">35&nbsp;U.S.C.
                              41(a)</a></b> (i.e., the issue fee, but not the publication fee) are reduced

                        Fee(s) Transmittal form is filed without payment of the issue fee, a general authorization
                        to pay fees or a specific authorization to pay the issue fee, submitted prior to the
                        mailing of a notice of allowance, will be allowed to act as payment of the correct issue

                        deposit account will still be charged the required issue fee and any required publication
                        fee.
