                        </h1>
                        <p id="d0e131479">When an application is apparently
                           ready for allowance, it should be reviewed by the examiner to make certain that the
                           whole application meets all formal and substantive (i.e., statutory) requirements and
                           that the language of the claims is enabled by, and finds adequate descriptive support
                           in, the application disclosure as originally filed. Neglect to give due attention to
                           these matters may lead to confusion as to the scope of the patent.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e131482">Frequently, the invention as
                           originally described and claimed was of much greater scope than that defined in the
                           claims as allowed. Some or much of the subject matter disclosed may be entirely outside
                           the bounds of the claims accepted by the applicant. In such case, the examiner should
                           require the applicant to modify the brief summary of the invention and restrict the
                           descriptive matter so as to be in harmony with the claims. However valuable for
                           reference purposes the examiner may consider the matter which is extraneous to the
                           claimed invention, patents should be&nbsp;confined in their disclosures to the respective
                           inventions patented (see <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320131">37 CFR 1.71</a></b> and 1.73). Of course,
                           enough background should be included to make the invention clearly understandable. See

                           the original claims follow the nomenclature of the specification; but sometimes in

                           in the specification. This may result in uncertainty as to the interpretation to be
                           given such terms. See <b><a href="s608.html#d0e46173">MPEP § 608.01(o)</a></b>. It should be noted,

                           Such pertinent art should be listed as usual on form PTO-892, a copy of which is
                           attached to the Notice of Allowability form PTOL-37. Such pertinent art is not sent to
                           the applicant, but foreign patent documents and non-patent literature will be scanned

                              issued patents by providing a complete file history which should clearly reflect, as
                              much as is reasonably possible, the reasons why the application was allowed. Such
                              information facilitates evaluation of the scope and strength of a patent by the
                              patentee and the public and may help avoid or simplify litigation of a
                              patent.

                           <p id="d0e132692">The practice of stating the
                              reasons for allowance is not new, and the rule merely formalizes the examiner’s
                              existing authority to do so and provides applicants or patent owners an opportunity
                              to comment upon any such statement of the examiner.

                              setting forth of reasons for allowance is not mandatory on the examiner’s part.
                              However, in meeting the need for the application file history to speak for itself, it
                              is incumbent upon the examiner in exercising his or her responsibility to the public,
                              to see that the file history is as complete as is reasonably
                              possible.

                              acted upon and allowed, the examiner is expected to determine, at the same time,
                              whether the reasons why the application is being allowed are evident from the
                              record.

                              may also specify allowable subject matter and provide reasons for indicating such
                              allowable subject matter in an Office communication.

                              actions and the applicant’s replies make evident the reasons for allowance,
                              satisfying the “record as a whole” proviso of the rule. This is particularly true
                              when applicant fully complies with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322449">37 CFR 1.111</a></b> (b)

                              examiner’s actions clearly point out the reasons for rejection and the applicant’s
                              reply explicitly presents reasons why claims are patentable over the reference, the
                              reasons for allowance are in all probability evident from the record and <b id="d0e132725">no</b> statement should be necessary. Conversely, where the
                              record is not explicit as to reasons, but allowance is in order, then a logical
                              extension of <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322449">37 CFR 1.111</a></b> and 1.133 would
                              dictate that the examiner should make reasons of record and such reasons should be
                              specific.

                           <p id="d0e132732">Where specific reasons are
                              recorded by the examiner, care must be taken to ensure that statements of reasons for
                              allowance (or indication of allowable subject matter) are accurate, precise, and do
                              not place unwarranted interpretations, whether broad or narrow, upon the claims. The
                              examiner should keep in mind the possible misinterpretations of his or her statement
                              that may be made and its possible effects. Each statement should include at least (1)
                              the major difference in the claims not found in the prior art of record, and (2) the
                              reasons why that difference is considered to define patentably over the prior art if
                              either of these reasons for allowance is not clear in the record. The statement is
                              not intended to necessarily state all the reasons for allowance or all the details
                              why claims are allowed and should not be written to specifically or impliedly state
                              that all the reasons for allowance are set forth. Where the examiner has a large
                              number of reasons for allowing a claim, it may suffice to state only the major or
                              important reasons, being careful to so couch the statement. For example, a statement
                              might start: “The primary reason for the allowance of the claims is the inclusion of
                              the limitationin all the claims which is not found in the prior art references,” with
                              further amplification as necessary.

                              meaningless or uninformative statements of the reasons for the allowance should not
                              be used. It is improper to use a statement of reasons for allowance to attempt to
                              narrow a claim by providing a special definition to a claim limitation which is
                              argued by applicant, but not supported by a special definition in the description in
                              cases where the ordinary meaning of the term in the prior art demonstrates that the
                              claim remains unpatentable for the reasons of record, and where such claim narrowing
                              is only tangential to patentability. Cf. <i>Festo Corp. v.

                                    allowance of the claims is the inclusion of .03 to .05 percent nickel in all
                                    of the claims. Applicant’s second affidavit in example 5 shows unexpected
                                    results from this restricted range.

                                    the examiner stated that applicant’s remarks about the placement of the
                                    primary teaching’s grid member were persuasive, but he pointed out that
                                    applicant did not claim the member as being within the reactor. Thus, an
                                    amendment doing such was agreed to.

                                    invention patented in Pat. No. 3,953,224. The claims comprise baffle means
                                    12 whose effective length in the extraction tower may be varied so as to
                                    optimize and to control the extraction process.

                                    as to the pressure used during compression was agreed to during the
                                    telephone interview with applicants’ attorney. During said interview, it was
                                    noted that applicants contended in their amendment that a process of the
                                    combined applied teachings could not result in a successful article within a
                                    particular pressure range (see page 3, bottom, of applicant’s amendment).
                                    The examiner agreed and allowed the application after incorporating the
                                    pressure range into the claim.

                                    art first to eliminate one of top members 4, second to eliminate plate 3,
                                    third to attach remaining member 4 directly to tube 2 and finally to
                                    substitute this modified handle for the handle 20 of Nania (see Fig. 1)

                                    of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which is hereby incorporated by
                                    reference. As noted therein, and as argued on page -- of Appellant’s brief,
                                    the claimed invention requires a one piece tubular member whereas the
                                    closest prior art requires a multiple piece assembly which does not teach or
                                    suggest the claimed invention.

                                    instant composition. The examiner in the art also did not know of any art
                                    which could be used against the instant composition.

                           </h2>
                           <p id="d0e133049"> The examiner’s statement of
                              reasons for allowance is an important source of prosecution file history. See
                              <i>Zenith Labs., Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb
                                 Co.,</i> 19 F.3d 1418, 30 USPQ2d 1285 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The examiner’s
                              statement of reasons for allowance is the personal opinion of the examiner as to why
                              the claims are allowable. The examiner’s statement should not create an <i>estoppel</i>. Only applicant’s statements should create an
                              <i>estoppel</i>. The failure of applicant to comment
                              on the examiner’s statement of reasons for allowance should not be treated as
                              acquiescence to the examiner’s statement. See <i>Salazar v.
                                 Procter &amp; Gamble Co</i>., 414 F.3d 1342, 1347, 75 USPQ2d 1369, 1373
                              (Fed. Cir. 2005). Any inferences or presumption are to be determined on a
                              case-by-case basis by a court reviewing the patent, the USPTO examining the patent in
                              a reissue application or a reexamination proceeding, the Board of Patent Appeals and
                              Interferences reviewing the patent in an interference proceeding, etc. Applicant may
                              set forth his or her position if he or she disagrees with the examiner’s reasons for
                              allowance.
                           </p>
                           <p id="d0e133068">Comments filed by the applicant
                              on the examiner’s statement of reasons for allowance, should preferably be submitted
                              no later than the payment of the issue fee, to avoid processing delays. Such
                              submissions should be clearly labeled “Comments on Statement of Reasons for
                              Allowance.” Comments will be entered in the application file by the Office of
                              Publication with an appropriate notation on the “Contents” list on the file wrapper. 
                           </p>
                           <p id="d0e133071"> The application file generally
                              will not be returned to the examiner after the entry of such comments made by
                              applicant on the examiner’s statement of reasons for allowance. Therefore, the
                              absence of an examiner’s response to applicant's comments does not mean that the
                              examiner agrees with or acquiesces in the reasoning of such comments. See 37 CFR
                              <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322124">1.104(e)</a></b>. While the examiner may review and comment upon such
                              a submission, the examiner has no obligation to do so.
