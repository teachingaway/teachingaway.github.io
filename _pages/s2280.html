                           <li id="d0e234052" class="nobull">(a) A patent by its very nature
                              is affected with a public interest. The public interest is best served, and the
                              most effective reexamination occurs when, at the time a reexamination
                              proceeding is being conducted, the Office is aware of and evaluates the
                              teachings of all information material to patentability in a reexamination
                              proceeding. Each individual associated with the patent owner in a reexamination
                              proceeding has a duty of candor and good faith in dealing with the Office,
                              which includes a duty to disclose to the Office all information known to that
                              individual to be material to patentability in a reexamination proceeding. The
                              individuals who have a duty to disclose to the Office all information known to
                              them to be material to patentability in a reexamination proceeding are the
                              patent owner, each attorney or agent who represents the patent owner, and every
                              other individual who is substantively involved on behalf of the patent owner in
                              a reexamination proceeding. The duty to disclose the information exists with
                              respect to each claim pending in the reexamination proceeding until the claim
                              is cancelled. Information material to the patentability of a cancelled claim
                              need not be submitted if the information is not material to patentability of
                              any claim remaining under consideration in the reexamination proceeding. The
                              duty to disclose all information known to be material to patentability in a
                              reexamination proceeding is deemed to be satisfied if all information known to
                              be material to patentability of any claim in the patent after issuance of the
                              reexamination certificate was cited by the Office or submitted to the Office in
                              an information disclosure statement. However, the duties of candor, good faith,
                              and disclosure have not been complied with if any fraud on the Office was
                              practiced or attempted or the duty of disclosure was violated through bad faith
                              or intentional misconduct by, or on behalf of, the patent owner in the
                              reexamination proceeding. Any information disclosure statement must be filed
                              with the items listed in ยง 1.98(a) as applied to individuals associated with
                              the patent owner in a reexamination proceeding, and should be filed within two
                              months of the date of the order for reexamination, or as soon thereafter as
                              possible.
