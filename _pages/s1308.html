                              because doing so may result in issuance of a patent without consideration of the RCE
                              (if the RCE is not matched with the application before the application is processed

                           Assurance administers a program for reviewing the quality of the examination of patent
                           applications. The general purpose of the program is to improve patent quality and
                           increase the likelihood of patents being found to be valid.
                        </p>

                           Review Quality Assurance Specialists on a randomly selected sample of allowed
                           applications from each examiner. The sample is computer generated under the office-wide
                           computer system (PALM), which selects a predetermined number of allowed applications
                           from each examiner per year for review . A subsample of the selected allowed
                           applications are both reviewed and independently searched by the reviewers. The only
                           applications excluded from the sample are those in which there has been a decision by
                           the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, or by a court.

                           applications. The program shall be used as an educational tool to aid in identifying
