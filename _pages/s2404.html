                        reference to a deposit is made in an application disclosure, as noted in paragraph (c). As
                        noted in paragraph (b), biological material need not be deposited unless access to such

                        Even where access to biological material is required to satisfy these statutory

                        <p id="d0e240824">In an application where the
                           invention required access to specific biological material, an applicant could show that
                           the biological material is accessible because it is known and readily available to the
                           public. The concepts of “known and readily available” are considered to reflect a level
                           of public accessibility to a necessary component of an invention disclosure that is
                           consistent with an ability to make and use the invention. To avoid the need for a
                           deposit on this basis, the biological material must be both known and readily available
                           - neither concept alone is sufficient. A material may be known in the sense that its
                           existence has been published, but is not available to those who wish to obtain that
                           particular known biological material. Likewise, a biological material may be available
                           in the sense that those having possession of it would make it available upon request,
                           but no one has been informed of its existence.

                           Interferences has held that a description of the precise geographic location of marine
                           tunicates, as a biological material, used in a claimed invention was adequate to satisfy
                           the enablement requirement of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>. <i>Ex Parte Rinehart</i>, 10 USPQ2d 1719 (Bd. Pat. App. &amp;
                           Int. 1985). The term “readily” used in the phrase “known and readily available” is
                           considered appropriate to define that degree of availability which would be reasonable
                           under the circumstances. If the biological material and its natural location can be
                           adequately described so that one skilled in the art could obtain it using ordinary skill
                           in the art, the disclosure would appear to be sufficient to meet the enablement
                           requirement of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">35 U.S.C. 112</a></b> without a deposit so

                           forever. Public access during the term of the patent may affect the enforceability of
                           the patent. Although there is a public interest in the availability of a deposited
                           biological material during and after the period of enforceability of the patent, there
                           should not be any undue concern about continued access to the public. See 37 CFR
                           <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333444">1.806</a></b> (the term of deposit is “at least thirty (30) years and at
                           least five (5) years after the most recent request” for a sample; the agreement
                           sufficiently ensures that the deposit will be “available beyond the enforceable life of
                           the patent”). Unless there is a reasonable basis to believe that the biological material
                           will cease to be available during the enforceable life of the patent, current
                           availability would satisfy the requirement. The incentives provided by the patent system
                           should not be constrained by the mere possibility that a disclosure that was once
                           enabling would become non-enabling over a period of time through no fault of the
                           patentee. <i>In re Metcalfe</i>, 410 F.2d 1378, 161 USPQ

                           accept that showing. In those instances, however, the applicant takes the risk that the
                           material may cease to be known and readily available. Such a defect cannot be cured by
                           reissue after the grant of a patent.

                           Int. 1992), held that the only manner in which applicants could satisfy their burden of
                           assuring public access to the needed biological material, and, thereby, compliance with
                           the enablement requirement of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, was by making an
                           appropriate deposit. The fact that applicants and other members of the public were able
                           to obtain the material in question from a given depository prior to and after the filing
                           date of the application in issue did not establish that upon issuance of a patent on the
                           application that such material would continue to be accessible to the public. The
                           applicants did not make of record any of the facts and circumstances surrounding their
                           access to the material in issue from the depository, nor was there any evidence as to
                           the depository’s policy regarding the material if a patent would have been granted.
                           Further, there was no assurance that the depository would have allowed unlimited access
                           to the material if the application had matured into a patent.

                        <p id="d0e240860">There are many factors that may be
                           used as indicia that a biological material is known and readily available to the public.
                           Relevant factors include commercial availability, references to the biological material
                           in printed publications, declarations of accessibility by those working in the field,
                           evidence of predictable isolation techniques, or an existing deposit made in accordance
                           with these rules. Each factor alone may or may not be sufficient to demonstrate that the
                           biological material is known and readily available. Those applicants that rely on
                           evidence of accessibility other than a deposit take the risk that the patent may no
                           longer be enforceable if the biological material necessary to satisfy the requirements

                           availability as evidence that a biological material is known and readily available only
                           when the evidence is clear and convincing that the public has access to the material.
                           See the final rule entitled “Deposit of Biological Materials for Patent Purposes,” 54 FR
                           34864, 34875 (August 22, 1989). A product could be commercially available but only at a
                           price that effectively eliminates accessibility to those desiring to obtain a sample.
                           The relationship between the applicant relying on a biological material and the
                           commercial supplier is one factor that would be considered in determining whether the
                           biological material was known and readily available. However, the mere fact that the
                           biological material is commercially available only through the patent holder or the
                           patent holder’s agents or assigns shall not, by itself, justify a finding that the
                           necessary material is not readily available, absent reason to believe that access to the
                           biological material would later be improperly restricted.
