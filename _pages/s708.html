                        inventions to which the applications relate. Nonprovisional applications are ordinarily
                        taken up for examination by the examiner to whom they have been assigned in the order in

                        shall be determined by the Director of the USPTO.

                        application in his or her docket, whether amended or new, which has the <i>oldest effective U.S. filing date</i>. This basic policy applies
                        to all applications; rare circumstances may justify TC Directors granting individual
                        exceptions.

                        continuation-in-part application is used for docketing purposes. However, the examiner may
                        act on a continuation-in-part application by using the effective filing date, if
                        desired.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e76265">If at any time an examiner determines
                        that the “effective filing date” status of any application differs from what the records
                        show, the technical support staff should be informed, who should promptly amend the records
                        to show the correct status, with the date of correction.
                     </p>

                        examiner is to give priority to reissue applications and to reexamination proceedings, with
                        top priority to reissue applications in which litigation has been stayed
                        (<b><a href="s1442.html#d0e141024">MPEP

                        due date, such as examiner’s answers and decisions on motions. Most other cases in the
                        “special” category (for example, interference cases, cases made special by petition, cases
                        ready for final conclusion, etc.) will continue in this category, with the earliest
                        effective U.S. filing date among them normally controlling priority.

                                 PRIORITIZED EXAMINATION
                              </h2>
                              <p id="ch700_d1d594_2a371_233">The time periods set for reply in Office
                                 actions for applications undergoing prioritized examination will be the same as
                                 set forth in MPEP § 710.02(b). This is a distinction between prioritized
                                 examination and the accelerated examination program, where the time period for
                                 reply to Office actions is one month (or at least thirty days) with no extensions
                                 under 37 CFR 1.136(a) being permitted (see MPEP § 708.02(a)). Where, however, an
                                 applicant files a petition for an extension of time to file a reply or files a
                                 request for suspension of action, the petition or request will be acted upon, but
                                 the prioritized examination of the application will be terminated. In addition,
                                 filing an amendment to the application which results in more than four independent
                                 claims, more than thirty total claims, or a multiple dependent claim will
                                 terminate the prioritized examination. Upon termination of prioritized
                                 examination, the application will be removed from the examiner’s special docket
                                 and placed on the examiner’s regular docket in accordance with its stage of
                                 prosecution.
                              </p>
                              <p id="ch700_d1d594_2a38f_3ca">The goal of the Office is to provide a
                                 final disposition within twelve months, on average, of the date that prioritized
                                 status was granted. The final disposition for the twelve-month goal means that
                                 within twelve months from the date prioritized status has been granted that one of
                                 the following occur: (A) Mailing of a notice of allowance; (B) mailing of a final
                                 Office action; (C) filing of a notice of appeal; (D) completion of examination as
                                 defined in 37 CFR 41.102; (E) filing of a request for continued examination; or
                                 (F) abandonment of the application. An application under prioritized examination,
                                 however, would not be accorded special status throughout its entire course of
                                 appeal or interference before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), or after
                                 the filing of a request for continued examination. As noted above, the submission
                                 of an amendment resulting in more than four independent claims or more than thirty
                                 total claims is not prohibited, but simply terminates the prioritized examination.
                                 Thus, upon mailing of a final rejection (at which point prioritized examination is
                                 terminated), applicants may amend the claims to place them in independent form
                                 where dependent claims were found allowable, or add new claims, subject only to
                                 the limitations applicable to any application under final rejection. See 37 CFR
                                 1.116. Similarly, upon mailing of a notice of allowance, applicants may submit
                                 amendments to the claims, again subject only to the limitations applicable to any
                                 application that has been allowed. See 37 CFR 1.312. A patent that issues will not
                                 contain any indication on its face that it was processed via prioritized
                                 examination.

                                 refunded. This fee will be refunded automatically (if paid) without the need for
                                 applicant to request such a refund. The processing fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(i)
                                 will be retained to cover the cost of processing the request. In accordance with

                                 examination fee, and any required application size or excess claim fees cannot be

                                 in accordance with 37 CFR 1.138(d). Furthermore, applicant may request a refund of

                                 published under 35 U.S.C. 122(b).
