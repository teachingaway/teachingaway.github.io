                     <p id="d0e134671">A reissue application is filed to
                        correct an error in the patent, where, as a result of the error, the patent is deemed
                        wholly or partly inoperative or invalid. An error in the patent arises out of an error in
                        conduct which was made in the preparation and/or prosecution of the application which
                        became the patent. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e134674">There must be at least one error in the
                        patent to provide grounds for reissue of the patent. If there is no error in the patent,
                        the patent will not be reissued. The present section provides a discussion of what may be
                        considered an error in the patent upon which to base a reissue application.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e134677">In accordance with <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C.
                              251</a></b>, the error upon which a reissue is based must be one which causes
                        the patent to be “deemed wholly or partly inoperative or invalid, by reason of a defective
                        specification or drawing, or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a
                        right to claim in the patent.” Thus, an error under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C. 251</a></b><i>has not been presented </i>where the correction to the

                        which does not cause the patent to be deemed wholly or partly inoperative or invalid for
                        the reasons specified in <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C. 251</a></b>. These corrections to a

                           2011) provides that “the omission of a narrower claim from a patent can render a patent
                           partly inoperative by failing to protect the disclosed invention to the full extent
                           allowed by law.” This permits submission of additional claims that are narrower in scope
                           than the preexisting patent claims, without any narrowing of the preexisting patent
                           claims. For example, a reissue applicant can retain the broad independent claims of the
                           patent while adding only new dependent claims.

                           defects in the specification, drawings, and claims. Instead, the court explained that
