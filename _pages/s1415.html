                              no longer due in the original patent, but rather the maintenance fees are due in the
                              reissue patent. This is because upon the issuance of the reissue patent, the original
                              patent is surrendered and ceases to exist.

                              reissue patent will be granted to replace a single original patent. The issuance of
                              more than one reissue patent does not alter the schedule of payments of maintenance
                              fees on the original patent. The existence of multiple reissue patents for one
                              original patent can arise where multiple divisional reissue applications are filed
                              for the same patent, and the multiple applications issue as reissue patents (all to
                              replace the same original patent). In addition, a divisional application or
                              continuation application of an existing reissue application may be filed, and both
                              may then issue as reissue patents. A single maintenance fee is required for all
                              reissue patents that replace the single original patent. The maintenance fee must be
                              directed to the latest reissue patent that has issued, i.e., the reissue patent with
                              the highest reissue patent number.
