                        Small Entity Status [R-08.2012]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e248965"> In order to establish small entity
                        status for the purpose of paying a maintenance fee, a written assertion of entitlement to
                        small entity status must be filed prior to or with the maintenance fee paid as a small
                        entity. A written assertion is only required to be filed once and will remain effective
                        until changed.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e248968"><b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e327022">37 CFR
                              1.366(f)</a></b> serves as a reminder to patentees of the necessity to check
                        for the loss of small entity status prior to paying each maintenance fee on a patent. This
                        is also a requirement of <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316949">37 CFR 1.27(g)</a></b>. The notification of any
                        change in status resulting in loss of entitlement to small entity status must be filed in a
                        patent prior to paying, or at the time of paying, the earliest maintenance fee due after
                        the date on which status as a small entity is no longer appropriate. If status as a small
                        entity has been previously established by filing an assertion of small entity status and
                        such status is checked and found to be proper, no notification is required. It is not
                        necessary to file a new assertion establishing small entity status at this point if the
                        status as a small entity has been established and is still proper even if rights have been
                        transferred to a small entity after the assertion of small entity status. The requirement
                        is to notify the Office of the loss of entitlement and to pay the maintenance fee in the
                        proper amount for other than a small entity where appropriate. The refund provisions of
                        <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e317241">37
                              CFR 1.28(a)</a></b> for later submitted small entity assertions do apply to
                        maintenance fees.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e248979">If a payment is submitted that
                        conflicts with the Office record of the patenteeâ€™s entity status, a notice relating to
                        entity status will be sent to the fee submitter. A Notice of Overpayment of Patent
                        Maintenance Fee (PTO-211) will be sent if the payment was submitted in the large entity
                        amount, but Office records indicate that the patentee is a small entity. A Notice of
                        Non-Acceptance of Small Entity Patent Maintenance Fee (PTO-2140) will be sent if the
                        payment was submitted in the small entity amount, but Office records indicate that the
                        patentee is a large entity.

                     <p id="d0e248983">Where a Notice of Overpayment of Patent
                        Maintenance Fee (PTO-211) is sent, the time period for reply depends on whether the reply
                        requires additional money for sufficient payment of the large entity maintenance fee. Where
                        no additional money is required, the fee submitter will be given a non-extendable ONE MONTH
                        period from the mailing date of the notice to file a written notification of change in
                        status from small to large entity. Note that if no additional money was required for
                        sufficient payment of the large entity maintenance fee on the date the payment was
                        received, no additional money will be required with the timely reply even if the patent
                        entered the grace period under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e326870">37 CFR 1.362(e)</a></b> after the mailing date
                        of the notice. Where additional money is required, the reply (including the additional
                        money and the written notification of change in status from small to large entity) must be
                        filed within the earlier of: (A) a non-extendable ONE MONTH period from the mailing date of
                        the notice; or (B) any time remaining under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e326870">37&nbsp;CFR 1.362</a></b>,
                        including the grace period provided by <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e326870">37 CFR 1.362(e)</a></b>. Note that if a
                        previously unpaid surcharge has come due by the time the reply requiring additional money
                        is filed, sufficient payment will require payment of the surcharge as well as any
                        additional money required to complete the large entity maintenance fee amount. Absent a
                        timely reply to the Notice of Overpayment of Patent Maintenance Fee (PTO-211), the Office
                        will apply the small entity maintenance fee payment amount to the patent and refund the
                        overpayment amount. Accordingly, if the patentee is actually entitled to small entity
                        status, no reply to the Notice of Overpayment of Patent Maintenance Fee (PTO-211) is
                        necessary. In the event money was refunded by the Office as an 
                        "overpayment amount,"
                        
                        
                         but the patentee is a large
                        entity, provided the patent has not already expired, the fee submitter must file a
                        resubmission of the refunded money together with the required written notification of
                        change in status from small to large entity within the time remaining under

                        by the Office is less than the current amount required for sufficient payment of the large
                        entity maintenance fee, the resubmitted money previously refunded by the Office as an

                        the reply depend on whether the patentee is entitled to small entity status. If the
                        patentee is entitled to small entity status, a written assertion of entitlement to small
                        entity status is required together with any additional money required for sufficient
                        payment of the small entity maintenance fee. If the patentee is a large entity patentee,
                        the reply must include payment of the additional money required for sufficient payment of
