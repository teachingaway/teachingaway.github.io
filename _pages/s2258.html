                                 places refers to prior art in relation to reexamination, <i>see id</i>., it seems apparent that Congress intended that the phrases

                                 a prior patent as a basis for reexamination because maintenance of a patent that
                                 creates double patenting is as much of an imposition on the public as maintenance
                                 of patent that is unpatentable over prior art. Thus, we conclude that the PTO was
                                 authorized during reexamination to consider the question of double patenting based
                                 upon the `762 patent.

                              reexamination, both as a basis for ordering reexamination and during subsequent
                              examination on the merits. The issue of double patenting is to be considered by the

                                 proceeding. The Supreme Court when discussing <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450">35 U.S.C. 103</a></b>
                                 in <i>Graham</i><i>v</i>. <i>John Deere
                                    Co</i>., 383 U.S. 6, 148 USPQ 459 (1966) stated, <i>inter alia</i>, “the scope and content of the prior art
                                 are to be determined.” Accordingly, a proper evaluation of the scope and content
                                 of the prior art in determining obviousness would require a utilization of any
                                 “admission” by the patent owner which can be used to interpret or modify a patent
                                 or printed publication applied in a reexamination proceeding. This is true whether
                                 such admission results from a patent or printed publication or from some other
                                 source. An admission as to what is in the prior art is simply that, an admission,
                                 and requires no independent proof. It is an acknowledged, declared, conceded, or
                                 recognized fact or truth, <i>Ex parte McGaughey</i>,

                                 of the admission may sometimes have to be determined, this can be done from the
                                 record and from the paper file or IFW file history in the same manner as with
                                 patents and printed publications. To ignore an admission by the patent owner, from
                                 any source, and not use the admission as part of the prior art <i>in conjunction with patents and printed publications</i>
                                 in reexamination would make it impossible for the examiner to properly determine

                                 App. &amp; Inter. 1985) which held that admissions which are used as a basis for a
                                 rejection in reexamination must relate to patents and printed
                                 publications.

                                 litigation. Admissions by the patent owner as to any matter affecting

                           evidence may appear in the reexamination request, in the nature of the prior art, in the
                           prosecution history of the prior examination, or in an admission by the patent owner,
                           applicant, or inventor. See 37 CFR 1.104(c)(3).
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e230279">The following examples are intended
                           to be illustrative and not inclusive.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e230282"> For example, if a textbook was
                           cited during prosecution of the application which matured into the patent, the record of
                           that examination may show that only select information from the textbook was discussed
                           with respect to the patentability of the claims. The file history of the prior Office
                           proceeding should indicate which portion of the textbook was previously considered. See
                           37 CFR 1.98(a)(2)(ii) (an information disclosure statement must include a copy of each
                           “publication or that portion which caused it to be listed”). If a subsequent
                           reexamination request relied upon other information in the textbook that actually
                           teaches what is required by the claims, it may be appropriate to rely on this other
                           information in the textbook to order and/or conduct reexamination. However, a
                           reexamination request that merely provides a new interpretation of a reference already
                           previously relied upon or actually discussed by the Office does not create a substantial
                           new question of patentability.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e230285"> Another example involves the
                           situation where an&nbsp;examiner discussed a reference in a prior Office proceeding, but did
                           not either reject a claim based upon the reference or maintain the rejection based on
                           the mistaken belief that the reference did not qualify as prior art. For example, the
                           examiner may not have believed that the reference qualified as prior art because: (i)
                           the reference was undated or was believed to have a bad date; (ii) the applicant
                           submitted a declaration believed to be sufficient to antedate the reference under
                           <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323512">37 CFR
                                 1.131(a)</a></b>; or (iii) the examiner attributed an incorrect filing
                           date to the claimed invention. If the reexamination request were to explain how and why
                           the reference actually does qualify as prior art, it may be appropriate to rely on the
                           reference to order and/or conduct reexamination. For example, the request could: (i)
                           verify the date of the reference; (ii) undermine the sufficiency of the declaration
                           filed under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323512">37 CFR
                                 1.131(a)</a></b> (by a showing of an inaccuracy/mistake of fact in the
                           declaration); or (iii) explain the correct filing date accorded a claim where the issue
                           was not previously addressed in an earlier examination of the patent. See e.g., <i>Heinl v. Godici</i>, 143 F. Supp.2d 593 (E.D.Va. 2001)
                           (reexamination on the basis of art previously presented without adequate proof of date
                           may proceed if prior art status is now established).
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e230299">Another example involves foreign
                           language prior art references. If a foreign language prior art reference was cited and
                           discussed in any prior Office proceeding but the foreign language prior art reference
                           was&nbsp;never completely and accurately translated into English during the original
                           prosecution, <i>Portola Packaging</i> may not prohibit
                           reexamination over a complete and accurate translation of that foreign language prior
                           art reference. Specifically, if a reexamination request were to explain why a more
                           complete and accurate translation of that same foreign language prior art reference
                           actually teaches what is required by the patent claims, it may be appropriate to rely on
                           the foreign language prior art reference to order and/or conduct
                           reexamination.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e230305"> Another example of an unusual fact
                           pattern involves cumulative references. To the extent that a cumulative reference is
                           repetitive of a prior art reference that was previously applied or discussed, <i>Portola Packaging</i> may prohibit reexamination of the patent
                           claims based only on the repetitive reference. For purposes of reexamination, a
                           cumulative reference that is repetitive is one that substantially reiterates verbatim
                           the teachings of a reference that was either previously relied upon or discussed in a
                           prior Office proceeding even though the title or the citation of the reference may be
                           different. However, it is expected that a repetitive reference which cannot be
                           considered by the Office during reexamination will be a rare occurrence since most
                           references teach additional information or present information in a different way than
                           other references, even though the references might address the same general subject
                           matter.
