                        of a license is not immediate or even ensured. If the application is not marked by the
                        security screeners, the petition is granted. This is indicated to the applicant by the
                        presence on the filing receipt of the phrase “Foreign Filing License Granted” and a date.
                        The license becomes effective on the date shown. Further,&nbsp;grant of this license is made of
                        record in the application file. The scope of this license is quite broad as set forth in

                        </h2>
                        <p id="d0e4287">A petition for a retroactive filing
                           license may be filed under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e337707">37 CFR 5.25</a></b> if an unlicensed foreign
                           filing has occurred through error. However, the requirements of <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e337707">37 CFR 5.25</a></b> must
                           be fulfilled in order for such a petition to be granted. Note that for petitions filed
                           prior to September 16, 2012, the petition must specify that the error occurred without
                           deceptive intent (see <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e337715">pre-AIA 37 CFR 5.25(a)(3)(iii) and
                                 (b)</a></b>). Licenses under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e337707">37 CFR 5.25</a></b> are only made
                           retroactive with respect to specific acts of foreign filing, and therefore the
                           countries, the actual dates of filing and the establishing of the nature of the error
                           must be provided for each act of proscribed foreign filing for which a retroactive
                           license is sought. Also, the required verified statement must be in oath or declaration
                           form.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e4300">Upon written notification from the
                           USPTO, any foreign filing license required by <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e337342">37 CFR 5.11(a)</a></b> may be
                           revoked. Ordinarily, revocation indicates that additional review of the licensed subject
                           matter revealed the need for referral of the application to the appropriate defense
                           agencies. Revocation of a filing receipt license (<b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e337427">37 CFR 5.12(a)</a></b>) does
                           not necessarily mean that a petition under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e337427">37&nbsp;CFR 5.12(b)</a></b> for a
                           license of narrower scope will not be granted. The revocation becomes effective on the
                           date on which the notice is mailed. Foreign filings, which occurred prior to revocation,
                           need not be abandoned or otherwise specially treated; however, additional filings
                           without a license are not permitted unless 6 months have elapsed from the filing of any
                           corresponding U.S. application. Papers and other documents needed in support of
                           prosecution of foreign applications may be sent abroad if they comply with any pertinent
                           export regulations. Of course, if and once a Secrecy Order is issued, the restrictions
                           thereof must immediately be observed.

                           will cause revocation of the authority which arises from <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e304599">35 U.S.C.
                                 184</a></b> to file a foreign patent application 6 months or later after
                           the date of filing of a corresponding U.S. patent application.

                           fine or imprisonment. Petitions for retroactive foreign filing licenses are processed by
                           Licensing and Review and decided by the Office of Petitions. If applicant also wishes an
                           expedited license for future filings, a separate expedited license request must be filed
                           with Licensing and Review.
