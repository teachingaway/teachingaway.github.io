                           may respond to such Office action with or without amendment, and the third party
                           requester may provide comments after the patent owner’s response. If the patent owner

                           or Technology Center (TC) Quality Assurance Specialist (QAS) for review. If the CRU
                           SPRS/TC QAS returns the case to the examiner for correction/revision, the

                              response, and possibly the third party requester comments, the space on the PTOL-2065
                              for the date of the communication(s) to which the Office action is responsive to
                              should be filled in. Generally, the patent owner is given one month to respond to the
                              action, and thus “One” should be inserted in the appropriate space for
                              such.

                              impact on patentability. Review of the patentability of the claims by more than one
                              primary examiner should diminish any perception that the patent owner can
                              disproportionately influence the examiner in charge of the proceeding. The
                              conferences will also provide greater assurance that all matters will be addressed
                              appropriately. All issues in the proceeding will be viewed from the perspectives of
                              three examiners. What the examiner in charge of the proceeding might have missed, one
                              of the other two conference members would likely detect. The conference will provide

                              action issued, or the challenge will not be considered. In no event will the failure
