                           presented in the declaration, the Office is likely to count the declaration, including
                           the supporting exhibit, as a single item of information. If, however, the declaration

                           receipts as evidence of a potential sale of the invention (<i>e.g</i>., a
                           sales receipt dated March 2011, and a second, separate sales receipt dated October 2011,
                           which provides evidence of a second, separate sale of the invention), then each
                           additional sales receipt will be counted separately, resulting in two items of
                           information (one item consisting of the declaration and one sales receipt, and the
                           second item consisting of the second sales receipt). As another example, if the
                           declaration relies not only upon a sales receipt (e.g., exhibit 1) as evidence of a sale
                           of the invention under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_234ed_52">35 U.S.C. 102</a></b>, but also upon a
                           reference patent (e.g., exhibit 2) as evidence of a potential ground under

                              information to be corrected involves, for example, the common ownership of the claims,
                              the patent owner should include with the request one or more additional items of
                              information that cause(s) the patentability of the claims to depend upon the common
                              ownership issue, such any prior art or other documents or information that caused the
                              patent owner to reconsider the common ownership of the claims.
