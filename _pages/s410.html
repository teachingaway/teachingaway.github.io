                           pleadings, written motions, and other documents, and prescribing sanctions for
                           violations of these obligations. The [1993] revision in part expands the

                           flexibility in dealing with infractions of the rule. The rule continues to require
                           litigants to “stop-and-think” before initially making legal or factual contentions. It
                           also, however, emphasizes the duty of candor by subjecting litigants to potential
                           sanctions for insisting upon a position after it is no longer tenable and by generally
                           providing protection against sanctions if they withdraw or correct contentions after a
                           potential violation is called to their attention.

                        <p id="d0e24082">The rule applies only to assertions
                           contained in papers filed with or submitted to the court. It does not cover matters
                           arising for the first time during oral presentations to the court, when counsel may make
                           statements that would not have been made if there had been more time for study and
                           reflection. However, a litigant's obligations with respect to the contents of these
                           papers are not measured solely as of the time they are filed with or submitted to the
                           court, but include reaffirming to the court and advocating positions contained in those
                           pleadings and motions after learning that they cease to have any merit. For example, an
                           attorney who during a pretrial conference insists on a claim or defense should be viewed
                           as “presenting to the court” that contention and would be subject to the obligations of
                           [Rule 11(b)] measured as of that time. Similarly, if after a notice of removal is filed,
                           a party urges in federal court the allegations of a pleading filed in state court
                           (whether as claims, defenses, or in disputes regarding removal or remand), it would be
                           viewed as “presenting”-- and hence certifying to the district court under Rule 11--those
                           allegations.

                           allegations and other factual contentions is revised in recognition that sometimes a
                           litigant may have good reason to believe that a fact is true or false but may need
                           discovery, formal or informal, from opposing parties or third persons to gather and
                           confirm the evidentiary basis for the allegation. Tolerance of factual contentions in
                           initial pleadings by plaintiffs or defendants when specifically identified as made on
                           information and belief does not relieve litigants from the obligation to conduct an
                           appropriate investigation into the facts that is reasonable under the circumstances; it
                           is not a license to join parties, make claims, or present defenses without any factual
                           basis or justification. Moreover, if evidentiary support is not obtained after a
                           reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery, the party has a duty
                           under the rule not to persist with that contention. [Rule 11(b)] does not require a
                           formal amendment to pleadings for which evidentiary support is not obtained, but rather
                           calls upon a litigant not thereafter to advocate such claims or
                           defenses.

                        <p id="d0e24088">The certification is that there is
                           (or likely will be) “evidentiary support” for the allegation, not that the party will
                           prevail with respect to its contention regarding the fact. That summary judgment is
                           rendered against a party does not necessarily mean, for purposes of this certification,
                           that it had no evidentiary support for its position. On the other hand, if a party has
                           evidence with respect to a contention that would suffice to defeat a motion for summary
                           judgment based thereon, it would have sufficient “evidentiary support” for purposes of
                           Rule 11.

                           involve somewhat different considerations. Often, of course, a denial is premised upon
                           the existence of evidence contradicting the alleged fact. At other times a denial is
                           permissible because, after an appropriate investigation, a party has no information
                           concerning the matter or, indeed, has a reasonable basis for doubting the credibility of
                           the only evidence relevant to the matter. A party should not deny an allegation it knows
                           to be true; but it is not required, simply because it lacks contradictory evidence, to
                           admit an allegation that it believes is not true.

                        <p id="d0e24094">The changes in [Rule 11(b)(3) and
                           (4)] will serve to equalize the burden of the rule upon plaintiffs and defendants, who
                           under Rule 8(b) are in effect allowed to deny allegations by stating that from their
                           initial investigation they lack sufficient information to form a belief as to the truth
                           of the allegation. If, after further investigation or discovery, a denial is no longer
                           warranted, the defendant should not continue to insist on that denial. While sometimes
                           helpful, formal amendment of the pleadings to withdraw an allegation or denial is not
                           required by [Rule 11(b)].

                           standard, intended to eliminate any “empty-head pure-heart” justification for patently
                           frivolous arguments. However, to the extent to which a litigant has researched the
                           issues and found some support for its theories even in minority opinions, in law review
                           articles, or through consultation with other attorneys should certainly be taken into
                           account in determining whether [Rule 11(b)(2)] has been violated. Although arguments for
                           a change in law are not required to be specifically so identified, a contention that is
                           so identified should be viewed with greater tolerance under [Rule 11].
