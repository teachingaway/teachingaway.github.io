                        considered with regard to claim 1, will generally be limited to whether any of the three

                        with respect to claim 1. If the patent owner wishes to request consideration of an item of
                        information with respect to multiple claims of the patent, the request for supplemental
                        examination must include an identification of each claim in view of which the item of
                        information is to be considered, and the required detailed explanation with respect to each
                        claim. For example, if the patent owner fails to request that the Office consider certain

                           examination

                           explanation was not provided. For example, if the patent owner requests supplemental
                           examination of claims 1-10 in view of the Fisher article, but only provides a separate,
                           detailed explanation of the manner of applying the Fisher article to claims 1-5, then
                           the patent owner is not entitled to a determination on claims 6-10, for which the

                        <p id="ch2800_d1fefd_27259_36c">As a general rule, the Office will analyze a
                           claim for which supplemental examination is requested only in light of the item(s) of
                           information identified for that claim. For example, if the patent owner requests
                           supplemental examination of claim 1 in light of three items of information, and requests
                           supplemental examination of claim 5 in light of two other items of information, the
                           Office will analyze, in general, only claim 1 in light of the three items of information
                           identified for claim 1, and only claim 5 in light of the two items of information
                           identified for claim 5. The examiner, however, has the discretion to determine whether
                           any of the items of information properly submitted with the request raises a
                           SNQ
                           affecting any of the claims for which supplemental examination is requested. Based on
                           the facts given in the above example, the examiner has the option to determine whether
                           any of the five items of information provided with the request raises a
                           SNQ
                           affecting either claim 1 or claim 5. In other words, the examiner has the
                           <i>option</i> of analyzing the items of information provided with the
                           request with respect to any of the claims for which supplemental examination is
                           requested, in a manner other than that provided by the patent owner in the request. The
                           patent owner, however, is not
                           <i> entitled</i> to a determination on a claim for which
                           the required explanation under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1d8bb_13e68_2ca">37 CFR 1.610(b)(5)</a></b> has not been

                              benefit claim. The request includes, as an item of information, an intervening
                              reference which caused the patent owner to reconsider the effective filing date of
                              the claims, and which would pre-date the effective filing date of the patent to be
                              examined, if the domestic benefit claim is deleted. The request also includes a
                              detailed explanation of how the intervening reference may be applied to the patent
                              claims if the domestic benefit claim is deleted. See <b><a href="s2811.html#ch2800_d1fefc_2ae06_c1">MPEP §
                                    2811.01</a></b>, subsection III. In this case, the examiner would
                              determine whether the intervening reference would raise a SNQ affecting the
                              identified claims of the patent if the domestic benefit claim is deleted and the
                              effective filing date of the patent to be examined <b id=""><span class="Underline">is
                                    corrected</span></b> to an appropriate later filing date. If the
                              examiner determines that the intervening reference does not raise a SNQ, then the
                              examiner will issue a supplemental examination certificate indicating that no SNQ is
                              raised by the request. If the examiner determines that the intervening reference
                              raises a SNQ, then the examiner will issue a supplemental examination certificate
                              indicating that a SNQ affecting at least one claim of the patent is raised in the
                              request. Reexamination will be ordered, and the domestic benefit claim may be
                              corrected during the resulting reexamination proceeding. Patent owners are reminded,
                              however, that the deletion of the domestic benefit claim in this example will not
                              operate to extend the term of the patent. See <b><a href="s2809.html#ch2800_d1fef5_19b6f_352">MPEP §

                                    patent, and the examiner finds that a substantial new question of patentability
