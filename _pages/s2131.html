                                 incorporating a bag containing DEHP, an additive to the plastic which improved the
                                 bag’s red blood cell storage capability. The examiner rejected the claims over a
                                 technical progress report by Becker which taught the same blood bag system but did
                                 not expressly disclose the presence of DEHP. The report, however, did disclose
                                 using commercial blood bags. It also disclosed the blood bag system as “very
                                 similar to [Baxter] Travenol’s commercial two bag blood container.” Extrinsic
                                 evidence (depositions, declarations and Baxter Travenol’s own admissions) showed

                                 DEHP. Therefore, one of ordinary skill in the art would have known that

                                 water-in-oil emulsions with identical ingredients to those claimed, in&nbsp;overlapping
                                 ranges with the claimed composition. The only element of the claims arguably not
                                 present in the prior&nbsp;art compositions was “sufficient aeration . . . entrapped to

                              to arrive at a specific composition, anticipation can only be found if the classes of

                              the prior art disclosed a generic chemical formula “wherein X, Y, Z, P, and
                              R<sup>'</sup>- represent either hydrogen or alkyl
                              radicals, R a side chain containing an OH group.” The court held that this formula,
                              without more, could not anticipate a claim to 7-methyl-9-[d, l<sup>'</sup>-ribityl]-isoalloxazine because the generic
                              formula encompassed a vast number and perhaps even an infinite number of compounds.
                              However, the reference also disclosed preferred substituents for X, Y, Z, P, R, and
                              R<sup>'</sup> as follows: where X, P, and
                              R<sup>'</sup> are hydrogen, where Y and Z may be
                              hydrogen or methyl, and where R is one of eight specific isoalloxazines. The court
                              determined that this more limited generic class consisted of about 20 compounds. The
                              limited number of compounds covered by the preferred formula in combination with the
                              fact that the number of substituents was low at each site, the ring positions were
                              limited, and there was a large unchanging structural nucleus, resulted in a finding
                              that the reference sufficiently described “each of the various permutations here
                              involved as fully as if he had drawn each structural formula or had written each
                              name.” The claimed compound was 1 of these 20&nbsp;compounds. Therefore, the reference
                              “described” the claimed compound and the reference anticipated the
                              claims.
