                        Supporting a Rejection Under 35 U.S.C. 103  [R-08.2012]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="">When considering obviousness, Office personnel are cautioned against treating
                        any line of reasoning as a per se rule. This section discusses supporting a rejection under
                        <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450">35 U.S.C.
                              103</a></b> by reliance on scientific theory and legal precedent. In keeping
                        with the flexible approach to obviousness under KSR, as well as the requirement for
                        explanation, Office personnel may invoke legal precedent as a source of supporting
                        rationale when warranted and appropriately supported. See <b><a href="s2144.html#d0e210929">MPEP § 2144.04</a></b>. So, for
                        example, automating a manual activity, making portable, making separable, reversing or
                        duplicating parts, or purifying an old product may form the basis of a rejection. However,
                        such rationales should not be treated as per se rules, but rather must be explained and
                        shown to apply to the facts at hand. A similar caveat applies to any obviousness analysis.
                        Simply stating the principle (e.g., “art recognized equivalent,” “structural similarity”)
                        without providing an explanation of its applicability to the facts of the case at hand is
                        generally not sufficient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of obviousness.

                              (Applicant argued that the prior art taught away from use of a protective layer for a
                              reflective article having a thickness within the claimed range of “50 to 100
                              Angstroms.” Specifically, a patent to Zehender, which was relied upon to reject
                              applicant’s claim, included a statement that the thickness of the protective layer
                              “should be not less than about [100 Angstroms].” The court held that the patent did
                              not teach away from the claimed invention. “Zehender suggests that there are benefits
                              to be derived from keeping the protective layer as thin as possible, consistent with
                              achieving adequate protection. A thinner coating reduces light absorption and
                              minimizes manufacturing time and expense. Thus, while Zehender expresses a preference
                              for a thicker protective layer of 200-300 Angstroms, at the same time it provides the
                              motivation for one of ordinary skill in the art to focus on thickness levels at the
                              bottom of Zehender’s ‘suitable’ range- about 100 Angstroms- and to explore thickness
                              levels below that range. The statement in Zehender that ‘[i]n general, the thickness
                              of the protective layer should be not less than about [100 Angstroms]’ falls far
                              short of the kind of teaching that would discourage one of skill in the art from
                              fabricating a protective layer of 100 Angstroms or less. [W]e are therefore ‘not
                              convinced that there was a sufficient teaching away in the art to overcome [the]
                              strong case of obviousness’ made out by Zehender.”). See <b><a href="s2145.html#d0e212553">MPEP §

                              1225, 1228 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The court found that patentee offered neither evidence
                              of teaching away of the prior art nor new and unexpected results of the claimed
                              invention drawn to a weight plate having 3 elongated handle openings. 392 F.3d at
                              1323, 73 USPQ2d at 1229. The court then turned to considering substantial evidence of
                              pertinent secondary factors such as commercial success, satisfaction of a long-felt
                              need, and copying by others may also support patentability. <i>Id.</i> Nevertheless, the court found that <i>Iron
                                 Grip</i> failed to show evidence of commercial success, copying by others,
                              or satisfaction of a long felt need for the following reasons: (A) <i>Iron Grip’s</i> licensing of its patent to three
                              competitors was insufficient to show nexus between the “merits of the invention and
                              the licenses,” and thus did not establish secondary consideration of commercial
                              success; (B) in response to <i>Iron Grip’s </i> argument
                              that the competitor’s production of a three-hole plate is evidence of copying, the
                              court stated that “[n]ot every competing product that falls within the scope of a
                              patent is evidence of copying” since “[o]therwise every infringement suit would
                              automatically confirm the nonobviousness of the patent;” and (C) although <i>Iron Grip</i> offered as evidence that the absence of the
                              three-grip plate on the market prior to its patent showed that the invention was
                              nonobviousness, the court stated that “[a]bsent a showing of a long-felt need or the
                              failure of others, the mere passage of time without the claimed invention is not
                              evidence of nonobviousness.” 392 F.3d at 1324-25, 73&nbsp;USPQ2d at

                                       bearing in mind that size alone cannot support an obviousness rejection.

                                          Baird,</i> 16 F.3d at 383, 29 USPQ2d at 1552 (observing that “it is
                                       not the mere number of compounds in this limited class which is significant
                                       here but, rather, the total circumstances involved”). There is no absolute
                                       correlation between the size of the prior art genus and a conclusion of
                                       obviousness. <i>Id.</i> Thus, the mere fact
                                       that a prior art genus contains a small number of members does not create a
                                       <i>per se</i> rule of obviousness. However,
                                       a genus may be so small that, when considered in light of the totality of
                                       the circumstances, it would anticipate the claimed species or subgenus. For
                                       example, it has been held that a prior art genus containing only 20
                                       compounds and a limited number of variations in the generic chemical formula
                                       inherently anticipated a claimed species within the genus because “one
                                       skilled in [the] art would... envisage <i>each

                                          find in Karrer contains only 20 compounds. However, we wish to point out
                                          that it is not the mere number of compounds in this limited class which
                                          is significant here but, rather, the total circumstances involved,

                              reference which taught 5- and 6-membered ring homologs of the claimed compounds. The
                              Board reversed the rejection because the prior art taught that the compounds
                              containing a 5-membered ring possessed the opposite utility of the compounds
                              containing the 6-membered ring, undermining the examiner’s asserted <i>prima facie</i> case arising from an expectation of similar
                              results in the claimed compounds which contain a 7-membered ring.).
