                              extends the time for reply to the date corresponding to the Office action date in the
                              following month. For example, a reply to an Office action mailed on January 31 with a
                              3-month shortened statutory period would be due on April 30. If a 1-month extension
                              of time were given, the reply would be due by May 31. The fact that April 30 may have
                              been a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday has no effect on the extension of time.

                              should be signed by the person granting or denying the extension, and the name and
                              title of that person should also appear in the notation on the copy which is returned
                              to the person requesting the extension.

                                 an extension of time, stating as a reason therefor that more time is needed in
                                 which to submit an affidavit. When such a request is filed after final rejection,
                                 the granting of the request for extension of time is without prejudice to the
                                 right of the examiner to question why the affidavit is now necessary and why it
                                 was not earlier presented. If applicantโs showing is insufficient, the examiner
                                 may deny entry of the affidavit, notwithstanding the previous grant of an
                                 extension of time to submit it. The grant of an extension of time in these
                                 circumstances serves merely to keep the application from becoming abandoned while

                                 appropriate action. Moreover, prosecution of the application to save it from

                              be reset due to delay in the mail or in the Office. However, when a substantial
                              portion of the set reply period had elapsed on the date of receipt at the
                              correspondence address (e.g., at least 1 month of a 2- or 3-month period had
                              elapsed), the procedures set forth above for late receipt of action are available.
                              Where an Office action was received with less than 2 months remaining in a shortened
                              statutory period of 3 months the period may be restarted from the date of receipt.
                              Where the period remaining is between 2 and 3 months, the period will be reset only
                              in extraordinary situations, e.g., complex Office action suggesting submission of
