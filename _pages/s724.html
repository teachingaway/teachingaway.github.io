                        necessary, or desirable, for parties to proceedings in the Patent and Trademark Office
                        relating to pending patent applications or reexamination proceedings to submit to the
                        Office trade secret, proprietary, and/or protective order materials. Such materials may
                        include those which are subject to a protective or secrecy order issued by a court or by
                        the International Trade Commission (ITC). While one submitting materials to the Office in
                        relation to a pending patent application or reexamination proceeding must generally assume
                        that such materials will be made of record in the file and be made public, the Office is
                        not unmindful of the difficulties this sometimes imposes. The Office is also cognizant of
                        the sentiment expressed by the court in <i>In re Sarkar,</i>
                        575 F.2d 870, 872, 197 USPQ 788, 791&nbsp;(CCPA 1978), which stated:

                           <i>most</i> benefited by the early disclosure of the
                           invention in consideration of the patent grant. If a patent applicant is unwilling to
                           pursue his right to a patent at the risk of certain loss of trade secret protection, the
                           two systems will conflict, the public will be deprived of knowledge of the invention in
                           many cases, and inventors will be reluctant to bring unsettled legal questions of
                           significant current interest . . . for resolution.
