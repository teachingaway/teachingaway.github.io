                        earlier foreign or United States patent application whose filing date is claimed. For
                        example, the effective date of some of the claims in a patent which resulted from a

                        upheld a nonstatutory double patenting rejection in which the patent upon which the
                        rejection was based and the patent under reexamination shared the same effective filing

                           cited patents or printed publications are applied to all claims which requester
                           considers to merit reexamination. This not only sets forth the requester’s position to
                           the Office, but also to the patent owner (where the patent owner is not the requester).
                           A request for reexamination, including the citation form (form on which the references
                           are listed), must not include citations to background references or other references
                           which are not used to support a SNQ or proposed rejection of the claims, and explained
                           in the request as to providing such support. Without explanation for each of the
                           references the request seeks to make of record, the request lacks the requisite

                           documents as to patent claims 1-10 (for example), the request must explain how each of
                           the proposed combinations specifically applies to each claim that it is asserted against
                           (i.e., claims 1 – 10), explaining how each document (reference) identified for the
