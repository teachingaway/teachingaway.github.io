                           revive the abandoned application on the basis of unintentional delay, and not on the
                           basis of unavoidable delay. See <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323989">37 CFR 1.137(f)</a></b>. By statute, such a
                           petition to revive requires payment of the petition fee specified in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#eff_20130320_d0e315732">37 CFR

                        <p id="d0e120800">Abandonment occurs by operation of
                           the statute, and the Office is unlikely to recognize when applicant has filed a
                           counterpart application in a foreign country or under a multilateral agreement contrary
                           to their certification to the Office. The Office would not be able to change the status
                           of the application from pending to abandoned in the PALM system and send applicant a
                           notice of abandonment. As a result, if applicant failed to file a notice of foreign
                           filing when it was required, prosecution of the application will continue and the
                           application may issue as a patent, even though the application has become abandoned by
                           operation of the statute. Applicants who determine that a required notice of foreign
                           filing was not timely provided should promptly file a petition to revive under

                           operate to stay any period for reply that may be running against the
