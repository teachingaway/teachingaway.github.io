                              that Schreiber’s container is of a ‘different shape’ than Harz’s [patent]. In fact, [
                              ] an embodiment according to Harz (Fig. 5) and the embodiment depicted in Fig. 1 of
                              Schreiber’s application have the same general shape. For that reason, the examiner
                              was justified in concluding that the opening of a conically shaped top as disclosed
                              by Harz is inherently of a size sufficient to ‘allow [ ] several kernels of popped
                              popcorn to pass through at the same time’ and that the taper of Harz’s conically
                              shaped top is inherently of such a shape ‘as to by itself jam up the popped popcorn
                              before the end of the cone and permit the dispensing of only a few kernels at a shake
                              of a package when the top is mounted to the container.’ The examiner therefore
                              correctly found that Harz established a prima facie case of
                              anticipation.

                           the claims were directed to a self-locking screw-threaded fastener comprising a metallic
                           threaded fastener having patches of crystallizable thermoplastic bonded thereto. The
                           claim further specified that the thermoplastic had a reduced degree of crystallization
                           shrinkage. The specification disclosed that the locking fastener was made by heating the
                           metal fastener to melt a thermoplastic blank which is pressed against the metal. After
                           the thermoplastic adheres to the metal fastener, the end product is cooled by quenching
                           in water. The examiner made a rejection based on a U.S. patent to Barnes. Barnes taught
                           a self-locking fastener in which the patch of thermoplastic was made by depositing
                           thermoplastic powder on a metallic fastener which was then heated. The end product was
                           cooled in ambient air, by cooling air or by contacting the fastener with a water trough.
                           The court first noted that the two fasteners were identical or only slightly different
                           from each other. “Both fasteners possess the same utility, employ the same
                           crystallizable polymer (nylon 11), and have an adherent plastic patch formed by melting
                           and then cooling the polymer.” <i>Id.</i> at 596 n.1, 619
                           F.2d at 70 n.l. The court then noted that the Board had found that Barnes’ cooling rate
                           could reasonably be expected to result in a polymer possessing the claimed
                           crystallization shrinkage rate. Applicants had not rebutted this finding with evidence
                           that the shrinkage rate was indeed different. They had only argued that the
                           crystallization shrinkage rate was dependent on the cool down rate and that the cool
                           down rate of Barnes was much slower than theirs. Because a difference in the cool down
                           rate does not necessarily result in a difference in shrinkage, objective evidence was
                           required to rebut the <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383">35&nbsp;U.S.C. 102</a></b>/<b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450">103</a></b><i>prima facie </i>case.

                           declaration failed to overcome a <i>prima facie</i> case of
                           anticipation because the declaration did not specify the dimensions of either the
                           dispensing top that was tested or the popcorn that was used. Applicant’s declaration
                           merely asserted that a conical dispensing top built according to a figure in the prior
                           art patent was too small to jam and dispense popcorn and thus could not inherently
                           perform the functions recited in applicant’s claims. The court pointed out the
                           disclosure of the prior art patent was not limited to use as an oil can dispenser, but
                           rather was broader than the precise configuration shown in the patent’s figure. The
                           court also noted that the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences found as a factual
                           matter that a scaled-up version of the top disclosed in the patent would be capable of
                           performing the functions recited in applicant’s claim.

                              device, in its normal and usual operation, would necessarily perform the method
                              claimed, then the method claimed will be considered to be anticipated by the prior
                              art device. When the prior art device is the same as a device described in the
                              specification for carrying out the claimed method, it can be assumed the device will
                              inherently perform the claimed process. <i>In re

                              directed to a method of enhancing color effects produced by ambient light through a
                              process of absorption and reflection of the light off a coated substrate. A prior art
                              reference to <i>Donley</i> disclosed a glass substrate
                              coated with silver and metal oxide 200-800 angstroms thick. While Donley disclosed
                              using the coated substrate to produce architectural colors, the absorption and
                              reflection mechanisms of the claimed process were not disclosed. However, King’s
                              specification disclosed using a coated substrate of Donley’s structure for use in his
                              process. The Federal Circuit upheld the Board’s finding that 
                              "Donley inherently performs the function disclosed in the method

                              Donley's structure would not perform the claimed method when placed in ambient

                              hydrolytically-stable zeolitic aluminosilicate which included a step of “cooling the
                              steam zeolite ... at a rate sufficiently rapid that the cooled zeolite exhibits a
                              X-ray diffraction pattern ....” All the process limitations were expressly disclosed
                              by a U.S. patent to Hansford except the cooling step. The court stated that any
                              sample of Hansford’s zeolite would necessarily be cooled to facilitate subsequent
                              handling. Therefore, a <i>prima facie</i> case under

                              or any data showing that the process of Hansford would result in a product with a
                              different X-ray diffraction. Either type of evidence would have rebutted the <i>prima facie </i>case under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383">35 U.S.C.

                              The Board noted that applicant had stated in the specification that Wisconsin 526
