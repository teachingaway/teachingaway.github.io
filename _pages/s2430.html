                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e247757">In those areas of biotechnology in
                        which nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence information is significant, many patent
                        applicants are accustomed to, or familiar with, the submission of such sequence
                        information, in electronic form, to various sequence databases, such as GenBank, which is
                        produced by the National Institutes of Health. In order to facilitate such submissions, or
                        merely for the purpose of researching and developing sequence information, many eventual
                        patent applicants also generate or encode sequence&nbsp;information in computer readable form.
                        In order to further facilitate compliance with the sequence rules, the Office previously
                        made available to the public an input program based on the AuthorIn program produced by
                        GenBank. This input program, called PatentIn version 1.3, was specifically tailored to the
                        requirements of the sequence rules which were in effect between October 1, 1990 and July 1,
                        1998.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e247760">The current sequence rules, which are
                        embodied in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333653">37 CFR 1.821</a></b>-<b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e334511">1.825</a></b> and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Standard
                        ST.25, became effective July 1, 1998. The rules simplify the Sequence&nbsp;Listing requirements,
                        and harmonize the format among all Trilateral Offices and many other patent offices around
                        the world. The Office deployed PatentIn versions 2.0 and 2.1, in 1998 and 1999,
                        respectively, incorporating changes in the required format for the Sequence Listing to
                        ensure compliance with the sequence rules that became effective July 1, 1998. These
                        versions operated under Microsoft Windows 3.1x, 95, 98 and NT. By using PatentIn version
                        2.0 or 2.1, customers were able to generate a Sequence Listing once and use that same
                        listing to file at multiple patent offices worldwide. Applications filed in the U.S. after
                        July 1, 1998 containing Sequence Listings prepared using PatentIn version 1.3 will not be
                        in compliance with the U.S. sequence rules. Applications filed in the member countries of
                        WIPO after July 1, 1998 containing Sequence Listings prepared using PatentIn version 1.3
                        will not be in compliance with ST.25. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e247769">In June 2000 another update of PatentIn
                        was deployed, version 3.0. This version differs from earlier versions in that the
                        capabilities have been extended. PatentIn 3.0 has several advantages over PatentIn 2.1.
                        PatentIn 3.0 processes large sequences (over one million bases) and applications with a
                        large number of sequences (over 100,000); it imports multiple sequences from a single file
                        as well as multiple sequences from multiple files. Features defined for nucleic acid
                        sequences are carried over to the supplemental amino acid sequences generated by the
                        CDS&nbsp;feature. PatentIn 3.0 is more user-friendly than PatentIn 2.1 and looks and feels more
                        like other Windows-based programs. Unlike PatentIn 2.1, projects are portable from one
                        computer to another provided PatentIn 3.0 is installed. From a programming viewpoint, the
                        advantages include that the overall lines of code have been reduced to 25 percent of that
                        required by PatentIn 2.1, maintenance of the code is easier since it is written in Visual
                        C++ and it is easier to modify the code. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e247772">In March of 2001 PatentIn 3.1 was
                        released. This newest version builds on the success of PatentIn 3.0 and expands its
                        capabilities. One difference is that the capability to import a single sequence from a
                        single file without a header has been added. The definition of variable characters has been
                        enhanced in PatentIn 3.1. If the nucleotide sequence has the variable “n” and the CDS
                        feature is selected, PatentIn 3.1 will calculate the position of the necessary Xaa in the
                        supplemental protein sequence and provide the definition automatically based on the codon
                        in which the “n” appears. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e247775">PatentIn version 3.1, and the companion
                        User’s Manual, are available on the Office World Wide Web site (www.uspto.gov) for free
                        downloading. Copies of both the program and the user manual may also be purchased from the
                        Office on 3 1/2-inch floppy diskette or compact disc. PatentIn 3.1 operates in a Windows
                        95/98/NT/2000 environment and has similar space, memory and system requirements as those
                        for PatentIn version 3.0. A minimum of 64 MB of memory is recommended for smaller projects.
                        Otherwise 128 MB is recommended. Even more additional memory may be required for larger
                        sequence listings. The disk space required to install PatentIn 3.0 is 1.6 MB. Additional
                        disk space is required to store project files and sequence listing files.

                     <p id="d0e247778">See <b><a href="s1730.html#d0e163385">MPEP §
                              1730</a></b> for additional information regarding ordering and using
                        PatentIn.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e247784">While use of the PatentIn program is
                        not required for compliance with the sequence rules, its use is highly recommended as
                        Office experience has shown that submissions developed with PatentIn are far less likely to
                        include errors than those developed without the program. The many automatic features of the
                        PatentIn program also greatly ease the generation of Sequence Listings when compared to
                        generating them by hand in a word processing environment. This is especially true for
                        Sequence Listings that include many sequences and/or sequences having great lengths.

                     <p id="d0e247787">The Office provides hands-on training
                        in the use of the PatentIn and associated utilities programs. The classes are held in
                        Washington D.C. as demand warrants. In addition, on site training may be arranged at
                        locations outside Washington, D.C. To express interest in such classes, please contact the
