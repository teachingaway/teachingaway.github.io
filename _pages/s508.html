                           copy of the missing document. While the Office will generally treat missing documents in
                           this relatively informal manner (rather than issuing a notice under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e325620">37 CFR

                           informal attempts to obtain a copy of the document are unsuccessful. The notice under

                           submitted with the application. Since the Office can obtain copies of U.S. patent

                           adverse impact during attempts to enforce the patent). In addition, if the patent is
