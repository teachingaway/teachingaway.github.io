                        request for reexamination, the examiner must request a litigation search from the Technical
                        Support Staff (TSS) of the Central Reexamination Unit (CRU) or the Scientific and Technical
                        Information Center (STIC) to check if the patent has been, or is, involved in litigation.
                        The “Litigation Review” box on the reexamination IFW file jacket form (RXFILJKT) should be
                        completed to indicate that the review was conducted and the results thereof. A copy of the
                        litigation search and the reexamination file jacket form are scanned into the IFW
                        reexamination file history. In the rare instance where the record of the reexamination
                        proceeding or the litigation search indicates that additional information is desirable,
                        guidance as to making an additional litigation search may be obtained from the library of
                        the Office of the Solicitor. If the patent is or was involved in litigation, and a paper
                        referring to the court proceeding has been filed, reference to the paper by number should
                        be made in the “Litigation Review” box on the reexamination IFW file jacket form as, for
                        example, “litigation; see paper filed 7-14-2005. If a litigation records search is already
                        noted on the file, the examiner need not repeat or update it.

                     <p id="d0e225129">The decision on the request for
                        reexamination has as its object either the granting or denial of an order for
                        reexamination. This decision is based on whether or not “a substantial new question of
                        patentability” is found. A determination as to patentability/unpatentability of the claims
                        is not made in the decision on the request; rather, this determination will be made during
                        the examination stage of the reexamination proceedings if reexamination is ordered.
                        Accordingly, no <i>prima facie</i> case of unpatentability
                        need be found to grant an order for reexamination. If a decision to deny an order for
                        reexamination is made, the requester may seek review by a petition under CFR 1.181. See 37
                        CFR 1.515(c). It should be noted that a decision to deny the request for reexamination is
                        equivalent to a final holding (subject only to a petition pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e330053">37 CFR
                              1.515(c)</a></b> for review of the denial) that the request failed to raise a
                        substantial new question of patentability based on the cited art (patents and printed

                        to grant reexamination. The Office’s determination in both the order for reexamination and
                        the examination stage of the reexamination will generally be limited solely to a review of
                        the claim(s) for which reexamination was requested. If the requester was interested in
                        having all of the claims reexamined, requester had the opportunity to include them in its
                        request for reexamination. However, if the requester chose not to do so, those claim(s) for
                        which reexamination was not requested will generally not be reexamined by the Office. It is
                        further noted that <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306474">35 U.S.C. 302</a></b> requires that “[t]he

                        claims, then the requester is not statutorily entitled to reexamination of such claims. If
                        a requester chooses not to request reexamination for a claim, and thus fails to set forth
                        the pertinency and manner of applying the cited art to that claim as required by
