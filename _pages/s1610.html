                        The Action [R-08.2012]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e162116">The action on the application by the
                        examiner will include all matters as provided for in other types of patent applications.
                        See <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324375">37
                              CFR 1.161</a></b>.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e162122">With reference to the examination of
                        the claim, the language must be such that it is directed to the “new and distinct variety
                        of plant.” This is important as under no circumstance should the claim be directed to a new
                        variety of flower or fruit in contradistinction to the plant bearing the flower or the tree
                        bearing the fruit. This is in spite of the fact that it is accepted and general botanical
                        parlance to say “A variety of apple or a variety of blackberry” to mean a variety of apple
                        tree or a variety of blackberry plant.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e162125">Where the application is otherwise
                        allowable, a claim which recites, for example “A new variety of apple characterized by,”
                        may be amended by the insertion of - tree - after “apple” by an examiner’s
                        amendment.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e162134">By the same token, the title of the
                        invention must relate to the entire plant and not to its flower or fruit, thus: Apple Tree,
                        Rose Plant.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e162137">Care should also be exercised that the
                        specification does not contain unwarranted advertising, for example, “the disclosed plant
                        being grown in the XYZ Nurseries of Topeka, Kansas.” It follows, also, that in the drawings
                        any showing in the background of a plant, as a sign carrying the name of an individual,
                        nursery, etc., is objectionable and deletion thereof is required. Nor should the
                        specification include laudatory expressions, such as, “The rose is prettier than any other
                        rose.” Such expressions are wholly irrelevant. Where the fruit is described, statements in
                        the specification as to the character and quality of products made from the fruit are not
                        necessary and should be deleted.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e162140">The Office action may include so much
                        of any report of the ARS as the examiner deems necessary, or may embody no part of it. In
                        the event of an interview, the examiner, in his or her discretion, may show the entire
                        report to the inventor or attorney.
                     </p>

                        reference portions of the ARS report.

                        ascertained by the examiner that the same can be supported by affidavits by said
                        specialists (<b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322124">37 CFR 1.104(d)(2)</a></b>). See <i>Ex parte Rosenberg,</i> 46&nbsp;USPQ 393 (Bd. App.
