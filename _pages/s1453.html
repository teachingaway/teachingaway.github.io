                              or equation should be made by bracketing the entire formula and rewriting and totally
                              underlining the amended formula in the re-presented paragraph of the specification or
                              rewritten claim in which the changed formula or equation appears. Amendments of
                              segments of a formula or equation should not be made. If the original patent includes
                              bracketing and underlining from an earlier reissue, double brackets and double
                              underlining should be used in the subject reissue application to identify and
                              distinguish the present changes being made. The subject reissue, when printed, would
                              include double brackets (indicating deletions made in the subject reissue) and
                              boldface type (indicating material added in the subject reissue). If the original
                              patent includes bracketing and underlining from an earlier reexamination, the reissue
                              application must be presented as if the changes made to the original patent text via
                              the reexamination certificate are a part of the original patent. Thus, all italicized
                              text of the reexamination certificate is presented in the amendment (made in the
                              reissue application) without italics. Further, any text found in brackets in the
                              reexamination certificate is omitted in the amendment (made in the reissue
                              application). Any canceled claims resulting from the reexamination will be lined
                              through.

                              to be deleted in the second amendment. The word “bone” is NOT to be shown in brackets
                              in the second amendment. Rather, the word “bone” is simply omitted from the claim,
                              because “bone” never appeared in the patent. An explanation of the deletion should
                              appear in the remarks.

                              in the second amendment and did not appear in the patent; accordingly, “notched” is
                              not shown in any form in the claim. The word <span class="Underline">serrated</span> is being added in the second amendment, and accordingly
                              “serrated” is added to the claim and is underlined.

                              and the second amendments, the entire claim is presented only with the changes from
