                        Correspondence Between the USPTO and the Regulatory
                        Agency [R-11.2013]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e277337">It is the Director’s responsibility to
                        decide whether an applicant has satisfied the requirements of the statute and whether the
                        patent qualifies for patent term extension. The regulatory agency possesses expertise and
                        records regarding some of the statutory requirements and has certain direct
                        responsibilities under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303884">35 U.S.C. 156</a></b> for determining the
                        length of the regulatory review period. Consequently, to facilitate eligibility decisions
                        and permit the regulatory agency and the Office to carry out their responsibilities under
                        <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303884">35
                              U.S.C. 156</a></b>, both the Food and Drug Administration and the Department
                        of Agriculture have entered into an “agreement” of cooperation with the Office. <i>Memorandum of Understanding Between the Patent and Trademark Office and
                           the Food and Drug Administration,</i> 52 Fed. Reg. 17830 (May 12, 1987); <i>Memorandum of Understanding Between the Patent and&nbsp;Trademark Office and
                           the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service,</i> 54 Fed. Reg. 26399 (June&nbsp;23,
                        1989); 1104 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 18 (July 11, 1989). The agreements establish the
                        procedures whereby the regulatory agency assists the Office in determining a&nbsp;patent’s
                        eligibility for patent term extension under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303884">35 U.S.C. 156</a></b>. It also
                        establishes procedures for exchanging information between the regulatory agency and
                        the&nbsp;Office regarding regulatory review period determinations, due diligence petitions and
                        informal regulatory agency hearings under the law. The patent term extension applicant
                        receives a copy of all correspondence between the Office and the regulatory agency.

                        Service of the Department of Agriculture is responsible for assisting the Office in
                        determining the eligibility of patent claiming a veterinary biological product that has
                        been subject to the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151-59) and for determining the
                        regulatory review period of the veterinary biological product. The Secretary of Health and
                        Human Services of the Food and Drug Administration is responsible for assisting the Office
                        in determining the eligibility of patents claiming any other product for which regulatory
                        review gives rise to eligibility for patent term extension. 21 CFR 60.10.

                           anticipated that the informalities will be corrected or explained, a first letter is
                           sent to the regulatory agency to request information regarding eligibility. The letter
                           is accompanied by a copy of the patent term extension application. This letter does

                           information which is not readily available to the Office. The assistance on the part of
                           the regulatory agency enables both the Office and the agency to process applications

                        </h2>
                        <p id="d0e277403">Upon receipt of a reply from the
                           regulatory agency to the first letter from the Office requesting assistance on
                           determining eligibility, a preliminary eligibility decision (not the final decision) is
                           made as to whether the patent is eligible for an extension of its term. As noted above,
                           the reply from the regulatory agency will usually inform the Office as to whether the
                           permission for commercial marketing and use of the product on which the application for
                           patent term extension is based is the <span class="Underline">first</span> such
                           approval for that product. Furthermore, the regulatory agency usually provides
                           information regarding the date of product approval to permit a determination as to
                           whether the application was filed within the sixty-day statutory period. The information
                           provided by the regulatory agency is then&nbsp;compared with the related information from the
                           application. If no major discrepancies are found and the patent is determined to be
                           eligible for patent term extension, a second letter requesting a determination of the
                           length of the regulatory review period of the product is mailed to the regulatory agency
                           not later than sixty (60) days after the Office receipt date of the reply from the
                           regulatory agency. In the interest of efficiency, if the patent is determined to be
                           ineligible for patent term extension, the Office will dismiss the application rather
                           than request a determination of the regulatory review period. <i>In re Allen &amp; Hansbury, Ltd.,</i> 227 USPQ 955, 960 n. 9 (Comm’r Pat.
                           &amp; Tm. 1985). The second letter states that, subject to final review, the patent is
                           considered eligible for patent term extension and requests a determination of the
                           applicable regulatory review period.
