                        <p id="d0e163790"> The Patent Cooperation Treaty
                           				(PCT) enables the U.S. applicant to file one application, “an international
                           				application,” in a standardized format in English in the U.S. Receiving Office (the
                           				U.S. Patent and Trademark Office), and have that application acknowledged as a
                           				regular national or regional filing in as many Contracting States to the PCT as the
                           				applicant “designates” or “elects,” that is, names, as countries or regions in which
                           				patent protection is desired. (For international applications filed on or after
                           				January 1, 2004, the filing of an international application will automatically
                           				constitute the designation of all contracting countries to the PCT on that filing
                           				date.) In the same manner, the PCT enables foreign applicants to file a PCT
                           				international application, designating the United States of America, in their home
                           				language in their home patent office and have the application acknowledged as a
                           				regular U.S. national filing. The PCT also provides for an international search
                           				report and written opinion (for international applications filed on or after January
                           				1, 2004) that are established normally at 16 months from the priority date, and
                           				publication of the international application after 18 months from the priority date.
                           				Upon payment of national fees and the furnishing of any required translation,
                           				usually 30 months after the filing of any priority application for the invention, or
                           				the international filing date if no priority is claimed, the application will be
                           				subjected to national procedures for granting of patents in each of the designated
                           				countries. For any countries remaining whose national laws are not compatible with
                           				the 30 month period set forth in <b><a href="mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e363665">PCT Article
                                 					22(1)</a></b>, the filing of a demand for an international
                           				preliminary examination electing such countries within 19 months from the priority
                           				date will result in an extension of the period for entering the national stage to 30
                           				months from the priority date. An up-to-date list of such countries may be found on
                           				WIPO’s web site (www.wipo.int/pct/en/index.html). A brief description of the basic
                           				flow under the PCT is provided in <b><a href="s1842.html#d0e171994">MPEP § 1842</a></b> .

                           				route to filing patent applications directly in the patent offices of those
                           				countries which are Contracting States of the PCT. It does not preclude taking
                           				advantage of the priority rights and other advantages provided under the Paris
                           				Convention and the WTO administered Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of
                           				Intellectual Property (TRIPS Agreement). The PCT provides an additional and optional
                           				foreign filing route to patent applicants.

                           				publication procedures are provided for in Chapter I of the PCT. Additional
                           				procedures for a preliminary examination of PCT international applications are
                           				provided for in optional PCT Chapter II.

                           				application is filed first. An international application for the same subject matter
                           				will then be filed subsequently within the priority year provided by the Paris
                           				Convention and the priority benefit of the U.S. national application filing date
                           				will be claimed.

                           				receiving Office will grant an international filing date to the application, collect
