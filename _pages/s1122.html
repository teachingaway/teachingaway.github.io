                           subject to eighteen-month publication or the applicant’s past practices or tendencies
                           with respect to the filing of foreign counterpart applications. The fact that a
                           particular applicant has a tendency to file counterpart applications for fewer than
                           fifty percent of its U.S. applications is not alone an adequate basis for filing all or
                           any of the U.S. applications with a nonpublication request. The applicant must have an
                           affirmative intent not to file a counterpart application, and not just the absence of
                           any intent or plan concerning the filing of any counterpart application that would be
                           subject to eighteen-month publication. A nonpublication request is only appropriate if
                           the applicant’s intent at the time the nonpublication request is being filed is not to
                           file a counterpart foreign or international application that would be subject to
                           eighteen-month publication.
