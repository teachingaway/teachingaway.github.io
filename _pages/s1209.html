                              such a hearing necessary or desirable for a proper presentation of the appeal.
                              An appeal decided on the briefs without an oral hearing will receive the same
                              consideration by the Board as appeals decided after an oral

                              the fee set forth in § 41.20(b)(3) within two months from the date of the
                              examiner's answer or on the date of filing of a reply brief, whichever is

                              the oral hearing will be set, and due notice thereof given to appellant. If an

                              the primary examiner if considered desirable by either the primary examiner or

                              for the primary examiner unless otherwise ordered.

                                    (e)(2) of this section.

                                    or a Federal Court.

                              decides that a hearing is not necessary, the Board will so notify

                        used to request an oral hearing. This time period may only be extended by filing a request

                        hearing is not filed in a separate paper captioned “REQUEST FOR ORAL HEARING,” the request
                        is improper and the appeal will be assigned for consideration and decision on the briefs
                        without an oral hearing. Likewise, if the request is not timely filed or accompanied by the
                        appropriate fee, the request is improper and the appeal will be assigned for consideration
                        and decision on the briefs without an oral hearing.

                     <p id="d0e127673">A notice of hearing, stating the date,
                        the time, and the docket, is forwarded to the appellant in due course. If appellant fails
                        to confirm the hearing within the time required in the notice of hearing or the appellant
                        waives the hearing, the appeal will be removed from the hearing docket and assigned on
                        brief in due course. No refund of the fee for requesting an oral hearing will be made.
                        Similarly, after confirmation, if no appearance is made at the scheduled hearing, the
                        appeal will be decided on brief. Since failure to notify the Board of waiver of hearing in
                        advance of the assigned date results in a waste of the Board’s resources, appellant should
                        inform the Board of a change in plans at the earliest possible opportunity. If the Director
                        or the Board determines that a hearing is not necessary (e.g., a Director-ordered remand to
                        the examiner is necessary or it is clear that the rejection(s) cannot be sustained),
                        appellant will be notified.

                        advance, as long as such request does not unduly delay a decision in the case and does not
                        place an undue administrative burden on the Board.

                     <p id="d0e127687">The appellant may also file a request,

                        telephone or an audio-video connection. The appellant making the request will be required
                        to bear the cost of the telephone call or the audio-video connection. Prior to the hearing
                        date, the Board’s IT specialist may contact the appellant making an audio-video request to
                        confirm software compatibility.

                        his/her arguments (e.g., for a PowerPoint® presentation). The Office may provide a
                        projector for the appellant’s use subject to availability. The appellant making the request
                        is responsible for providing his or her own laptop or mobile computer.

                        notice of hearing conflicts with prior commitments or if subsequent events make appearance
                        impossible, the hearing may be rescheduled on written request, in a separate paper
                        addressed to the Clerk of the Board. However, in view of the administrative burden involved
                        in rescheduling hearings and the potential delay which may result in the issuance of any
                        patent based on the application on appeal, postponements are discouraged and will not be
                        granted in the absence of convincing reasons in support of the requested
                        change.

                        appellant to explain his or her position. If appellant believes that additional time will
                        be necessary, the appellant should file a request in a separate paper addressed to the
                        Clerk of the Board well in advance of the hearing. The request for such time will be taken
                        into consideration in assigning the hearing date. The final decision on whether additional
                        time is to be granted rests within the discretion of the senior member of the panel hearing
                        the case.

                        based upon a recent relevant decision of either the Board or a Federal

                           <h3>Examiner Note:</h3>
                           <p id="d1fcad_258d1_370">1. For use if the notice of appeal was filed on or
                              after January 23, 2012.
                           </p>
                           <p id="fp-pt-d538e14">2. Use this form paragraph only if
                              an oral hearing has been requested by appellant <span class="Underline">and</span> the primary
                              examiner intends to present an oral argument.
                           </p>
                           <p id="fp-pt-d538e20">3. This form paragraph must be
                              included as a separate letter on a form PTOL-90.
                           </p>
                        </div>
                        <p id="d0e127763">In those appeals in which an oral
                           hearing has been confirmed by the appellant and the primary examiner has indicated a
                           desire to participate in the oral argument, oral argument will generally only be held if
                           the appellant actually appears for oral argument. If the appellant fails to make an
                           appearance for oral argument, the hearing typically will be waived, and the primary
                           examiner will not be given an opportunity to participate unless the panel hearing the
                           case deems that a presentation by the primary examiner would be useful. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e127766">After the oral hearing has been
                           confirmed and the date set as provided in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356921">37 CFR 41.47(d)</a></b>,
                           the primary examiner and the examiner’s supervisor should be notified of the date and
                           time of the hearing. In those cases where the Board requests the presentation of an oral
                           argument by or on behalf of the primary examiner, the Board’s request may, where
                           appropriate, indicate specific points or questions to which the argument should be
                           particularly directed. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e127782">On the day of the hearing, examiners
                           associated with the appeal should notify the usher at the Board that they are associated
                           with the appeal and that they are attending the hearing. In addition, the primary
                           examiner associated with the appeal should indicate whether they plan to participate in
                           the oral hearing. At the hearing, after the appellant has made his or her presentation,
                           the examiner will be allowed 15 minutes to reply as well as to present a statement which
                           clearly sets forth his or her position with respect to the issues and rejections of
                           record. Generally, the primary examiner may rely on only argument and evidence relied
                           upon in the examiner’s answer. The primary examiner may, however, rely on a new argument
                           based upon a recent relevant decision of either the Board or a Federal Court. Appellant
                           may utilize any allotted time not used in the initial presentation for rebuttal.
