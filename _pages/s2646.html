                           (i.e., the <i>inter partes</i> reexamination statute). In

                              partes</i> reexamination proceedings. Because the substantive determination is
                           not subject to review by petition or otherwise, neither the patent owner nor the third
                           party requester has a right to petition, or request reconsideration of, a finding that
                           the prior art patents or printed publications raise a SNQ/RLP. There is no right to
                           petition such a finding even if the finding of a SNQ/RLP is based on reasons other than
                           those urged by the third party requester (or based on less than all the grounds urged by
                           the third party requester). Where the examiner determines that a date of a reference is
                           early enough such that the reference constitutes prior art, that determination is not
                           petitionable (with respect to vacating the examiner’s finding of a SNQ/RLP). Where the
