                                 reexamination proceeding for the patent (for which reissue is requested) is

                              Director may determine the manner in which the PTAB Review Proceeding and other

                              examined as a reissue application, the examiner is to consult with the TQAS who will
                              coordinate with the PTAB before taking any action on the reissue application.
