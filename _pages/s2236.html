                        Assignment of Reexamination [R-11.2013]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e224771">Reexamination requests should normally
                        be assigned to the Central Reexamination Unit (CRU) art unit which examines the technology
                        (Chemical, Electrical, Mechanical, etc.) in which the patent to be reexamined is currently
                        classified as an original. In that art unit, the CRU Supervisory Patent Reexamination
                        Specialist (SPRS) will assign the reexamination request to a primary examiner, other than
                        the examiner who originally examined the patent application (see “Examiner Assignment
                        Policy” below), who is most familiar with the claimed subject matter of the patent. In an
                        extremely rare situation, where a proceeding is still in a Technology Center (TC) rather
                        than the CRU, the reexamination may be assigned to an assistant examiner if no
                        knowledgeable primary examiner is available. In such an instance a primary examiner must
                        sign all actions and take responsibility for all actions taken.

                        <p id="d0e224792">It is the policy of the Office that
                           the CRU SPRS will assign the reexamination request to an examiner different from the
                           examiner(s) who examined the patent application. Thus, under normal circumstances, the
                           reexamination request will not be assigned to a primary examiner or assistant examiner
                           who was involved in any part of the examination of the patent for which reexamination is
                           requested (e.g., by preparing/signing an action), or was so involved in the examination
                           of the parent of the patent. This would preclude assignment of the request to an
                           examiner who was a conferee in an appeal conference or panel review conference in an
                           earlier concluded examination of the patent (e.g., the application for patent, a
                           reissue, or a prior concluded reexamination proceeding). The conferee is considered to
                           have participated in preparing the Office action which is preceded by the
                           conference.

                        <p id="d0e224802"><b id="d0e224803">Exceptions to this general policy include</b> cases where the
                           original examiner is the only examiner with adequate knowledge of the relevant
                           technology to examine the case. In the unusual case where there is a need to assign the
                           request to the original examiner, the assignment must be approved by the CRU Director,
                           and the fact that such approval was given by the CRU Director must be stated by the
                           examiner in the decision on the request for reexamination.

                        <p id="d0e224807">It should be noted that while an
                           examiner who examined an earlier concluded reexamination proceeding is generally
                           excluded from assignment of a newly filed reexamination, if the earlier reexamination is
                           still ongoing, the same examiner will be assigned the new reexamination.

                                    examiner who did not examine the original patent application even though the
                                    examiner who examined the patent application is handling the reissue

                                          delivered to OPLA at the time of the notification to OPLA. If the

                                          was involved in any part of the examination of patent for which
                                          reexamination is requested (e.g., by preparing/signing an action), or

                                          provide guidance as to assignment of the reissue proceeding depending

                                          reissue and reexamination proceedings are merged by OPLA, the reissue
                                          application will generally be assigned in the TC having the reissue
