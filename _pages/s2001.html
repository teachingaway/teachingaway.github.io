                           <li id="d0e195462" class="nobull">(a) A patent by its very nature
                              is affected with a public interest. The public interest is best served, and the
                              most effective patent examination occurs when, at the time an application is
                              being examined, the Office is aware of and evaluates the teachings of all
                              information material to patentability. Each individual associated with the
                              filing and prosecution of a patent application has a duty of candor and good
                              faith in dealing with the Office, which includes a duty to disclose to the
                              Office all information known to that individual to be material to patentability
                              as defined in this section. The duty to disclose information exists with
                              respect to each pending claim until the claim is cancelled or withdrawn from
                              consideration, or the application becomes abandoned. Information material to
                              the patentability of a claim that is cancelled or withdrawn from consideration
                              need not be submitted if the information is not material to the patentability
                              of any claim remaining under consideration in the application. There is no duty
                              to submit information which is not material to the patentability of any
                              existing claim. The duty to disclose all information known to be material to
                              patentability is deemed to be satisfied if all information known to be material
                              to patentability of any claim issued in a patent was cited by the Office or
                              submitted to the Office in the manner prescribed by <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e321609">§§
                                    1.97</a></b>(b)-(d) and <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e321738">1.98</a></b>.
                              However, no patent will be granted on an application in connection with which
                              fraud on the Office was practiced or attempted or the duty of disclosure was
                              violated through bad faith or intentional misconduct. The Office encourages
                              applicants to carefully examine:

                                 nature is affected with a public interest. The public interest is best
                                 served, and the most effective patent examination occurs when, at the time
                                 an application is being examined, the Office is aware of and evaluates the
                                 teachings of all information material to patentability. Each individual
                                 associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application has a
                                 duty of candor and good faith in dealing with the Office, which includes a
                                 duty to disclose to the Office all information known to that individual to
                                 be material to patentability as defined in this section. The duty to
                                 disclose information exists with respect to each pending claim until the
                                 claim is cancelled or withdrawn from consideration, or the application
                                 becomes abandoned. Information material to the patentability of a claim that
                                 is cancelled or withdrawn from consideration need not be submitted if the
                                 information is not material to the patentability of any claim remaining
                                 under consideration in the application. There is no duty to submit
                                 information which is not material to the patentability of any existing
                                 claim. The duty to disclose all information known to be material to
                                 patentability is deemed to be satisfied if all information known to be
                                 material to patentability of any claim issued in a patent was cited by the
                                 Office or submitted to the Office in the manner prescribed by

                           best served when an inventor is issued a patent with the scope of protection that is

                           An incentive remains to submit the information to the Office because it will result in a
                           strengthened patent and will avoid later questions of materiality and intent to deceive.
                           In addition, the new rules will actually facilitate the filing of information since the
                           burden of submitting information to the Office has been reduced by eliminating, in most

                              Supp. 933, 216 USPQ 976 (S.D. N.Y. 1982) wherein a patent was held invalid or
                              unenforceable because patentee’s foreign counsel did not disclose to patentee’s
                              United States counsel or to the Office prior art cited by the Dutch Patent Office in
                              connection with the patentee’s corresponding Dutch application. The court stated, 542

                              papers raising such defenses. At a minimum, the applicant should call the attention
                              of the Office to the litigation, the existence and the nature of any allegations
                              relating to validity and/or “fraud,” or “inequitable conduct” relating to the
                              original patent, and the nature of litigation materials relating to these issues.
