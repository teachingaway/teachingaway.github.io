                           <li id="d0e25066" class="nobull">(a) No correspondence relating
                              to an application should be filed prior to receipt of the application number
                              from the Patent and Trademark Office. When a letter directed to the Patent and
                              Trademark Office concerns a previously filed application for a patent, it must
                              identify on the top page in a conspicuous location, the application number
                              (consisting of the series code and the serial number; e.g. , 07/123,456), or
                              the serial number and filing date assigned to that application by the Patent
                              and Trademark Office, or the international application number of the
                              international application. Any correspondence not containing such
                              identification will be returned to the sender where a return address is
                              available. The returned correspondence will be accompanied with a cover letter
                              which will indicate to the sender that if the returned correspondence is
                              resubmitted to the Patent and Trademark Office within two weeks of the mail
                              date on the cover letter, the original date of receipt of the correspondence
                              will be considered by the Patent and Trademark Office as the date of receipt of
                              the correspondence. Applicants may use either the Certificate of Mailing or
                              Transmission procedure under § <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313726">1.8</a></b> or the

                              resubmissions of returned correspondence if they desire to have the benefit of
                              the date of deposit in the United States Postal Service. If the returned
                              correspondence is not resubmitted within the two-week period, the date of
                              receipt of the resubmission will be considered to be the date of receipt of the
                              correspondence. The two-week period to resubmit the returned correspondence
                              will not be extended. In addition to the application number, all letters
                              directed to the Patent and Trademark Office concerning applications for patent
                              should also state the name of the first listed inventor, the title of the

                              assigned.

                              is required pursuant to 37 CFR 1.4(e). The word original, as used herein, is defined
                              as correspondence which is personally signed in permanent dark ink or its equivalent
                              by the person whose signature appears thereon. Dark ink or equivalent permits
                              traditional ink and newer non-liquid gel type ink technologies. Since incoming
                              correspondence is electronically stored and scanned as a black and white image, a
                              dark color is required so that the scanned image is legible. Where copies of
                              correspondence are acceptable, photocopies or facsimile transmissions may be filed.
                              For example, a photocopy or facsimile transmission of an original of an amendment,
                              declaration (e.g., under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319759">37 CFR 1.63</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319992">1.67</a></b>), petition, issue fee transmittal form, and authorization

                              application. Where copies are permitted, second and further generation copies (i.e.,
                              copy of a copy) are acceptable. For example, a client may fax a paper to an attorney
                              and the attorney may then fax the paper to the Office, provided the paper is eligible
                              to be faxed (see <b><a href="s502.html#d0e25755">MPEP § 502.01</a></b>). The original, if not
                              submitted to the Office, should be retained as evidence of proper execution in the
                              event that questions arise as to the authenticity of the signature reproduced on the

                              arises, the Office may require submission of the original.

                              punctuation marks would be improper (e.g., /- - -/). In addition, punctuation marks,
                              such as question marks (e.g., /???/), are often utilized to represent an intent not

                              While the certification is directed at the person inserting another S- signature, the

                              signature so as to identify the signer and clarify the record where the identity of
                              the signer is unclear. An example of when ratification or confirmation of a signature
                              may be required is when there are variations in a signature or whenever a name in an
                              S-signature is not exactly the same as the name indicated as an inventor, or a
                              practitioner of record. Hence, whatever signature is adopted by a signer, that
                              signature should be consistently used on all documents. Also addressed is the
                              treatment of variations in a signature or where a printed or typed name accompanies
                              the S-signature but the identity of the signer is unclear. In such cases, the Office
                              may require ratification or confirmation of a signature. Ratification requires the
                              person ratifying to state he/she personally signed the previously submitted document
                              as well as, if needed, the submission of a compliant format of the signature.
                              Confirmation includes submitting a duplicate document, which is compliantly signed if
                              the previous signature was noncompliant (as opposed to unclear).

                              Office may require a resubmission of a properly signed duplicate document.
                              Resubmission of a document may be required, for example, where ratification alone is
                              inappropriate, such as where the image of the signature is of such poor quality
                              (e.g., illegible font) that the Office is unable to store or reproduce the document
                              with the signature image.

                              does not provide a means for changing the name of a signer. For example, when an
                              inventor changes her/his name and the inventor desires to change her/his name in the
                              nonprovisional application, such change must be by way of a request under 37 CFR

                              authenticity (veracity) of the signature. Evidence of authenticity may include
                              evidence establishing a chain of custody of a document from the person signing the
                              document to the person filing the document. Proper evidence of a chain of custody
                              will aid in avoiding the impact of repudiation of a signature.

                           <p id="d0e26802">Where there has been a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to follow the rule, but where there is
                              some doubt as to the identity of the signer of a signed document, the Office may
                              require ratification of the signature. Note, ratification would only be an effective
                              remedy if the signer was a proper party to have executed the document to be ratified.
                              For example, a practitioner of record may ratify his or her signature on an
                              amendment, but not the signature of a secretary who is not a practitioner or inventor
                              in the application. A registered practitioner may, however, ratify the amendment made
                              by another registered practitioner but may not ratify a document required to be
                              signed by an inventor, such as a <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319759">37&nbsp;CFR 1.63</a></b> declaration.
                              Similarly, an inadvertent typographical error or simple misspelling of a name will be
                              treated as a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to follow the rule,
                              which would require ratification only where there is some doubt as to the identity of
                              the signer rather than be treated as an unsigned paper requiring resubmission. Where
                              there is an obvious typographical error so that the Office does not have some doubt
                              as to the identity of the signer (and therefore notification to applicant is not
                              needed), further action by applicant would not be required and, where appropriate,
                              the obvious error will be noted in the record.

                              the S-signature is composed of non-text graphic characters (e.g., a smiley face) and

                              correspondence.&nbsp; EFS-Web is accessible via the Internet on the USPTO Web site.&nbsp; The

                              patent documents in Portable Document Format (PDF) directly to the USPTO.&nbsp; Users may
                              electronically submit most patent applications, reexamination requests, and other
                              patent-related documents securely using EFS-Web.&nbsp; Users may also use EFS-Web to
                              submit payments of most patent fees including patent application filing fees.&nbsp; Users
                              need not provide a duplicate copy of any document filed through EFS-Web unless the
                              USPTO specifically requires the filing of a duplicate in a particular situation.&nbsp;
                              Users may review and check their electronic submissions including their attached PDF
                              files before submitting the documents to the USPTO.&nbsp; After submitting the documents
                              via EFS-Web, the system will display a page that states that the USPTO has received
                              the user’s submission.&nbsp; The users, generally within two hours, will receive an

                                 format is so feature-rich, certain PDF features are currently not supported by the
                                 USPTO systems.&nbsp; For example, PDF documents with multiple layers must be flattened
                                 prior to submission to ensure that the complete document is received by the USPTO
                                 and readable to the examiner or other deciding officials.&nbsp; If a document contains
                                 layers that are marked as “invisible”, the invisible layers will be lost when the
                                 document is processed by the USPTO, and thus the official records in IFW will not
                                 contain the information on the invisible layers.&nbsp; Furthermore, if a user uses the
                                 PDF comments or annotations to enter the information on a form, only the blank
                                 form without the PDF comments and annotations will be processed.&nbsp; Therefore, the
                                 complete document will not be officially filed at the USPTO and the user cannot
                                 rely on the Electronic Acknowledgement Receipt as evidence that the completed form
                                 was filed at the USPTO.&nbsp; Users are encouraged to check the contents of their

                                    application or a follow-on document in a patent application using EFS-Web, the
                                    user must select from the list of document descriptions to specify the files
                                    being submitted via EFS-Web.&nbsp; For instance, when the user is filing a patent
                                    application, the submission must be separated into appropriate sections:&nbsp;
                                    specification, claims, abstract, and drawing; and when the user is filing an
                                    amendment, the user must select the appropriate type of amendment:&nbsp; amendment
                                    after non-final, amendment after allowance, preliminary amendment, and
                                    amendment after final.&nbsp; Based on the document description selected by the user,
                                    a document code is assigned and a message regarding the document submitted to
                                    the USPTO will be forwarded to the appropriate organization for processing, and
                                    to the appropriate official for consideration.&nbsp; Furthermore, the IFW and PAIR
                                    systems use the document code for identifying the document maintained in the
                                    application file.&nbsp; Therefore, accurate document indexing is important to
                                    facilitate efficient processing and proper consideration of the document by the
                                    USPTO.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp;(a) if the user indicated an after-final amendment as a
                                    non-final amendment, the processing of such amendment may be delayed and the
                                    examiner may not have sufficient time to consider the amendment before the time
                                    period expires; (b) if the user selects the “Pre-Grant Publication” radio
                                    button on the EFS-Web data collection screen for submitting a substitute
                                    specification filed in response to a non-final Office action, the submission
                                    will be forwarded to the publication branch rather than processed into IFW and
                                    forwarded to the examiner for consideration; and (c) if the user selects
                                    “drawings - only black and white line drawings: for submitting color drawings
                                    in a utility application rather than “drawing - other than black and white line
                                    drawings:, the color drawing would not be processed as color drawings, and
                                    would be maintained as black and white drawings in IFW.

                              certificates to meet federal government computer system authentication guidelines as
                              defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Office
                              of Management and Budget (OMB).&nbsp; The required evaluation of EFS-Web and PAIR
                              determined that level three authentication was needed; this is met by the USPTO’s
                              PKI. 
                           </p>
                           <p id="d0e27999">Only a PKI certificate holder (or
                              the designated employee under the certificate holder’s direction and control) can
                              submit follow-on documents.&nbsp; This preserves confidentiality, and is consistent with
                              power of attorney and correspondence regulations.&nbsp; In order to obtain a PKI
                              certificate, the user must be a registered practitioner (i.e., an attorney or agent)
                              or an inventor, and complete the appropriate paperwork (e.g., review the PKI
                              subscriber agreement and complete the certificate action form, available on the USPTO
                              Web site).&nbsp; Once the user has a PKI certificate, the user can authenticate himself or
                              herself to the USPTO through the EFS-Web sign-on.&nbsp; This will generate a secure,
                              encrypted connection with the USPTO.

                              non-authenticated workflow.&nbsp; The user would go to the EFS-Web page and choose to
                              submit without a PKI certificate as a non-registered user, which would generate a
                              Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection for the session, thus allowing secure data
                              transmission to the USPTO.&nbsp; Non-registered users have the same level of protection
                              for filing as a registered user, but are limited to submission of initial filings.&nbsp;
                              This practice minimizes the risk of improperly-filed third party submissions and
                              other documents.&nbsp; Non-registered users may file follow-on documents by mail (with a
