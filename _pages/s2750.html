                        Patent Term Extension for Delays at other Agencies under 35 U.S.C.
                        156 [R-11.2013]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e275641">The right to a patent term extension
                        based upon regulatory review is the result of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term
                        Restoration Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-417, 98 Stat. 1585 (codified at 21&nbsp;U.S.C. 355(b),
                        (j), (l); <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303884">35 U.S.C. 156</a></b>, <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305527">271</a></b>,
                        <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305845">282</a></b>)(Hatch-Waxman Act). The act sought to eliminate two distortions
                        to the normal “patent term produced by the requirement that certain products must receive
                        premarket regulatory approval.”<i> Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Medtronic
                           Inc.,</i> 496 U.S. 661, 669, 15 USPQ2d 1121, 1126 (1990). The first distortion was
                        that the patent owner loses patent term during the early years of the patent because the
                        product cannot be commercially marketed without approval from a regulatory agency. The
                        second distortion occurred after the end of the patent term because competitors could not
                        immediately enter the market upon expiration of the patent because they were not allowed to
                        begin testing and other activities necessary to receive FDA approval before patent
                        expiration.

                              U.S.C. 156</a></b> was designed to create new incentives for research and
                        development of certain products subject to premarket government approval by a regulatory
                        agency. The statute enables the owners of patents on certain human drugs, food or color
                        additives, medical devices, animal drugs, and veterinary biological products to restore to
                        the terms of those patents some of the time lost while awaiting premarket government
                        approval from a regulatory agency. The rights derived from extension of the patent term

                        are not limited to a claim-by-claim basis. Rather, <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303889">subsection(a) of 156</a></b>
                        indicates that “[t]he term of a patent which claims a product, a method of using a product,
                        or a method of manufacturing a product shall be extended.” See <i>Genetics Institute
                           LLC v. Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Inc.,</i> 655 F.3d 1291, 99 USPQ2d 1713
                        (Fed. Cir. 2011). However, pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303936">35 U.S.C. 156(b)</a></b> , if the patent claims
                        other products in addition to the approved product, the exclusive patent rights to the
                        additional products expire with the original expiration date of the patent.

                        law under which the applicable regulatory review period occurred for commercial marketing

                        regarding the sixty-day period has been clarified by the America Invents Act where the Act
                        provides that, “[f]or purposes of determining the date on which a product receives
                        permission under the second sentence of this paragraph, if such permission is transmitted
                        after 4:30 P.M., Eastern Time, on a business day, or is transmitted on a day that is not a
                        business day, the product shall be deemed to receive such permission on the next business
                        day. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term 'business day' means any Monday,
                        Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, excluding any legal holiday under section 6103 of
                        title 5.” See Section 37 of the AIA and <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303884">35 U.S.C. 156</a></b>. The USPTO initially
                        determines whether the application is formally complete and whether the patent is eligible
                        for extension. The statute requires the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark
                        Office to notify the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of Health and Human Services
                        of the submission of an application for extension of patent term which complies with
                        <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303884">35 U.S.C.

                        application. Not later than thirty days after receipt of the application from the Director,
                        the Secretary will determine the length of the applicable regulatory review period and
                        notify the Director of the determination. If the Director determines that the patent is
                        eligible for extension, the Director calculates the length of extension for which the
                        patent is eligible under the appropriate statutory provision and issues an appropriate
                        Certificate of Extension.
