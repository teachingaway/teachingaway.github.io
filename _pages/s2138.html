                        subject matter was actually reduced to practice, in that conception alone is not

                        USPQ at 607. While the filing of an application for patent is a constructive reduction to
                        practice, the filing of an application does not in itself provide the evidence necessary to
                        show an actual reduction to practice of any of the subject matter disclosed in the

                           a patent application within 1 year of a public disclosure is not an unreasonable delay,

                           invention is filed. The filing of a patent application serves as conception and

                           Thus the inventor need not provide evidence of either conception or actual reduction to

                              test must be met: (1) the inventor must have conceived of the invention, (2) the
                              inventor must have had an expectation that the embodiment tested would work for the
                              intended purpose of the invention, and (3) the inventor must have submitted the
