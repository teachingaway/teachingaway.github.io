                        considered. Whenever reexamination correspondence is received, a decision is required of
                        the Office as to the action&nbsp;to&nbsp;be taken on the correspondence based on&nbsp;what type&nbsp;of paper
                        it is and whether it is timely. In&nbsp;certain&nbsp;instances, the submitted correspondence
                        (submission) will be entered into the reexamination file and be considered. In other
                        instances, the correspondence will be entered into the reexamination file, but will not be
                        considered. In still other instances, the&nbsp;correspondence will not be entered into the
                        reexamination file and will be returned to the party that sent it. The return of certain
                        inappropriate submissions, not being considered, reduces the amount of paper which would
                        ultimately have to be scanned into the record. Where an inappropriate (unauthorized,
                        improper) paper has already been scanned into the Image File Wrapper (IFW) of the
                        reexamination proceeding before discovery of the inappropriate nature of the paper, the
                        paper cannot be physically returned to the party that submitted it. Instead, the paper will
                        be “returned” by expunging it, i.e., by marking the paper as “non-public” and “closed” so
                        that the paper does not appear in the active IFW record with the other active papers that
                        comprise the public record of the reexamination proceeding.

                        Director (or in some instances, by the Office of Patent Legal Administration (OPLA)) and is

                                 declarations that are excluded from the page limit requirements include
                                 declarations attempting to swear behind (antedate) the filing date of a reference,
                                 or to establish the date of a printed publication; declarations that provide
                                 comparative tests and results and a scientific or technological analysis of the
                                 results; and other declarations which are limited to establishing facts. However,
                                 if the patent owner’s affidavit or declaration includes any legal argument as to
                                 how an outstanding/proposed rejection is overcome, then the page(s) of the
                                 affidavit or declaration in which the argument appears would be included against
                                 the page limit count. Likewise, if a third party requester affidavit or
                                 declaration includes any legal argument as to how a rejection is supported, then
                                 the page(s) of the affidavit or declaration in which the argument appears would be
                                 included against the page limit count. Similarly, attached exhibits presenting
                                 data or drawings are not included against the page limit count, unless an exhibit
                                 or drawing includes argument as to how the outstanding rejection is overcome. Any
                                 page(s) of the exhibit or sheet(s) of drawings that include such argument would be
                                 included against the page limit count.
