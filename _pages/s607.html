                              must be filed within two years from the date of the deposit account statement
                              indicating such charge, and must include a copy of that deposit account statement.
                              This provision of <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316905">37 CFR 1.26(b)</a></b> applies, for
                              example, in the following types of situations: (1) a deposit account charged for an
                              extension of time pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323655">37 CFR 1.136(a)(3)</a></b> as a result of
                              there being a prior general authorization in the application; or (2) a deposit
                              account charged for the outstanding balance of a fee as a result of an insufficient
                              fee submitted with an authorization to charge the deposit account for any additional
                              fees that are due. In these situations, the party providing the charge authorization
                              is not in a position to know the exact amount by which the deposit account will be
                              charged until the date of the deposit account statement indicating the amount of the
                              charge. Therefore, the two-year time period set forth in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316905">37 CFR
                                    1.26(b)</a></b> does not begin until the date of the deposit account
