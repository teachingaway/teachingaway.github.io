                     <p id="d0e84380">Discussions between an applicant and an
                        examiner are often indispensable to advance the prosecution of a patent application.
                        Generally, interviews that improve the mutual understanding of specific issues in an
                        application should be promoted. Properly conducted, an interview can bridge the gap between
                        an examiner and an applicant with regard to the substantive matters at issue in an
                        application. Interviews often help to advance prosecution and identify patentable subject
                        matter. The applicant and the examiner should consider the advantages of conducting an
                        interview to advance the prosecution of a particular patent application. Positions
                        presented during an interview should be advanced with decorum and courtesy. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch700_d1ffd0_25ad2_332">An interview should be granted when the nature of
                        the case is such that the interview serves to develop or clarify outstanding issues in an
                        application. Both applicants and examiners should understand that interview time is limited
                        for both, and therefore they should use the interview time efficiently. Both parties should
                        ensure the interview does not extend beyond a reasonable time and minimize interruptions
                        during the interview. Applicants and examiners should facilitate the grouping of interviews
                        where effective.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch700_d1ffd0_25ae7_2ba">All discussions between the
                        applicant/practitioner and the examiner regarding the merits of a pending application will
                        be considered an interview and are to be made of record. This includes any and all records
                        or communications received in connection with the interview, whether the interview was
                        conducted in-person or through a telephone conversation, video conference, electronic mail,
                        or electronic message system. This policy and other interview tips are detailed in the
                        Interview Best Practices document which is available at <b><a href="http://www.uspto.gov/patents/law/exam/interview_best_practices.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.uspto.gov/patents/law/exam/interview_ best_ practices.pdf</a></b>.
                        Where an electronic record is created as part of the interview, e.g., a series of
                        electronic messages, a copy of the electronic record is to be made of record in the
                        application. Where an electronic record is not created a summary of the interview must be
                        made of record.

                                    ability to hold face-to-face interviews. A request for a face-to-face
                                    interview will normally be granted. Other times, a telephone interview
                                    provides an appropriate level of interaction.

                                    in-person interview. The examiner shall accommodate an applicant, attorney,
                                    or agent’s preference for an interview via telephone conversation, video
                                    conference, electronic mail, or electronic instant message system using
                                    USPTO-based collaboration tools, consistent with the special requirements of

                                    remotely participating via the phone or video conference. In this instance,

                                    and/or internet access to facilitate the interview. Appropriate USPTO
                                    representative may be present with the applicant during the on campus
                                    interview.

                                    remotely should arrange to hold an interview on campus if the timing can be

                                    will be required to travel to campus for an in-person interview. The
                                    decision on special situations will be made at the TC Director level or
                                    higher as to whether the examiner of record or another USPTO representative
                                    will be on campus for the interview. A hoteling examiner within the local
                                    commuting area of a satellite office may use that satellite office for
                                    in-person or video conference interviews.

                              justify the examiner’s refusal of the interview at that time, particularly in an
                              involved case.

                              interview should be rescheduled. It is desirable that the attorney or applicant
                              indicate in advance what issues he or she desires to discuss at the interview by
                              submitting, in writing, a proposed amendment. This would permit the examiner to
                              prepare in advance for the interview and to focus on the matters set forth in the
                              proposed amendment.

                              would require further search and consideration. Nor should the examiner hesitate to
                              conclude an interview when it appears that no common ground can be reached or when it
                              becomes apparent that the application requires further amendment or an additional
                              action by the examiner. However, the examiner should attempt to identify issues and
                              resolve differences during the interview as much as possible.

                              is not extended beyond a reasonable period.

                           In all other applications, an interview before the first Office action is encouraged
                           where the examiner determines that such an interview would advance prosecution of the
                           application. Thus, the examiner may require that an applicant requesting an interview
                           before the first Office action provide a paper that includes a general statement of the
                           state of the art at the time of the invention, and an identification of no more than
                           three (3) references believed to be the “closest” prior art and an explanation as to how
                           the broadest claim distinguishes over such references. See <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323569">37 CFR
