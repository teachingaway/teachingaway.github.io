                              be examined in the same manner as a non-reissue, non-provisional application,

                              applications. Applications for reissue will be acted on by the examiner in

                              1.176</a></b> provides that an original claim, if re-presented in a reissue

                        being presented for the first time in an original non-reissue, nonprovisional application,
                        except that division will not be required by the examiner. See <b><a href="s1450.html#d0e142607">MPEP §

                           ART
                        </h2>
                        <p id="ch1400_d20021_117d9_6">The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA)
                           revised 35 U.S.C. 102 and thereby, the standard to determine what prior art is available
                           during examination of an application. See Public Law 112-29, 125 Stat. 284 (2011). The
                           changes to 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 in the AIA (first inventor to file provisions) do not
                           apply to any application filed before March 16, 2013. Thus, any application filed before
                           March 16, 2013, is governed by pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103. AIA 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103
                           apply to any patent application that contains or contained at any time a claim to a
                           claimed invention that has an effective filing date that is on or after March 16, 2013.
                           See MPEP §§ 2159 et seq. to determine whether an application is subject to examination
                           under the AIA first inventor to file provisions, and MPEP §§ 2150 et seq. for
                           examination of applications subject to those provisions.
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch1400_d20021_11821_b1">The available prior art that can be applied
                           during the examination of a reissue application is generally the same as that under
                           which the original application was examined. In some cases, however, the reissue is
                           subject to different available prior art than was the original application. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch1400_d20021_11830_2fb">For example, a situation may arise where an
                           application filed April 1, 2013, has a benefit claim to a prior application having a
                           filing date of December 12, 2012, and all claims are fully supported by the 2012
                           application. In this situation, the 2013 application would be examined with respect to
                           the prior art available under pre-AIA35 U.S.C. 102 and 103. If a reissue application is
                           filed on the subsequent patent in which a claim presented must rely on the April 1, 2013
                           disclosure for 35 U.S.C. 112 support (i.e., cannot rely solely on the parent
                           application), that newly presented claim has an effective filing date of April 1, 2013.
                           In this situation, the ENTIRE reissue application is now subject to the prior art
                           available under AIA first inventor to file provisions. See MPEP §§ 2151-2156 for a
                           discussion of the prior art available under the first inventor to file provisions of the
                           AIA. In addition, this reissue application would be subject to pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g),
                           because pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g) applies to each claim of an application for patent, and
                           any patent issued thereon, if such application or patent contains, or contained at any
                           time: (1) A claim to an invention having an effective filing date as defined in 35
                           U.S.C. 100(i) that occurs before March 16, 2013; or (2) a specific reference under 35
                           U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c) to any patent or application that contains, or contained at
                           any time, such a claim. See MPEP § 2159.03.
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch1400_d20021_1183b_324">Another situation may arise in which a
                           benefit claim to an application filed before March 16, 2013, is added in a reissue
                           application based on an AIA patent. If all the claims ever presented in the reissue
                           application and underlying patent are fully supported by the prior application filed
                           before March 16, 2013, then the reissue application would be examined only under pre-AIA
                           35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 because the application was entitled to the benefit of the earlier
                           filed application as evidenced by appropriate benefit claim to the filing date of the
                           prior filed application.
