                           or modification of the Secrecy Order. For example, if the applicant believes that

                           rescind the Order upon expunging this subject matter. The applicant may also petition
                           the Commissioner for Patents for a permit to disclose the invention to another or to
                           modify the Secrecy Order stating fully the reason or purpose for disclosure or
                           modification. An example of such a situation would be a request to file the application
