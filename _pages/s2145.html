                        teaches away from the claimed invention must be considered, but were not probative because

                        subject of the rejection.). For example, rebuttal evidence may include a showing that the
                        prior art fails to disclose or render obvious a method for making the compound, which would
                        preclude a conclusion of obviousness of the compound. A conclusion of obviousness requires
                        that the reference(s) relied upon be enabling in that it put the public in possession of
                        the claimed invention. The court in <i>In re Hoeksema,</i> 399
                        F.2d 269, 274, 158&nbsp;USPQ 596, 601 (CCPA 1968), stated:

                        reasonable correlation between the showing and the entire scope of the claim, when viewed
                        by a skilled artisan. See, e.g., <i>Chupp,</i> 816 F.2d at

                        regardless of the scope of the showing. Usually, a showing of unexpected results is
                        sufficient to overcome a <i>prima facie </i>case of

                        particular use, and where the prior art provides other motivation to select a particular
                        species or subgenus, a showing of a new use may not be sufficient to confer patentability.

                           hematopoietic stem cells were useful for the purpose of hematopoietic reconstitution.
                           PharmaStem’s contribution was to provide experimental proof that umbilical cord and

                           bites. The composition was created from antibody molecules that include three fragments,
                           F(ab)2, F(ab) and F(c), which have separate properties and utilities. There have been
                           commercially available antivenom products that consisted of whole antibodies and F(ab)2
                           fragments, but researchers had not experimented with antivenoms containing only F(ab)
                           fragments because it was believed that their unique properties would prevent them from
                           decreasing the toxicity of snake venom. The inventor, Sullivan, discovered that F(ab)
                           fragments are effective at neutralizing the lethality of rattlesnake venom, while
                           reducing the occurrence of adverse immune reactions in humans. On appeal of the

                           taught by that prior art would have been expected by a person of ordinary skill in the

                           successfully argued that even if the Board had shown a <i>prima facie</i>
                           case of obviousness, the extensive rebuttal evidence must be considered. The evidence
                           included three expert declarations submitted to show that the prior art taught away from
                           the claimed invention, an unexpected property or result from the use of F(ab) fragment
                           antivenom, and why those having ordinary skill in the art expected antivenoms comprising
                           F(ab) fragments to fail. The declarations related to more than the use of the claimed
                           composition. While a statement of intended use may not render a known composition
                           patentable, the claimed composition was not known, and whether it would have been
                           obvious depends upon consideration of the rebuttal evidence. Appellant did not concede
                           that the only distinguishing factor of its composition is the statement of intended use
                           and extensively argued that its claimed composition exhibits the unexpected property of
                           neutralizing the lethality of rattlesnake venom while reducing the occurrence of adverse
                           immune reactions in humans. The Federal Circuit found that such a use and unexpected
                           property cannot be ignored – the unexpected property is relevant and thus the

                           accorded the same weight. In determining the relative weight to accord to rebuttal
                           evidence, considerations such as whether a nexus exists between the claimed invention
                           and the proffered evidence, and whether the evidence is commensurate in scope with the
                           claimed invention, are appropriate. The mere presence of some credible rebuttal evidence
                           does not dictate that an obviousness rejection must always be withdrawn. See

                           </h2>
                           <p id="">At the time the <i>KSR</i> decision was handed down, some
                              observers questioned whether the principles discussed were intended by the Supreme
                              Court to apply to all fields of inventive endeavor. Arguments were made that because
                              the technology at issue in KSR involved the relatively well-developed and predictable
                              field of vehicle pedal assemblies, the decision was relevant only to such fields. The
                              Federal Circuit has soundly repudiated such a notion, stating that
                              <i>KSR</i> applies across technologies:
                           </p>

                              <p id="">This court also declines to cabin KSR to the “predictable arts” (as
                                 opposed to the “unpredictable art” of biotechnology). In fact, this record shows
                                 that one of skill in this advanced art would find these claimed “results”
                                 profoundly “predictable.”
