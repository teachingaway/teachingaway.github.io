                        Aids to Compliance With Duty of Disclosure [R-08.2012]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e196223">While it is not appropriate to attempt
                        to set forth procedures by which attorneys, agents, and other individuals may ensure
                        compliance with the duty of disclosure, the items listed below are offered as examples of
                        possible procedures which could help avoid problems with the duty of disclosure. Though
                        compliance with these procedures may not be required, they are presented as helpful
                        suggestions for avoiding duty of disclosure problems.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196226">1. Many attorneys, both corporate and
                        private, are using letters and questionnaires for applicants and others involved with the
                        filing and prosecution of the application and checklists for themselves and applicants to
                        ensure compliance with the duty of disclosure. The letter generally explains the duty of
                        disclosure and what it means to the inventor and assignee. The questionnaire asks the
                        inventor and assignee questions about
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196229"><sup>__</sup> the origin of the invention and its point of
                        departure from what was previously known and in the prior art,
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196234"><sup>__</sup> possible public uses and
                        sales,
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196239"><sup>__</sup> prior publication, knowledge, patents,
                        foreign patents, etc.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196244">The checklist is used by the attorney
                        to ensure that the applicant has been informed of the duty of disclosure and that the
                        attorney has inquired of and cited material prior art.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196247">The use of these types of aids would
                        appear to be most helpful, though not required, in identifying prior art and may well help
                        the attorney and the client avoid or more easily explain a potentially embarrassing and
                        harmful “fraud” allegation.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196250">2. It is desirable to ask questions
                        about inventorship. Who is the proper inventor? Are there disputes or possible disputes
                        about inventorship? If there are questions, call them to the attention of the U.S. Patent
                        and Trademark Office.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196253">3. It is desirable to ask questions of
                        the inventor about the disclosure of the best mode. Make sure that the best mode is
                        described. See MPEP § <b><a href="s2165.html#d0e216924">2165</a></b> - §&nbsp;<b><a href="s2165.html#d0e217264">2165.04</a></b>.

                        agent to make certain that the inventor, especially a foreign inventor, recognizes his or
                        her responsibilities in signing the oath or declaration. See <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320089">37 CFR

                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196285">5. It is desirable for an attorney or
                        agent to carefully evaluate and explain to the applicant and others involved the scope of
                        the claims, particularly the broadest claims. Ask specific questions about possible prior
                        art which might be material in reference to the broadest claim or claims. There is some
                        tendency to mistakenly evaluate prior art in the light of the gist of what is regarded as
                        the invention or narrower interpretations of the claims, rather than measuring the art
                        against the broadest claim with all of its reasonable interpretations. It is desirable to
                        pick out the broadest claim or claims and measure the materiality of prior art against a
                        reasonably broad interpretation of these claims.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196288">6. It may be useful to evaluate the
                        materiality of prior art or other information from the viewpoint of whether it is the
                        closest prior art or other information. This will tend to put the prior art or other
                        information in better perspective. See <i>Semiconductor Energy
                           Laboratory Co. v. Samsung Electronics Co.</i>, 204 F.3d 1368, 1374, 54 USPQ2d
                        1001, 1005 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (“A withheld reference may be highly material when it discloses
                        a more complete combination of relevant features, even if those features are before the
                        patent examiner in other references.” (citations omitted)). However, <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319407">37 CFR
                              1.56</a></b> may still require the submission of prior art or other
                        information which is not as close as that of record.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196297">7. Care should be taken to see that
                        prior art or other information cited in a specification or in an information disclosure
                        statement is properly described and that the information is not incorrectly or incompletely
                        characterized. It is particularly important for an attorney or agent to review, before
                        filing, an application which was prepared by someone else, e.g., a foreign application. It
                        is also important that an attorney or agent make sure that foreign clients, including
                        foreign applicants, attorneys, and agents understand the requirements of the duty of
                        disclosure, and that the U.S. attorney or agent review any information disclosure
                        statements or citations to ensure that compliance with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319407">37 CFR 1.56</a></b> is
                        present. See<i> Semiconductor Energy Laboratory Co. v. Samsung
                           Electronics Co.</i>, 204 F.3d 1368, 54 USPQ2d 1001 (Fed. Cir. 2000). During
                        prosecution patentee submitted an untranslated 29-page Japanese reference as well as a
                        concise explanation of its relevance and an existing one-page partial English translation,
                        both of which were directed to less material portions of the reference. The untranslated
                        portions of the Japanese reference “contained a more complete combination of the elements
                        claimed [in the patent] than anything else before the&nbsp;PTO.” 204 F.3d at 1374, 54 USPQ2d at
                        1005. The patentee, whose native language was Japanese, was held to have understood the
                        materiality of the reference. “The duty of candor does not require that the applicant
                        translate every foreign reference, but only that the applicant refrain from submitting
                        partial translations and concise explanations that it knows will misdirect the examiner’s
                        attention from the reference’s relevant teaching.” 204 F.3d at 1378, 54&nbsp;USPQ2d at 1008. See
                        also <i>Gemveto Jewelry Co. v. Lambert Bros., Inc</i>., 542 F.
                        Supp. 933, 216 USPQ 976 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) wherein a patent was held invalid or unenforceable
                        because patentee’s foreign counsel did not disclose to patentee’s United States counsel or
                        to the Office prior art cited by the Dutch Patent Office in connection with the patentee’s
                        corresponding Dutch application. The court stated, 542 F. Supp. at 943, 216&nbsp;USPQ at
                        985:

                        inaccurate statements or inaccurate experiments are not introduced into the specification,
                        either inadvertently or intentionally. For example, stating that an experiment “was run” or
                        “was conducted” when in fact the experiment was not run or conducted is a misrepresentation
                        of the facts. No results should be represented as actual results unless they have actually
                        been achieved. Paper or prophetic examples should not be described using the past tense.
                        <i>Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Promega Corp.</i>, 323 F.3d
                        1354, 1367, 66 USPQ2d 1385, 1394 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also<b><a href="s608.html#d0e46258">MPEP

                        misrepresentations can occur when experiments which were run or conducted are inaccurately
                        reported in the specification, e.g., an experiment is changed by leaving out one or more
                        ingredients. See <i>Steierman v. Connelly</i>, 192 USPQ 433
                        (Bd. Pat. Int. 1975); 192 USPQ 446 (Bd. Pat. Int. 1976).
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196340">9. Do not rely on the examiner of a
                        particular application to be aware of other applications belonging to the same applicant or
                        assignee. It is desirable to call such applications to the attention of the examiner even
                        if there is only a question that they might be “material to patentability” of the
                        application the examiner is considering. See <i>Dayco Prod., Inc. v.
                           Total Containment, Inc.</i>, 329 F.3d 1358, 1365-69, 66 USPQ2d 1801, 1806-08 (Fed.
                        Cir. 2003) (contrary decision of another examiner reviewing substantially similar claims is
                        ‘material’; copending application may be ‘material’ even though it cannot result in a
                        shorter patent term, when it could affect the rights of the patentee to assign the issued
                        patents). It is desirable to be particularly careful that prior art or other information in
                        one application is cited to the examiner in other applications to which it would be
                        material. Do not assume that an examiner will necessarily remember, when examining a
                        particular application, other applications which the examiner is examining, or has
                        examined. A “lapse on the part of the examiner does not excuse the applicant.”<i>KangaROOS U.S.A., Inc. v. Caldor, Inc.</i>, 778 F.2d 1571, 1576,
                        228 USPQ 32, 35 (Fed. Cir. 1985); see also MPEP §&nbsp;<b><a href="s2001.html#d0e195865">2001.06(b).</a></b></p>
                     <p id="d0e196364">10. When in doubt, it is desirable and
                        safest to submit information. Even though the attorney, agent, or applicant doesn’t
                        consider it necessarily material, someone else may see it differently and embarrassing
                        questions can be avoided. The court in <i>U.S. Industries v. Norton
                           Co.</i>, 210 USPQ 94, 107 (N.D. N.Y. 1980) stated “In short, the question of
                        relevancy in close cases, should be left to the examiner and not the applicant.” See also

                        significance should submit same early in prosecution, e.g., before the first action by the
                        examiner, and not wait until after allowance. Potentially material information discovered
                        late in the prosecution should be immediately submitted. That the issue fee has been paid
                        is no reason or excuse for failing to submit information. See <i>Elmwood Liquid Products, Inc.</i><i>v. Singleton Packing Corp</i>., 328 F. Supp. 974, 170 USPQ

                        submission of long lists of documents if it can be avoided. Eliminate clearly irrelevant
                        and marginally pertinent cumulative information. If a long list is submitted, highlight
                        those documents which have been specifically brought to applicant’s attention and/or are
                        known to be of most significance. See <i>Penn Yan Boats, Inc. v. Sea
                           Lark Boats, Inc</i>., 359 F. Supp. 948, 175 USPQ 260 (S.D. Fla. 1972), <i>aff’d,</i> 479 F.2d 1338, 178 USPQ 577 (5th Cir. 1973), <i>cert. denied,</i> 414 U.S. 874 (1974). But cf. <i>Molins PLC v.</i><i>Textron Inc.</i>, 48 F.3d 1172, 33 USPQ2d 1823 (Fed. Cir.

                        might have been bad or something might have been overlooked inadvertently, a note made at
                        the time of evaluation might be an invaluable aid in explaining that the mistake was honest
                        and excusable. Though such records are not required, they could be helpful in recalling and
                        explaining actions in the event of a question of “fraud” or “inequitable conduct” raised at
