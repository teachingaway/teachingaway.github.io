                           a patent, all amendments to the patent claims and all claims added during the proceeding
                           are withdrawn. This is carried out by placing a diagonal line across all amended and new

                           patent owner should be notified of this in the next Office action. The Office action
                           will hold the amendments to be improper, and state that all subsequent reexamination
                           will be on the basis of the unamended patent claims. This procedure is necessary since
