Jerry Derevyanny litigates cases that present challenging or novel issues at the boundary between technology and the law. He also counsels entrepreneurs and companies on strategies for minimizing litigation risk. As a first-generation American, Jerry knows first-hand the challenges of building a successful business from the ground up. He therefore takes a pragmatic, bottom-line-oriented approach to resolving disputes.

Prior to joining Adler Vermillion & Skocilich LLP, Jerry practiced complex commercial litigation at Kaye Scholer LLP, where he contributed to the defense and prosecution of high-value, multi-jurisdictional lawsuits. Jerry also devotes a substantial amount of time to pro bono work ranging from death penalty appeals to open source software-related projects.

While currently practicing out of the New York office, Jerry is originally from the Seattle area and is frequent visitor in the Seattle office. Jerry also speaks fluent Russian.
