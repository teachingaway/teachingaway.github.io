                        Identifying and Interpreting a 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or Pre-AIA 35
                        U.S.C. 112, Sixth Paragraph Limitation [R-11.2013]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e219290">This section sets forth guidelines for the examination of
                        <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec">35

                        “means or step plus function” limitations in a claim. These guidelines are based on the
                        Office’s current understanding of the law and are believed to be fully consistent with
                        binding precedent of the Supreme Court, the Federal Circuit and the Federal Circuit’s
                        predecessor courts. These guidelines do not constitute substantive rulemaking and hence do
                        not have the force and effect of law. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e219296">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in its <i>en banc</i> decision <i>In re</i><i>Donaldson Co.,</i> 16 F.3d 1189, 1194, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1850
                        (Fed. Cir. 1994), held that a “means-or-step-plus-function” limitation should be
                        interpreted as follows:
                     </p>
                     <blockquote id="d0e219329">
                        <p id="d0e219330">Per our holding, the “broadest reasonable interpretation”
                           that an examiner may give means-plus-function language is that statutorily mandated in
                           paragraph six. Accordingly, the PTO may not disregard the structure disclosed in the
                           specification corresponding to such language when rendering a patentability
                           determination.

                     <p id="ch2100_d222e6_d8fe_1c0">Therefore, the broadest reasonable interpretation
                        of a claim limitation that invokes <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec">35 U.S.C. 112(f)</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
                              112</a></b>, sixth paragraph, is the structure, material or act described in the
                        specification as performing the entire claimed function and equivalents to the disclosed
                        structure, material or act. As a result, <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec">section 112(f)</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">pre-AIA section 112</a></b>,
                        sixth paragraph, limitations will, in some cases, be afforded a more narrow interpretation
                        than a limitation that is not crafted in “means plus function” format.

                           the patentee, not the public, who must bear the cost of failure to seek protection for

                        <p id=""> If a claim limitation recites a term and associated functional language,
                           the examiner should determine whether the claim limitation invokes <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec">35 U.S.C.
                                 112(f)</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, sixth
                           paragraph. The claim limitation is presumed to invoke <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec">35 U.S.C.
                                 112(f)</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, sixth
                           paragraph when it explicitly uses the term “means” or “step” and includes functional
                           language. That presumption is overcome when the limitation further includes the
                           structure necessary to perform the recited function. <i>TriMed, Inc. v. Stryker
                              Corp.,</i> 514 F.3d 1256, 1259-60, 85 USPQ2d 1787, 1789 (Fed. Cir. 2008)
                           (“Sufficient structure exists when the claim language specifies the exact structure that
                           performs the function in question without need to resort to other portions of the
                           specification or extrinsic evidence for an adequate understanding of the structure.”);
                           see also <i>Altiris, Inc. v. Symantec Corp.,</i> 318 F.3d 1363, 1376, 65
                           USPQ2d 1865, 1874 (Fed. Cir. 2003).
                        </p>
                        <p id=""> By contrast, a claim limitation that does not use the term “means” or
                           “step” will trigger the rebuttable presumption that <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec">35 U.S.C.
                                 112(f)</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, sixth
                           paragraph does not apply. See, e.g., <i>Phillips v. AWH Corp.,</i> 415 F.3d
                           1303, 1310, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2005) <i>(en banc)</i>;
                           <i>CCS Fitness, Inc. v. Brunswick Corp.,</i> 288 F.3d 1359, 1369, 62
                           USPQ2d 1658, 1664 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <i>Personalized Media Commc’ns, LLC v.
                              ITC,</i> 161 F.3d 696, 703-04, 48 USPQ2d 1880, 1886–87 (Fed. Cir. 1998). This
                           presumption is a strong one that is not readily overcome. <i>Lighting World, Inc.
                              v. Birchwood Lighting, Inc.,</i> 382 F.3d 1354, 1358, 72 USPQ2d 1344, 1348
                           (2004); <i>Inventio AG v. Thyssenkrupp Elevator Americas Corp.,</i> 649 F.3d
                           1350, 1356, 99 USPQ2d 1112, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2011). This strong presumption may be
                           overcome if the claim limitation is shown to use a non-structural term that is “a nonce
                           word or a verbal construct that is not recognized as the name of structure” but is
                           merely a substitute for the term “means” associated with functional language.
                           <i>Lighting World,</i> 382 F.3d at 1360, 72 USPQ2d at 1350. The
                           substitute term in such cases acts as a generic placeholder for the term “means” and
                           would not be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art as being sufficiently
                           definite structure for performing the claimed function.

                           description and/or not be sufficiently enabled to support the full scope of the claim.
                           The principle function of claims is to provide notice of the boundaries of the right to
                           exclude by defining the limits of the invention, and means-plus-function claims rely on
                           the disclosure to define those limits. Accordingly, an inadequate disclosure may give
                           rise to both an indefiniteness rejection for a means-plus-function limitation and a
                           failure to satisfy the written description and enablement requirements of

                           that “The problem is especially acute with genus claims that use functional language to
                           define the boundaries of a claimed genus. In such a case, the functional claim may
                           simply claim a desired result, and may do so without describing species that achieve
                           that result. But the specification must demonstrate that the applicant has made a

                           means-plus-function limitation as the only limitation of a claim. The long-recognized
                           problem with a single means claim is that it covers every conceivable means for
                           achieving the stated result, while the specification discloses at most only those means
                           known to the inventor. <i>In re</i><i>Hyatt,</i> 708 F.2d 712, 218 USPQ 195 (Fed. Cir. 1983).
                           A single means claim does not comply with <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5">35 U.S.C.

                           scope with the claim under consideration. As <i>Donaldson</i> applies only to an interpretation of a limitation drafted to

                           to “an element in a claim for a combination.” Therefore, single means claims that do not
                           recite a combination cannot invoke <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec">section 112(f)</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">pre-AIA section

                           limitation that is properly construed will cover all means of performing the claimed
                           function. A claim of such breadth reads on subject matter that is not enabled by the

                           claim construction used by the examiner during prosecution. Also, if the applicant
                           intends a different claim construction, the issue can be clarified early in prosecution.

                        <p id="ch2100_d1b1ae_1e757_161">The presumptions noted above are as follows.
                           The first presumption is that use of the word “means” or "step" in a claim creates a
                           rebuttable presumption that the claim element is to be treated in accordance with
                           <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec">35

                           paragraph. The presumption is rebutted when “means” or "step" is not modified by
                           function or when the function is recited with sufficient structure or material within
                           the claim itself to perform the recited function. The second presumption is that absence
                           of the word “means” or "step" in a claim creates a rebuttable presumption that the claim
                           element is not to be treated in accordance with <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec">35 U.S.C.

                           paragraph. The presumption is rebutted when the claim element recites function but fails
                           to recite sufficiently definite structure or material to perform that function. See
                           <b><a href="s706.html#d0e66074">MPEP §
                                 706.03</a></b> for applicable form paragraphs. Additionally, if the
                           corresponding structure for the claimed function is not clearly identifiable in the
                           specification, the Office action should, nevertheless, attempt to identify what
                           structure is most closely associated with the means- (or step-) plus-function limitation
                           to facilitate a prior art search. This is especially true when there may be confusion as
                           to which disclosed implementation of the invention supports the limitation, as explained
                           in subsection II.B., above.
