                        			to inventions which have not been searched by the International Searching Authority will
                        			not be considered by the International Preliminary Examining Authority. If the examiner

                        			PCT/IPEA/405. Such an invitation will include the identification of what the examiner
                        			considers to be the โmain inventionโ which will be examined if no additional fees are
                        			paid or restriction is made by the applicant.
