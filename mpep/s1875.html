                        			which have been searched by the International Searching Authority. All claims directed
                        			to inventions which have not been searched by the International Searching Authority will
                        			not be considered by the International Preliminary Examining Authority. If the examiner

                        			the claims to be examined, an invitation is normally prepared and sent to the applicant

                        			PCT/IPEA/405. Such an invitation will include the identification of what the examiner
                        			considers to be the “main invention” which will be examined if no additional fees are
                        			paid or restriction is made by the applicant.
