                        <p id="ch2200_d1fddd_22ea1_111">The patent owner may seek review on the
                           examiner's SNQ determination before the Board along with any appeal of the examiner's
                           rejections. To obtain review of the SNQ issue, patent owner must include the SNQ issue
                           and the appropriate arguments in its appeal brief to the Board. In order to preserve the
                           right to have the Board review of the SNQ issue, a patent owner must have first
                           requested reconsideration of the SNQ issue by the examiner. Accordingly, for <i>ex
                              parte</i> reexamination proceedings ordered on or after June 25, 2010, the
                           patent owner may seek a final agency decision from the Board on the SNQ issue only if
                           the patent owner has first requested reconsideration before the examiner (e.g., in a
                           patent owner's statement under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e330194">37 CFR 1.530</a></b> or in a patent owner's
                           response under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322449">37 CFR
                                 1.111</a></b>) and then seeks review of the examiner's SNQ determination
                           before the Board. In its appeal brief, the patent owner is to clearly present the issue
                           and arguments regarding the examiner's SNQ determination under a separate heading and
                           identify the communication in which the patent owner first requested reconsideration
                           before the examiner. (For <i>ex parte</i> reexamination proceedings ordered
                           prior to June 25, 2010, if the patent owner presents the SNQ issue in its appeal brief,
                           the Board panel will review the procedural SNQ issue along with its review of any
                           rejections in an appeal and will enter a final agency decision accordingly.)

                        <p id="ch2200_d1fddd_23935_22d">Since May 25, 2010, the Board of Patent
                           Appeals and Interferences (BPAI), now the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, (Board), has
                           the sole responsibility for determining whether appeal briefs filed in <i>ex
                              parte</i> reexamination proceedings comply with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356598">37 CFR 41.37</a></b>, and
                           will complete the determination before the appeal brief is forwarded to the examiner for
                           consideration. The determination should be completed within approximately one month from
                           the filing of the appeal brief. If the appeal brief is determined to be compliant with
                           the rules or it contains only minor informalities that do not affect the Board panel’s
                           ability to render a decision, the Board will accept the appeal brief and forward it to
                           the examiner for consideration. If the Board determines that the appeal brief is
                           non-compliant with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356598">37
                                 CFR 41.37</a></b> and sends appellant a notice of non-compliant brief
                           requiring a corrected brief, appellant will be required to file a corrected brief within
                           the time period set forth in the notice to avoid the dismissal of the appeal. The Board
                           also has the sole responsibility for determining whether corrected briefs comply with
                           <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356598">37 CFR
                                 41.37</a></b>, and addresses any inquiries and petitions regarding notices
                           of non-compliant briefs.
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch2200_d1fddd_24c4a_ed">Once an appeal brief is accepted by the Board
                           as in compliance with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356598">37 CFR 41.37</a></b>, the appeal brief will not later be held as
                           defective by the CRU or the examiner. The Board will not return or remand the proceeding
                           to the examiner for issues related to a non-compliant appeal brief. Furthermore,
                           examiners are not required to review appeal briefs for the purposes of determining
                           whether the appeal briefs comply with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356598">37 CFR 41.37</a></b>. Accordingly, the
                           Notification of Non-Compliant Appeal Brief (PTOL-462R) and form paragraphs for holding
                           an appeal brief defective are no longer be available in OACS for the CRU to
                           use.
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch2200_d1fddd_24d9b_17e">Examiners are no longer to hold any appeal
                           briefs defective. Rather, the Board will correspond directly with the appellant on
                           non-compliant brief issues. In a rare situation where an appeal brief contains serious
                           defects that will prevent the examiner from drafting an examiner’s answer, the examiner
                           should report the issue to the Director of CRU who will communicate with the Board
                           regarding the issue if appropriate.
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch2200_d1fddd_24e71_1a6">In addition, examiners are not required to
                           make any determination whether fewer than all of the rejected claims are identified by
                           the appellant as being appealed. If the notice of appeal or appeal brief identifies
                           fewer than all of the rejected claims as being appealed, the issue will be addressed by
                           the Board panel. Therefore, the examiner will treat all pending, rejected claims as
                           being on appeal, and the examiner must maintain all of the rejections set forth in the
                           Office action from which the appeal is taken, unless appellant has overcome the
                           rejection (e.g., by submitting persuasive arguments, an acceptable terminal disclaimer,
                           or evidence). In situations where the appellant makes a request to hold a rejection in
                           abeyance or did not present any argument on a rejection in the appeal brief, the
                           examiner should maintain the rejection in the examiner’s answer. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch2200_d1fddd_25051_5">The responsibility of the Board for determining
                           whether appeal briefs comply with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356598">37 CFR 41.37</a></b> is not considered a
                           transfer of jurisdiction when an appeal brief is filed, but rather is only a transfer of
                           the specific responsibility of notifying appellants under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356721">37 CFR 41.37(d)</a></b> of
                           the reasons for non-compliance. The CRU retains the jurisdiction over the reexamination
                           proceeding to consider the appeal brief, conduct an appeal conference, draft an
                           examiner’s answer, and decide the entry of amendments, evidence, and information
                           disclosure statements filed after final or after the filing of a notice of appeal.
                           Furthermore, petitions concerning the refusal to enter amendments and/or evidence remain
                           delegated as per <b><a href="s1002.html#d0e116658">MPEP §§
                                 1002.02(b)</a></b> and <b><a href="s1002.html#d0e116970">1002.02(c)</a></b>. The jurisdiction of the
                           <i>ex parte</i> reexamination proceeding is transferred to the Board when
                           a docketing notice is entered after the time period for filing a reply brief expires or
                           the examiner acknowledges the receipt and entry of the reply brief.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e233685">It is to be noted that the mere
                           filing of any paper whatsoever entitled as a brief cannot necessarily be considered as
                           compliance with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356598">37 CFR 41.37</a></b>. The rule requires that
                           the brief must set forth the authorities and arguments relied on, and to the extent that
                           it fails to do so with respect to any ground of rejection, that ground may be summarily
                           sustained. A distinction must be made between the lack of any argument and the
                           presentation of arguments that carry no conviction. In the former case summarily
                           sustaining the rejection is in order, while in the latter case a decision on the merits
                           is made, although it may well be merely an affirmance based on the grounds relied on by
                           the examiner.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e233691">Appellant must traverse <i>every</i> ground of rejection set forth in the final rejection
                           that appellant is presenting for review in the appeal. Oral argument at the hearing will
                           not remedy a deficiency of failure to traverse a ground of rejection in the brief.
                           Ignoring or acquiescing in any rejection, even one based upon formal matters which could
                           be cured by subsequent amendment, will invite summarily affirmance of the
                           rejection.

                        <p id="d0e233697">The reexamination prosecution is
                           considered terminated as of the date of the dismissal of the appeal. After the appeal is
                           dismissed, the examiner will proceed to issue a Notice of Intent to Issue <i>Ex Parte</i> Reexamination Certificate for the proceeding; see
