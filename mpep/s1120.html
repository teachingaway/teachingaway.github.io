                           there are many instances in which the Office mails a notice of allowance in an

                           abandonment due to failure to pay the issue fee, or withdrawal from issue). Therefore,
                           the Office will not discontinue the pre-grant publication process until a patent has
                           actually issued. Since the Office cannot discontinue the pre-grant publication process
                           during the last two to four weeks of the publication process, this will result in a few

                           eighteen months from the earliest filing date claimed; or (2) fourteen weeks from the
                           mailing date of the filing receipt. The publication process takes about fourteen weeks.
                           Publication occurs on Thursday of each week.

                           promptly review their filing receipts. Applicants should promptly file a request for
                           corrected filing receipt if the information on the filing receipt needs to be corrected.
                           In addition, applicants should contact the Office of Data Management – Patent
                           Publication Branch (see <b><a href="s1730.html#d0e163385">MPEP § 1730</a></b>) if the projected

                           application that should not be published. Applicants should also promptly check any
                           priority or benefit claims provided on the filing receipt and timely file or correct any
                           priority or benefit claims if the filing receipt does not include the desired claims or
                           includes incorrect claims. If the information is incorrect, Applicants should promptly
                           file a request for corrected filing receipt to assist the Office in quickly processing
                           the change prior to export of the application to the publisher. This will avoid the need
                           to file a petition under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319215">37 CFR 1.55</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320662">1.78</a></b> to accept unintentionally delayed claims and the surcharge

                           the Office cannot change the projected publication date and include the corrections in
