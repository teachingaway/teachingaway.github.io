                           of record, if any, can sign an express abandonment. It is imperative that the attorney
                           or agent of record exercise every precaution in ascertaining that the abandonment of the
                           application is in accordance with the desires and best interests of the applicant prior
                           to signing a letter of express abandonment of a patent application. Moreover, special
                           care should be taken to ensure that the appropriate application is correctly identified
                           in the letter of abandonment.

                           later date if so specified in the letter itself. For example, where a continuing
                           application is filed with a request to abandon the prior application as of the filing
                           date accorded the continuing application, the date of the abandonment of the prior
                           application will be in accordance with the request once it is

                                    that the Office should mail a new Notice of Allowance in view of the evidence
                                    presented in support of the contention that the applicant’s representative did
                                    not receive the original Notice of Allowance. Under the reasoning of <i>Delgar</i>, an allegation that an Office action was
                                    never received may be considered in a petition to withdraw the holding of
                                    abandonment. If adequately supported, the Office may grant the petition to
                                    withdraw the holding of abandonment and remail the Office action. That is, the

                                    abandonment (or not reply) was unavoidable or unintentional. When the applicant

                           <p id="d0e84159">The Patent Examining Corps
                              currently mails to the correspondence address of record, a Notice of Abandonment form
                              PTOL-1432 in all applications which become abandoned for failure to prosecute.
                              However, in no case will mere failure to receive a notice of abandonment affect the
                              status of an abandoned application.

                              applicants to take appropriate and diligent action to reinstate an application
                              inadvertently abandoned for failure to timely reply to an official communication. In
                              most cases, a petition to revive under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323800">37 CFR 1.137</a></b> will
                              be the appropriate remedy. It may be that a reply to the Office action was mailed to
                              the Office with a certificate of mailing declaration as a part thereof
                              (<b><a href="s512.html#d0e32635">MPEP § 512</a></b>) but was not received in the Office. In this
                              instance, adequate relief may be available by means of a petition to withdraw the
                              holding of abandonment. See <b><a href="s711.html#d0e81972">MPEP § 711.03(c)</a></b>.

                              be granted. If a lack of diligent action is predicated on the contention that neither
                              the Office action nor the notice of abandonment was received, one may presume that
                              there is a problem with the correspondence address of record. Accordingly, attention
