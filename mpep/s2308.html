                        the examiner should reject any claim for which allowance would be inconsistent with the
                        interference judgment.

                              must be rejected as procedurally estopped. Even though the applicant was not

                              because the applicant’s inability to obtain relief in the interference was the result
                              of the applicant’s failure to seek timely relief.
