                        Final Action [R-11.2013]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e232889">Before a final action is in order, a
                        clear issue should be developed between the examiner and the patent owner. To bring the
                        prosecution to a speedy conclusion and at the same time deal justly with the patent owner
                        and the public, the examiner will twice provide the patent owner with such information and
                        references as may be useful in defining the position of the Office as to unpatentability
                        before the action is made final. Initially, the decision ordering reexamination of the
                        patent will contain an identification of the new questions of patentability that the
                        examiner considers to be raised by the prior art considered. In addition, the first Office
                        action will reflect the consideration of any arguments and/or amendments contained in the
                        request, the owner’s statement filed pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e330194">37 CFR 1.530</a></b>, and any
                        reply thereto by the requester, and should fully apply all relevant grounds of rejection to
                        the claims.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e232895">The statement which the patent owner
                        may file under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e330194">37 CFR 1.530</a></b> and the response to the
                        first Office action should completely respond to and/or amend with a view to avoiding all
                        outstanding grounds of rejection.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e232901">It is intended that the second Office
                        action in the reexamination proceeding following the decision ordering reexamination will
                        generally be made final. The criteria for making a rejection final in an <i>ex parte</i> reexamination proceeding is analogous to that set
                        forth in <b><a href="s706.html#d0e68889">MPEP § 706.07(a)</a></b> for making a rejection final in an application.
                        Both the patent owner and the examiner should recognize that a reexamination proceeding may
                        result in the final cancellation of claims from the patent and that the patent owner does
                        not have the right to renew or continue the proceedings by refiling under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e318681">37 CFR
                              1.53(b)</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e318862">37 CFR 1.53(d)</a></b> or former 37 CFR 1.60 or
                        1.62, nor by filing a request for continued examination under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322625">37 CFR
                              1.114</a></b>. Complete and thorough actions by the examiner coupled with
                        complete responses by the patent owner, including early presentation of evidence under
                        <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323512">37 CFR
                              1.131(a)</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552">37 CFR 1.132</a></b>, will go far in avoiding
                        such problems and reaching a desirable early termination of the reexamination prosecution. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e232927">In making the final rejection, all
                        outstanding grounds of rejection of record should be carefully reviewed and any grounds or
                        rejection relied on should be reiterated. The grounds of rejection must (in the final
                        rejection) be clearly developed to such an extent that the patent owner may readily judge
                        the advisability of an appeal. However, where a single previous Office action contains a
                        complete statement of a ground of rejection, the final rejection may refer to such a
                        statement and also should include a rebuttal of any arguments raised in the patent owner’s
                        response.

                        <p id="d0e232934">After an examiner has determined

                           will set up a panel review conference as per <b><a href="s2271.html#d0e233154">MPEP § 2271.01</a></b>, to discuss the issuance
                           of the action. The examiner may prepare the action after the conference, or may prepare
                           the action prior to the conference and revise it as needed after the conference.

                           Reexamination Unit (CRU) support staff notices) will not be reviewed by a

                              or more, members, one of whom will be a manager. The second member will be the
                              examiner in charge of the proceeding. The manager will select the third member. The
                              examiner-conferees will be primary examiners, or examiners who are knowledgeable in
                              the technology of the invention claimed in the patent being reexamined and/or who are
                              experienced in reexamination practice. The majority of those present at the
                              conference will be examiners who were not involved in the examination or issuance of
                              the patent. An “original” examiner (see <b><a href="s2236.html#d0e224767">MPEP § 2236</a></b>) should
                              be chosen as a conferee only if that examiner is the most knowledgeable in the art,
                              or there is some other specific and justifiable reason to choose an original examiner
                              as a participant in the conference.

                              panel and the members will confer and review the patentability of the claim(s). If
                              the conference confirms the examiner’s preliminary decision to reject and/or allow
                              the claims, the Office action shall be issued and signed by the examiner, with the
                              two, or more, other conferees initialing the action (as “conferee”) to indicate their
                              participation in the conference. All conferees will initial, even though one of them
                              may have dissented from the 3-party conference decision as to the patentabiliy of
                              claims. If the conference does not confirm the examiner’s preliminary decision,
                              examiner will reevaluate and issue an appropriate Office action.

                              forum to consider all issues of patentability as well as procedural issues having an
                              impact on patentability. Review of the patentability of the claims by more than one
                              primary examiner should diminish the perception that the patent owner can
                              disproportionately influence the examiner in charge of the proceeding. The
                              conferences will also provide greater assurance that all matters will be addressed
                              appropriately. All issues in the proceeding will be viewed from the perspectives of
                              three examiners. What the examiner in charge of the proceeding might have missed, the
                              other two, or more, conference members would likely detect. The conference will
                              provide for a comprehensive discussion of, and finding for, each
                              issue.

                              wishes to object must promptly file a paper alerting the Office of this fact. (The
                              failure to provide panel review would be noted by the parties where there are no
                              conferees’ initials at the end of the Office action.) Any challenge of the failure to
                              hold a panel review conference must be made within two weeks of receipt of the Office
                              action issued, or the challenge will not be considered. In no event will the failure
                              to hold a panel review conference, by itself, be grounds for vacating any Office
                              decision(s) or action(s) and “restarting” the reexamination
                              proceeding.
