                              EXAMINATION.—A patent owner may request supplemental examination of a patent in
                              the Office to consider, reconsider, or correct information believed to be
                              relevant to the patent, in accordance with such requirements as the Director
                              may establish. Within 3 months after the date a request for supplemental
                              examination meeting the requirements of this section is received, the Director
                              shall conduct the supplemental examination and shall conclude such examination
                              by issuing a certificate indicating whether the information presented in the
                              request raises a substantial new question of patentability. 
                           </li>

                              request, the Director shall order reexamination of the patent. The
                              reexamination shall be conducted according to procedures established by chapter
                              30, except that the patent owner shall not have the right to file a statement
                              pursuant to section 304. During the reexamination, the Director shall address
                              each substantial new question of patentability identified during the
                              supplemental examination, notwithstanding the limitations in chapter 30

                              chapter.
