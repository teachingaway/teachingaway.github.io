                           ordered. The meaning and scope of the term “a substantial new question of patentability”
                           is not defined in the statute and must be developed to some extent on a case-by-case

                           decided by (A) a final holding of invalidity, after all appeals, or (B) by the Office in
                           a previous examination of the patent. A “previous examination” of the patent is: (A) the
                           original examination of the application which matured into the patent; (B) the
                           examination of the patent in a reissue application that has resulted in a reissue of the

                              concluded</i> reexamination. The answer to the question of whether a
                           “substantial new question of patentability” exists, and therefore whether reexamination
                           may be had, is decided by the examiner, and the examiner’s determination may be

                           publication raises a substantial question of patentability where there is a substantial
                           likelihood that a reasonable examiner would consider the prior art patent or printed
                           publication important in deciding whether or not the claim is patentable. If the prior
                           art patents and/or publications would be considered important, then the examiner should
                           find “a substantial new question of patentability” unless the same question of
                           patentability has already been decided as to the claim in a final holding of invalidity
                           by the Federal court system or by the Office in a previous examination. For example, the
                           same question of patentability may have already been decided by the Office where the
                           examiner finds the additional (newly provided) prior art patents or printed publications
                           are merely cumulative to similar prior art already fully considered by the Office in a
                           previous examination of the claim.

                           patentability” to be present, it is only necessary that: (A) the prior art patents
                           and/or printed publications raise a substantial question of patentability regarding at
                           least one claim, i.e., the teaching of the (prior art) patents and printed publications
                           is such that a reasonable examiner would consider the teaching to be <span class="Underline">important</span> in deciding whether or not the claim is
                           patentable; and (B) the same question of patentability as to the claim has not been
                           decided by the Office in a concluded previous examination of the patent, raised to or by
                           the Office in a pending reexamination of the patent, or decided in a final holding of
                           invalidity by the Federal Courts in a decision on the merits involving the claim. If a
                           reexamination proceeding was terminated/vacated without resolving the substantial
                           question of patentability question, it can be re-presented in a new reexamination
                           request. It is not necessary that a “<i>prima facie</i>”
                           case of unpatentability exist as to the claim in order for “a substantial new question
                           of patentability” to be present as to the claim. Thus, “a substantial new question of
                           patentability” as to a patent claim could be present even if the examiner would not
                           necessarily reject the claim as either fully anticipated by, or obvious in view of, the
                           prior art patents or printed publications. As to the importance of the difference
                           between “a substantial new question of patentability” and a “<i>prima facie</i>” case of unpatentability see generally <i>In re Etter, </i>756 F.2d 852, 857 n.5, 225&nbsp;USPQ 1, 4 n.5

                           the second or subsequent requester must independently provide a substantial new question

                           patentability is not provided by the second or subsequent request for the claims in
                           effect at the time of the determination, the second or subsequent request for
                           reexamination must be denied since the Office is only authorized by statute to grant a
                           reexamination proceeding based on a substantial new question of patentability “affecting
                           any claim of the patent.” See <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306491">35 U.S.C. 303</a></b>. Accordingly, there
                           must be at least one substantial new question of patentability established for the
                           existing claims in the patent in order to grant reexamination.

                           The information directed to a proposed new or amended claim in the pending reexamination
                           is addressed during the later filed reexamination (where a substantial new question is
                           raised in the later reexamination for the existing claims in the patent), in order to
                           permit examination of the entire patent package. When a proper basis for the subsequent
                           reexamination is established, it would be a waste of resources to prevent addressing the
                           proposed new or amended claims, by requiring parties to wait until the certificate
                           issues for the proposed new or amended claims, and only then to file a new reexamination
                           request challenging the claims as revised via the certificate. This also prevents a
                           patent owner from simply amending all the claims in some nominal fashion to preclude a
                           subsequent reexamination request during the pendency of the reexamination
