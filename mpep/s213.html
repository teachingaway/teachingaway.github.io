                           known as the right of priority in international patent law and this phrase has been
                           adopted in the U.S. statute. The right of priority originated in a multilateral treaty
                           of 1883, to which the United States adhered in 1887, known as the Paris Convention for
                           the Protection of Industrial Property (Paris Convention). The treaty is administered by
                           the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) at Geneva, Switzerland. This treaty
                           has been revised several times, the latest revision in effect being written in Stockholm
                           in July 1967 (copy at Appendix P of this Manual). Articles 13-30 of the Stockholm
                           Revision became effective on September 5, 1970. Articles 1-12 of the Stockholm Revision
                           became effective on August 25, 1973. One of the many provisions of the treaty requires
                           each of the adhering countries to accord the right of priority to the nationals of the
                           other countries and the first United States statute relating to this subject was enacted
                           to carry out this obligation. There is another treaty between the United States and some
                           Latin American countries which also provides for the right of priority. A foreign
                           country may also provide for this right by reciprocal legislation.

                              the incorporation by reference statement can be relied upon to permit the entering of

                           <p id="ch200_d1ff72_1b3f8_388">Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119(a), the foreign
                              application must have been filed by the same applicant as the applicant in the United
                              States, or by his or her legal representatives or assigns. Consistent with
                              longstanding Office policy, this is interpreted to mean that the U.S. and foreign
                              applications must name the same inventor or have at least one joint inventor in
                              common. For example, a right of priority does not exist in the case of an application
                              of sole inventor A in the foreign country and sole inventor B in the United States,
                              even though the two applications may be owned by the same party. The application in
                              the foreign country may have been filed by the assignee, or by the legal
                              representative or agent of the inventor, rather than by the inventor, but in such
                              cases the name of the inventor is usually given in the foreign application on a paper
                              filed therein. Joint inventors A and B in a nonprovisional application filed in the
                              United States Patent and Trademark Office may properly claim the benefit of an
                              application filed in a foreign country by A and another application filed in a
                              foreign country by B, i.e., A and B may each claim the benefit of their foreign filed

                           with PCT Rule 17 during the international phase, the International Bureau will forward a
                           copy of the certified priority document to each Designated Office that has requested a
                           copy of the foreign priority document and the copy received from the International

                           priority document. See MPEP § 1893.03(c). If, however, the International Bureau is

                           document exchange program during the national stage to fulfill the requirements of 37
