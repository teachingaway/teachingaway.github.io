                              full faith and credit should be given to the search and action of the previous
                              examiner unless there is a clear error in the previous action or knowledge of other
                              prior art. In general the second examiner should not take an entirely new approach to
                              the application or attempt to reorient the point of view of the previous examiner, or
                              make a new search in the mere hope of finding something. See <b><a href="s719.html#d0e94319">MPEP §
