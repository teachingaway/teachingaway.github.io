                        come from an applicant or from an examiner. Who suggests the interference determines what
                        must be done and shown prior to declaration of an interference. In either circumstance, the
                        examiner must consult with an Interference Practice Specialist (IPS), who may then refer
                        the suggested interference to the Board of Patent Appeals and
                        Interferences.

                           <p id="d0e238618">When an application is in
                              condition for allowance, an interference search must be made by performing a text
                              search of the “US-PGPUB” database in EAST or WEST directed to the comprehensive
                              inventive features in the broadest claim. If the application contains a claim
                              directed to a nucleotide or peptide sequence, the examiner must submit a request to
                              STIC to perform an interference search of the sequence. If the search results
                              identify any potential interfering subject matter, the examiner will review the
                              application(s) with the potential interfering subject to determine whether
                              interfering subject matter exists. If interfering subject matter does exist, the
                              examiner will follow the guidance set forth in this chapter. If there is no
                              interfering subject matter then the examiner should prepare the application for
                              issuance. A printout of only the database(s) searched, the query(ies) used in the
                              interference search, and the date the interference search was performed must be made
                              of record in the application file. The results of the interference search must
                              <span class="Underline">not</span> be placed in the application
                              file.

                              applications must not be limited to the class or subclass in which the application is
                              classified, but must be extended to all classes, in and out of the Technology Center
                              (TC), in which it has been necessary to search in the examination of the application.
