                        business unit of the Office responsible for their processing. Appeal documents, such as the

                        whether an appeal brief is compliant is not considered a transfer of jurisdiction when an
                        appeal brief is filed, but rather is only a transfer of the specific responsibility of
                        notifying appellant under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356721">37 CFR 41.37(d)</a></b> of the reasons for non-compliance. The Patent
                        Examining Corps retains jurisdiction over the application to consider the appeal brief,
                        conduct an appeal conference, draft an examiner's answer, and decide the entry of
                        amendments, evidence, and information disclosure statements filed after final or after
                        notice of appeal.

                     <p id="ch1200_d1fc3a_161f6_2f3">Therefore, examiners should not identify notices
                        of appeal, appeal briefs or reply briefs as defective or noncompliant for failure to comply
                        with the rules. In the rare situation where a substantial defect in an appeal document is
                        identified after these reviews, the examiner should contact the Patent Appeal Center to
                        determine whether corrective action should be taken.
