                              and any necessary surcharge is being paid on a reissue patent, the payment must
                              identify the reissue patent by reissue patent number and reissue application

                              submitted on as few sheets as possible with the patent numbers listed in
                              increasing patent number order. If the payment submitted is insufficient to
                              cover the maintenance fees and surcharges for all the listed patents, the
                              payment will be applied in the order the patents are listed, beginning at the
                              top of the listing.

                        establishes the guidelines and procedures for submission of maintenance fees, including any
                        necessary surcharges. The patentee may pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges or
                        any person or organization may pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges on behalf
                        of the patentee without filing in the Office evidence of authorization by the patentee to
                        pay maintenance fees. This will enable patentees to pay the maintenance fees and any
                        necessary surcharges themselves or authorize some person or organization to pay maintenance
                        fees and any necessary surcharges on their behalf. No verification of the authority to pay
                        maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges in a particular patent will be made by the
                        Office. While anyone may pay the maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges on a patent,
                        if the payment is accepted by the Office, any Office notices relating to maintenance fees
                        and any necessary surcharges will be mailed to the “fee address” set forth in

                        returned to the person who submitted the payment if a return address is available. It is
                        strongly recommended that the payor should include a return address along with his or her
                        telephone number since the Office may contact the payor in some instances when it is
                        unclear to which patent the fees are to be applied. See <b><a href="s2530.html#d0e248646">MPEP

                        required to be submitted is not that of a prior parent application, but rather the

                        maintenance fees are to be paid. If the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge is
