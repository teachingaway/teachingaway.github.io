                              an electric circuit. In disclosing the invention, Dewey completely described, but did
                              not claim, a “gating means 19” invented by Mathews which was usable in the protective
                              device. Dewey and Mathews were coworkers at General Electric Company, the assignee.
                              Mathews filed his application on March 7, 1963, before the Dewey patent issued but
                              almost 18 months after its filing. The Mathews application disclosed that “one

                              patent application S.N. 138,476-Dewey.” The examiner used Dewey to reject all the

                                    1.132</a></b>. In the affidavit, Dewey stated that he did not invent
                              the gating means 19 but had learned of the gating means through Mathews and that GE
                              attorneys had advised that the gating means be disclosed in Dewey’s application to

                              filing date of the reference. The court reversed the rejection, holding that the
                              totality of the evidence on record showed that Dewey derived his knowledge from
                              Mathews who is “the original, first and sole inventor.”).
