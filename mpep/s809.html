                        presented in the same case are one or more claims (generally called 
                        "linking"
                        
                        
                         claims) which, if allowable, would require

                        link together are usually either all directed to products or all directed to processes
                        (i.e., a product claim linking properly divisible product inventions, or a process claim
                        linking properly divisible process inventions). The most common types of linking claims
                        which, if allowable, act to prevent restriction between inventions that can otherwise be
                        shown to be divisible, are

                        requirement between the linked inventions must be withdrawn. Any claim(s) directed to the
                        nonelected invention(s), previously withdrawn from consideration, which depends from or
                        requires all the limitations of the allowable linking claim must be rejoined and will be
                        fully examined for patentability. Where the requirement for restriction in an application
                        is predicated upon the nonallowability of generic or other type of linking claims,
                        applicant is entitled to retain in the application claims to the nonelected invention or
                        inventions. Where such withdrawn claims have been canceled by applicant pursuant to the
                        restriction requirement, upon the allowance of the linking claim(s), the examiner must
                        notify applicant that any canceled, nonelected claim(s) which depends from or requires all
                        the limitations of the allowable linking claim may be reinstated by submitting the claim(s)
                        in an amendment. Upon entry of the amendment, the amended claim(s) will be fully examined
