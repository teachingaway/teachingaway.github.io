                        granted by a first patent is unjustly extended by the grant of a later issued patent or
                        patents. <i>In re Van Ornum</i>, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761

                        common inventor and/or be either commonly assigned/owned or non-commonly assigned/owned but
                        subject to a joint research agreement as set forth in <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450">35 U.S.C. 103(c)(2)</a></b> and
                        (3) pursuant to the CREATE Act (Pub. L. 108-453, 118 Stat. 3596 (2004)). Congress
                        recognized that the amendment to <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450">35 U.S.C. 103(c)</a></b> would result in
                        situations in which there would be double patenting rejections between applications not
                        owned by the same party (see H.R. Rep. No. 108-425, at 5-6 (2003)). For purposes of a
                        double patenting analysis, the application or patent and the subject matter disqualified
                        under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450">35

                        double patenting seeks to avoid unjustly extending patent rights at the expense of the
                        public, the focus of any double patenting analysis necessarily is on the claims in the
                        multiple patents or patent applications involved in the analysis.

                     <p id="d0e98945">There are generally two types of double
                        patenting rejections. One is the “same invention” type double patenting rejection based on
                        <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35
                              U.S.C. 101</a></b> which states in the singular that an inventor “may obtain
                        a patent.” The second is the “nonstatutory-type” double patenting rejection based on a
                        judicially created doctrine grounded in public policy and which is primarily intended to
                        prevent prolongation of the patent term by prohibiting claims in a second patent not
                        patentably distinguishing from claims in a first patent. Nonstatutory double patenting
                        includes rejections based on either a one-way determination of obviousness or a two-way
                        determination of obviousness. Nonstatutory double patenting could include a rejection which
                        is not the usual “obviousness-type” double patenting rejection. This type of double
                        patenting rejection is rare and is limited to the particular facts of the case. <i>In re Schneller</i>, 397 F.2d 350, 158 USPQ 210 (CCPA
                        1968).

                              assignee/owner. Double patenting may also exist where the inventions claimed in a

                              secured the issuance of a first patent, the examiner must determine whether the grant
                              of a second patent would give rise to an unjustified extension of the rights granted

                              applications became a patent by permitting the examiner to make a “provisional”
                              rejection on the ground of double patenting. <i>In re

                                 Rather, an appropriate terminal disclaimer must be filed in at least two of the

                           A rejection based on double patenting of the “same invention” type finds its support in
                           the language of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b> which states that
                           “whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process ... may obtain a patent
                           therefor ....” Thus, the term “same invention,” in this context, means an invention
                           drawn to identical subject matter. <i>Miller v</i>. <i> Eagle Mfg. Co.</i>, 151 U.S. 186 (1894); <i>In re Vogel</i>, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); and

                           1957). Where the claims of an application are not the “same” as those of a first patent,
                           but the grant of a patent with the claims in the application would unjustly extend the
                           rights granted by the first patent, a double patenting rejection under nonstatutory

                           should not be confused. They are two separate issues. One patent or application
                           “dominates” a second patent or application when the first patent or application has a
                           broad or generic claim which fully encompasses or reads on an invention defined in a
                           narrower or more specific claim in another patent or application. Domination by itself,
                           i.e., in the absence of statutory or nonstatutory double patenting grounds, cannot

                              patenting under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b> is whether a claim
                              in the application could be literally infringed without literally infringing a
                              corresponding claim in the patent. <i>In re Vogel</i>,
                              422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970). Is there an embodiment of the invention that
                              falls within the scope of one claim, but not the other? If there is such an
                              embodiment, then identical subject matter is not defined by both claims and statutory
                              double patenting would not exist. For example, the invention defined by a claim
                              reciting a compound having a “halogen” substituent is not identical to or
                              substantively the same as a claim reciting the same compound except having a
                              “chlorine” substituent in place of the halogen because “halogen” is broader than
                              “chlorine.” On the other hand, claims may be differently worded and still define the
                              same invention. Thus, a claim reciting a widget having a length of “36 inches”
                              defines the same invention as a claim reciting the same widget having a length of “3
                              feet.”

                                 double patenting rejection is appropriate where the conflicting claims are not
                                 identical, but at least one examined application claim is not patentably distinct
                                 from the reference claim(s) because the examined application claim is either
                                 anticipated by, or would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). See,
                                 e.g., <i>In re Berg</i>, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226

                                 whether a nonstatutory basis exists for a double patenting rejection, the first
                                 question to be asked is — does any claim in the application define an invention
                                 that is anticipated by, or is merely an obvious variation of, an invention claimed
                                 in the patent? If the answer is yes, then an “obviousness-type” nonstatutory
                                 double patenting rejection may be appropriate. Obviousness-type double patenting
                                 requires rejection of an application claim when the claimed subject matter is
                                 <b id="d0e99625">not patentably distinct</b> from the subject matter
                                 claimed in a commonly owned patent, or a non-commonly owned patent but subject to
                                 a joint research agreement as set forth in <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450">35 U.S.C.

                                    application had been determined to be patentable] whereby the issuance of the
                                    broader patent was delayed by more than 7 years after the issuance of the
                                    narrower patent. The court determined that the second issued patent was invalid
                                    on the ground of double patenting. Similarly, in <i>In re
                                       Emert</i>, 124 F.3d 1458, 44 USPQ2d 1149 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the court
                                    found that the one-way test is appropriate where applicants, rather than the
                                    Office, had significant control over the rate of prosecution of the application
                                    at issue. In support of its finding that the applicants were responsible for
                                    delaying prosecution of the application during the critical period, the court
                                    noted that the applicants had requested and received numerous time extensions
                                    in various filings. More importantly, the court noted, after initially
                                    receiving an obviousness rejection of all claims, applicants had waited the
                                    maximum period to reply (6 months), then abandoned the application in favor of
                                    a substantially identical continuation application, then received another
                                    obviousness rejection of all claims, again waited the maximum period to reply,
                                    and then again abandoned the application in favor of a second continuation
                                    application substantially identical to the original filing. On the other hand,
                                    in <i>General Foods Corp. v. Studiengesellschaft Kohle
                                       mbH,</i> 972 F.2d 1272, 23 USPQ2d 1839 (Fed. Cir. 1992), the court
                                    elected not to hold the patentee accountable for a delay in issuing the first
                                    filed application until after the second filed application issued as a patent,
                                    even where the patentee had intentionally refiled the first filed application
                                    as a continuation-in-part after receiving a Notice of Allowance indicating that
                                    all claims presented were patentable. Similarly, where, through no fault of the
                                    applicant, the claims in a later filed application issue first, an obvious-type
                                    double patenting rejection is improper, in the absence of a two-way obviousness
                                    determination, because the applicant does not have complete control over the
                                    rate of progress of a patent application through the Office. <i>In re Braat</i>, 937 F.2d 589, 19 USPQ2d 1289 (Fed.
                                    Cir. 1991). While acknowledging that allowance of the claims in the earlier
                                    filed application would result in the timewise extension of an invention
                                    claimed in the patent, the court was of the view that the extension was
                                    justified under the circumstances in this case, indicating that a double
                                    patenting rejection would be proper only if the claimed inventions were obvious
                                    over each other — a two-way obviousness determination.

                                       rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine grounded in public policy (a policy
                                       reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the unjustified or improper timewise extension of
                                       the “right to exclude” granted by a patent and to prevent possible harassment by multiple
                                       assignees. A nonstatutory double patenting rejection is appropriate where the claims at issue
                                       are not identical, but at least one examined application claim is not patentably distinct from
                                       the reference claim(s) because the examined application claim is either anticipated by, or
                                       would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). <i>See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d

                                    The combination ABC was old. He made two improvements on it, (1) adding X and
                                    (2) adding Y, the result still being a unitary clip of enhanced utility. While
                                    his invention can be practiced in the forms ABCX or ABCY, the greatest
                                    advantage and best mode of practicing the invention as disclosed is obtained by
                                    using both inventions in the combination ABCXY. His first application disclosed
                                    ABCXY and other matters. He obtained a patent claiming [a clip comprising] BCX
                                    and ABCX, . . . <i>so</i> claiming these

                                 rule against ‘double patenting,’ however, is not so circumscribed. The fundamental
                                 reason for the rule is to <i>prevent unjustified timewise

                                 that in <i>Schneller</i> was presented to a Federal
                                 Circuit panel in <i>In re Kaplan</i>, 789 F.2d 1574,
                                 229 USPQ 678 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Kaplan had been issued a patent on a process of
                                 making chemicals in the presence of an organic solvent. Among the organic solvents
                                 disclosed and claimed as being useful were tetraglyme and sulfolane. One unclaimed
                                 example in the patent was specifically directed to a mixture of these two
                                 solvents. The claims in the application to Kaplan and Walker, the application
                                 before the Office, were directed to essentially the same chemical process, but
                                 requiring the use of the solvent mixture of tetraglyme and sulfolane. In reversing
                                 the double patenting rejection, the court stated that the mere fact that the broad
                                 process claim of the patent requiring an organic solvent reads on or “dominates”
                                 the narrower claim directed to basically the same process using a specific solvent
                                 mixture does not, <i>per se</i>, justify a double
                                 patenting rejection. The court also pointed out that the double patenting
                                 rejection improperly used the disclosure of the joint invention (solvent mixture)
                                 in the Kaplan patent specification as though it were prior art.

                                 <i>Kaplan</i> case was that the broad invention
                                 was invented by Kaplan, and the narrow invention (i.e., using a specific
                                 combination of solvents) was invented by Kaplan and Walker. Since these
                                 applications (as the applications in <i>Braat</i>)
                                 were filed before the Patent Law Amendments Act of 1984 (Pub. Law 98-622, November
                                 8, 1984) amending <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302886">35 U.S.C. 116</a></b> to expressly
                                 authorize filing a patent application in the names of joint inventors who did not
                                 necessarily make a contribution to the invention defined in each claim in the
                                 patent, it was necessary to file multiple applications to claim both the broad and
                                 narrow inventions. Accordingly, there was a valid reason, driven by statute, why
                                 the claims to the specific solvent mixture were not presented for examination in
                                 the Kaplan patent application.

                                 utility-plant or utility-design situations. Double patenting rejections in

                                 rare in the context of utility versus design patents, a double patenting rejection
                                 of a pending design or utility application can be made on the basis of a
                                 previously issued utility or design patent, respectively. <i>Carman Indus. Inc. v. Wahl</i>, 724 F.2d 932, 220 USPQ
                                 481 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The rejection is based on the public policy preventing the
                                 extension of the term of a patent. Double patenting may be found in a
                                 design-utility situation irrespective of whether the claims in the patent relied
                                 on in the rejection and the claims in issue involve the same invention, or whether
                                 they involve inventions which are obvious variations of one another. <i>In re Thorington</i>, 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA

                              <p id="d0e101008"> In <i>Carman Indus.</i>, the court held that no double patenting existed
                                 between a design and utility patent since the claims in the utility patent, drawn
                                 to the interior construction of a flow promoter, were not directed to the same
                                 invention or an obvious variation of the invention claimed in a design patent
                                 directed to the visible external surface configuration of a storage bin flow
                                 promoter. The majority opinion in this decision appears to indicate that a two-way
                                 obviousness determination is necessary in design-utility cases. 724 F.2d at

                                 previously issued design patent for the same bulb. In another case, a double
