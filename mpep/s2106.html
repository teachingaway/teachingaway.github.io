                              outside of § 101 because it claims an abstract idea.’’). The abstract idea exception

                              some transformative component will in most cases limit the claim to such an
                              application. However, not all such recitations necessarily save the claim: "Flook
                              established that limiting an abstract idea to one field of use or adding token

                              Moreover, the fact that the steps of a claim might occur in the "real world" does not
                              necessarily save it from a <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b> rejection. Thus,
                              the <i>Bilski</i> claims were said to be drawn to an "abstract idea"
                              despite the fact that they included steps drawn to initiating transactions. The

                              determinations during examination of process claims that involve laws of
                              nature/natural correlations, such as the claims in <i>Mayo Collaborative

                              of process claims in which a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or a naturally

                              the claim amounts to significantly more than the natural principle itself. If the
                              claim as a whole satisfies this inquiry, the claim is directed to patent-eligible

                                 and diabetes is a natural principle. A correlation that occurs naturally when a

                                 in principle apart from any human action. These are illustrative examples and are

                                 natural principle must also include additional elements or steps to show that the
                                 inventor has practically applied, or added something significant to, the natural
                                 principle itself. See <i>Mayo,</i> 566 U.S.at __, 132 S.Ct. at 1294,
                                 101 USPQ2d at 1966. To show integration, the additional elements or steps must
                                 relate to the natural principle in a significant way to impose a meaningful limit
                                 on the claim scope. The analysis turns on whether the claim has added enough to
                                 show a practical application. See<i> id.</i> at 1968. In other words,
                                 the claim cannot cover the natural principle itself such that it is effectively
                                 standing alone. A bare statement of a naturally occurring correlation, albeit a

                                 applied in some practical manner. However, there must be at least one additional
                                 element or step that applies, relies on or uses the natural principle so that the
                                 claim amounts to significantly more than the natural principle itself. Elements or

                                 confine its reach to particular patent-eligible applications of those laws, such
                                 as a typical patent on a new drug (including associated method claims) or a new

                                 patent-eligible practical application in <i>Diamond v. Diehr,</i> 450
                                 U.S. 175, 209 USPQ 1 (1981). Recently, the Supreme Court looked back to this claim
                                 as an example of a patent-eligible practical application as explained in the
                                 following excerpt from <i>Mayo</i>:
                              </p>
                              <blockquote id="">The Court pointed out that the basic mathematical equation, like a
                                 law of nature, was not patentable. But it found the overall process patent
                                 eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process integrated the
                                 equation into the process as a whole. Those steps included “installing rubber in a
                                 press, closing the mold, constantly determining the temperature of the mold,
                                 constantly recalculating the appropriate cure time through the use of the formula
                                 and a digital computer, and automatically opening the press at the proper time.” [
                                 ] It nowhere suggested that all these steps, or at least the combination of those
                                 steps, were in context obvious, already in use, or purely conventional. And so the
                                 patentees did not “seek to pre-empt the use of [the] equation,” but sought “only
                                 to foreclose from others the use of that equation in conjunction with all of the
                                 other steps in their claimed process.” [ ] These other steps apparently added to
                                 the formula something that in terms of patent law’s objectives had
                                 significance—they transformed the process into an inventive application of the
                                 formula. <i>Mayo,</i> 566 U.S.at __, 132 S.Ct. at 1298-99, 101 USPQ2d

                                    To put the matter more precisely, do the patent claims add enough to their
                                    statements of the correlations to allow the processes they describe to qualify
                                    as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws? We believe that the

                                    a relevant audience about certain laws of nature; any additional steps consist
                                    of well understood, routine, conventional activity already engaged in by the
                                    scientific community; and those steps, when viewed as a whole, add nothing
                                    significant beyond the sum of their parts taken separately. For these reasons
                                    we believe that the steps are not sufficient to transform unpatentable natural

                                 consequence of the ways in which thiopurine compounds are metabolized by the body.
                                 The Court emphasized that while it takes a human action to trigger a manifestation
                                 of this relation in a particular person, the relation itself exists in principle
                                 apart from any human action. See <i>id. </i> 566 U.S.at __, 132 S.Ct.
                                 at 1297, 101 USPQ2d at 1967. The additional steps integrate the relationship into
                                 the process as the administering step involves the thiopurine drug, the
                                 determining step establishes the thiopurine drug level and the wherein clauses set
                                 forth the critical levels. The steps are not sufficient, however, to narrow the
                                 application such that others could still make use of the naturally occurring
                                 relationship in other practical applications. The claim essentially sets forth a
                                 law of nature with generalized instructions to apply it.
