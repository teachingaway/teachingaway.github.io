                        utility patent can be paid without surcharge. Those periods, referred to generally as the
                        “window period,” are the 6-month periods preceding each due date. The “due dates” are
                        defined in <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e301581">35 U.S.C. 41(b)</a></b>. The window periods are
                        (1) 3 years to 3 1/2 years after the date of issue for the first maintenance fee payment,
                        (2) 7 years to 7 1/2 years after the date of issue for the second maintenance fee payment,

                        paid without surcharge. The last day of a window period is the same day of the month the
                        patent was granted 3 years and 6 months, 7 years and 6 months, or 11 years and 6 months
                        after grant of the patent.

                        utility patent can be paid with surcharge. Those periods, referred to generally as the
                        “grace period,” are the 6-month periods immediately following each due date. The grace
                        periods are (1) 3 1/2 years and through the day of the 4th anniversary of the grant of the
                        patent, (2) 7 1/2 years and through the day of the 8th anniversary of the grant of the

                        the patent. A maintenance fee may be paid with the surcharge on the same date (anniversary
                        date) the patent was granted in the 4th, 8th, or 12th year after grant to prevent the
                        patent from expiring.

                     <p id="d0e248228">Maintenance fees for a reissue patent
                        are due based upon the schedule established for the original utility patent. The filing of
                        a request for <i>ex parte</i> or <i>inter partes</i> reexamination and/or the publication of a reexamination
                        certificate does not alter the schedule of maintenance fee payments of the original
                        patent.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e248237">If the day for paying a maintenance fee
                        falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday within the District of Columbia, the
                        maintenance fee may be paid on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or
                        Federal holiday. For example, if the window period for paying a maintenance fee without a
                        surcharge ended on a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday within the District of
                        Columbia, the maintenance fee can be paid without surcharge on the next succeeding day that
                        is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday within the District of Columbia. Likewise,
                        if the grace period for paying a maintenance fee with a surcharge ended on a Saturday,
                        Sunday, or a Federal holiday within the District of Columbia, the maintenance fee can be
                        paid with surcharge on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal
                        holiday within the District of Columbia. In the latter situation, the failure to pay the
                        maintenance fee and surcharge on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or
                        a Federal holiday within the District of Columbia will result in the patent expiring on a
                        date (4, 8, or 12 years after the date of grant) earlier than the last date on which the
                        maintenance fee and surcharge could be paid. This situation results from the provisions of
                        <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e301434">35 U.S.C. 21</a></b>, but those provisions do not extend the expiration date
                        of the patent if the maintenance fee and any required surcharge are not paid when required.
                        For example, if the grace period for paying a maintenance fee with a surcharge ended on a
                        Saturday, the maintenance fee and surcharge could be paid on the next succeeding business
                        day, e.g., Monday, but the patent will have expired at midnight on Saturday if the
                        maintenance fee and surcharge were not paid on the following Monday. Therefore, if the
                        maintenance fee and any applicable surcharge are not paid, the patent will expire as of the
                        end of the grace period as listed above. A patent that expires for failure of payment will
                        expire on the anniversary date the patent was granted in the 4th, 8th, or 12th year after
                        the grant.
