                                 by the examiner in the application. Applicants are strongly discouraged from
                                 submitting a list that includes copies of PTO/SB/08 or PTO-892 forms from other
                                 applications. A completed PTO/SB/08 form from another application may already have
                                 initials of an examiner and the application number of another application. This
                                 information will likely confuse the record. Furthermore, when the spaces provided
                                 on the form have initials of an examiner, there are no spaces available next to
                                 the documents listed for the examiner of the subsequent application to provide his
                                 or her initials, and the previously relevant initials may be erroneously construed
                                 as being applied for the current application.

                                 number), and the filing date. If a U.S. application being listed in an IDS has

                                 published application. Each publication must be identified by publisher, author
                                 (if any), title, relevant pages of the publication, and date and place of
                                 publication. The date of publication supplied must include at least the month and
                                 year of publication, except that the year of publication (without the month) will
                                 be accepted if the applicant points out in the information disclosure statement

                           version 5.1 released on April 14, 2003, permits applicants and registered practitioners
                           to sign portions of an EFS submission with an electronic signature. The electronic
                           signature is any typed combination of alphanumeric characters. The electronic signature
                           must comply with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313174">37 CFR 1.4(d)(3)</a></b>. The electronic
                           signature may be on EFS transmittal letters, declarations, powers of attorney, fee
                           sheets, and later filed biosequence listings. Accordingly, an e-IDS should not be denied
                           consideration solely because it has an alpha numeric electronic signature if filed on or
                           after April 14, 2003. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e55351">If the e-IDS transmittal letter and
                           list of references is missing from an application file, an examiner may request that the
                           technical support staff obtain an additional printed copy of the letter and reference
                           list from the Office of Patent Application Processing (OPAP).

                        <p id="d0e55363">As of January 18, 2006, the Office
                           began electronic processing of the list of citations (e.g., form PTO/SB/08) submitted as
                           part of an information disclosure statement (IDS) submitted in applications stored by
                           the Office in image form. Examiners are provided with a tool on their desktop
                           (Annotation Tool deployed as part of eDAN 2.0) to electronically annotate citations and
                           electronically sign the IDS when reviewing the cited references. The electronically
                           processed IDS will be stored in the Office’s official record as an entry in the
                           application’s image file wrapper (IFW) and a copy will be mailed to applicant as part of
                           an Office action. Applicants that receive numerous Office actions may receive some IDS
                           annotated by hand while receiving other IDSs annotated by electronic means for a limited
                           time period.

                           <p id="d0e55370">The electronic annotation, similar
                              to hand written annotations, will cause the initials of the reviewing examiner to be
                              applied to either: (A) the immediate left of each citation reviewed; or (B) the
                              immediate left of the first of several consecutive citations and the left of the last
                              of the consecutive citations reviewed with a line connecting the initials. Citations
                              that have not been considered will be lined through.

                           <p id="d0e55373">The electronic signature will be
                              in the form /John Q. Examiner/ at the bottom of the last sheet of citations of an
                              IDS. The examiner may elect to electronically sign each sheet of citations
                              considered.

                           <p id="d0e55376">As of October 1, 2007, examiners
                              may use an alternative electronic signature method for IDS. Under the alternative
                              electronic signature, examiners will no longer initial each reference citation
                              considered, but will continue to strikethrough each citation not considered. Each
                              page of reference citations will be stamped by the examiner with the phrase “All
                              references considered except where lined through” along with the examiner’s
                              electronic initials, and the final page of reference citations will include the
                              examiner’s electronic signature.
