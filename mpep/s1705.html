                           an action on the merits. The examiner indicates the type of second action on the
                           Examiner’s Case Action Worksheet, and the PALM system will automatically determine if it
                           is a FAOM. If the second action is a FAOM, the action will be listed and credited on the
                           Biweekly Examiner Time and Activity Report as a Second/Subsequent FAOM.
