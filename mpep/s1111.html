                        subject matter claimed in a statutory invention registration takes effect on publication
                        <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e325811">pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.293(c)</a></b>) and may affect the patentability of claims
                        in related applications without SIR requests, such as divisional or other continuing
                        applications, since the waiver of patent rights is effective for all inventions claimed in
                        the SIR and would effectively waive the right of the inventor to obtain a patent on the
                        invention claimed in the same application or on the same invention claimed in any other
                        application not issued before the publication date of the SIR. If an application containing
                        generic claims is published as a SIR, the waiver in that application applies to any other
                        related applications to the extent that the same invention claimed in the SIR is claimed in
                        the other application. Examiners should apply standards similar to those applied in making
                        “same invention” double patenting determinations to determine whether a waiver by an
                        inventor to claims in a SIR precludes patenting by the same inventor to subject matter in
                        any related application. If the same subject matter is claimed in an application and in a
                        published statutory invention registration naming a common inventor, the claims in the
                        application should be rejected as being precluded by the waiver in the statutory invention
                        registration. A rejection as being precluded by a waiver in a SIR cannot be overcome by a
                        terminal disclaimer.

                        file a reissue application to recapture the rights, including the right to exclude others
                        from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing the invention, that were waived
                        by the initial publication of the SIR.
