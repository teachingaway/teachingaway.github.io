                                 the test for the public use prong includes the consideration of evidence relevant

                                       the court in Bernhardt noted that an exhibition display at issue in the case
                                       “was not open to the public, that the identification of attendees was
                                       checked against a list of authorized names by building security and later at
                                       a reception desk near the showroom, that attendees were escorted through the

                                       take photographs inside the showroom.” <i>Id.</i> The court remanded the issue of whether the exhibition
                                       display was a public use for further proceedings since the district court
                                       “focused on the absence of any confidentiality agreements and did not
                                       discuss or analyze how the totality of the circumstances surrounding” the

                                    claimed invention has occurred, a key question to ask is whether the inventor
                                    sold or offered for sale a product that embodies the invention claimed in the
                                    application. Objective evidence such as a description of the inventive product
                                    in the contract of sale or in another communication with the purchaser controls
                                    over an uncommunicated intent by the seller to deliver the inventive product
                                    under the contract for sale. <i>Ferag AG v. Quipp,

                                    for sale neither clearly specified nor precluded use of the inventive design,
                                    but an order confirmation prior to the critical date did specify use of
                                    inventive design.). The purchaser need not have actual knowledge of the
                                    invention for it to be on sale. The determination of whether “the offered
                                    product is in fact the claimed invention may be established by any relevant
                                    evidence, such as memoranda, drawings, correspondence, and testimony of
