                        stated that “[t]he statute does not prohibit divisional or continuation reissue
                        applications, and does not place stricter limitations on such applications when they are
                        presented by reissue, provided of course that the statutory requirements specific to
                        reissue applications are met.” Following the decision in <i>Graff</i>, the Office has adopted a policy of treating continuations and
                        divisionals of reissue applications, to the extent possible, in the same manner as
                        continuations and divisionals of non-reissue applications.

                     <p id="d0e142816">Nonetheless, the mere fact that the
                        application purports to be a continuation or divisional of a parent reissue application
                        does not make it a reissue application itself, since it is possible to file a

                              U.S.C. 111(a)</a></b> continuing application of a reissue application. See
                        <i>In re Bauman</i>, 683 F.2d 405, 409, 214 USPQ 585, 589
                        (CCPA 1982) (a patentee may file a regular continuation of a reissue application that
                        obtains the benefit of the reissue application's filing date). There must be an
                        identification, on filing, that the application is a continuation reissue application, as
                        opposed to a continuation of a reissue application (i.e., a <i>Bauman</i> type continuation application). Likewise, there must be an
                        identification, on filing, that the application is a divisional reissue application, as
                        opposed to a divisional of a reissue application. Thus, the specification must be amended
                        to state that the application is a 
                        "continuation
                        reissue application"
                        
                        
                         or 
                        "divisional reissue application"
                        
                        
                         of its parent reissue application.
                        If the specification is amended to state that the application is a 
                        "continuation"
                        
                        
                         or 
                        "divisional"
                        
                        
                         of its parent reissue application, the
                        application may very well be treated as a <i>Bauman </i>type
                        continuation or divisional application. In general, an application which is a continuing
                        application of a reissue application will be a Bauman application where there are no
                        indicia that a continuing reissue application is being filed. Indicia that a continuing
                        reissue application is being filed are:
