                        Entitlement to Priority [R-11.2013]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="ch200_d1ff72_271ce_3d3">When the claim to priority and the certified copy
                        of the foreign application are received while the application is pending before the
                        examiner, the examiner generally makes no examination of the papers except to see that they
                        contain no obvious formal defects and correspond in number, date and country to the
                        application identified in the application data sheet for an application filed on or after
                        September 16, 2012, or oath or declaration for an application filed prior to September 16,
                        2012. In addition, for original applications filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) (other than
                        design applications), the examiner should make sure that the claim for foreign priority is
                        timely. Examiners may use form paragraph 2.21.01 to notify applicant that the foreign
                        priority claim is untimely. See also MPEP § 214.03.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch200_d1ff72_271e1_95">The subject matter of the application is not
                        examined to determine whether the applicant is actually entitled to the benefit of the
                        foreign filing date on the basis of the disclosure thereof. The only times during
                        <i>ex parte</i> prosecution that the examiner considers the merits of an
                        applicant’s claim of priority is when a reference is found with an effective date between
                        the date of the foreign filing and the date of filing in the United States and when an
                        interference situation is under consideration. If at the time of making an action the
                        examiner has found such an intervening reference, he or she simply rejects whatever claims
                        may be considered unpatentable thereover, without paying any attention to the priority date
                        (assuming the certified copy of the priority papers has not yet been filed). The applicant
                        in his or her reply may argue the rejection if it is of such a nature that it can be
                        argued, or present the foreign papers for the purpose of overcoming the date of the
                        reference. If the applicant argues the reference, the examiner, in the next action in the
                        application, may specifically require the foreign papers to be filed in addition to
                        repeating the rejection if it is still considered applicable, or he or she may merely
                        continue the rejection.

                     <p id="ch200_d1ff72_27d47_1ab">In those cases where the applicant files the
                        certified copy of the foreign application for the purpose of overcoming the effective date
                        of a reference, a translation is required if the certified copy is not in the English
                        language. When the examiner requires the filing of the certified copy, the translation
                        should also be required at the same time. This translation must be filed together with a
                        statement that the translation of the certified copy is accurate. When the necessary
                        certified copy and translation are filed to overcome the date of the reference, the
                        examiner’s action, if he or she determines that the applicant is not entitled to the
                        priority date, is to repeat the rejection on the reference, stating the reasons why the
                        applicant is not considered entitled to the date. If it is determined that the applicant is
                        entitled to the date, the rejection is withdrawn in view of the priority
                        date.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch200_d1ff72_27d4f_335">If the certified copy, and translation if
                        necessary, is already in the file when the examiner finds a reference with the intervening
                        effective date, the examiner will study the certified copy, if it is in the English
                        language, to determine if the applicant is entitled to the priority date. If the applicant
                        is found to be entitled to the priority date, the reference is not relied upon as prior
                        art, but may be cited to applicant on form PTO-892. If the applicant is found not entitled
                        to the date, the unpatentable claims are rejected on the reference with an explanation. If
                        the certified copy is not in the English language and there is no translation, the examiner
                        may reject the unpatentable claims and at the same time require an English translation for
                        the purpose of determining the applicant’s right to rely on the foreign filing
                        date.

                     <p id="ch200_d1ff72_27d85_37d">The foreign application may have been filed by
                        and in the name of the assignee or legal representative or agent of the inventor, as
                        applicant. In such cases, if the certified copy of the foreign application corresponds with
                        the one identified in the oath or declaration as required by 37 CFR 1.63 (for an
                        application filed prior to September 16, 2012) or an application data sheet and no
                        discrepancies appear, it may be assumed that the inventors are entitled to the claim for
                        priority. If there is disagreement as to inventors on the certified copy, the priority date
                        should be refused until the inconsistency or disagreement is resolved.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch200_d1ff72_27d8f_1be">The most important aspect of the examiner’s
                        action pertaining to a right of priority is the determination of the identity of invention
                        between the U.S. and the foreign applications. The foreign application may be considered in
                        the same manner as if it had been filed in this country on the same date that it was filed
                        in the foreign country, and the applicant is ordinarily entitled to any claims based on
                        such foreign application that he or she would be entitled to under our laws and practice.
                        The foreign application must be examined for the question of sufficiency of the disclosure
                        under 35 U.S.C. 112, as well as to determine if there is a basis for the claims
                        sought.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch200_d1ff72_27d9a_23e">In applications filed from the United Kingdom
                        there may be submitted a certified copy of the “provisional specification,” which may also
                        in some cases be accompanied by a copy of the “complete specification.” The nature and
                        function of the United Kingdom provisional specification is described in an article in the
                        Journal of the Patent Office Society of November 1936, pages 770-774. According to United
                        Kingdom law the provisional specification need not contain a complete disclosure of the
                        invention in the sense of 35 U.S.C. 112, but need only describe the general nature of the
                        invention, and neither claims nor drawings are required. Consequently, in considering such
                        provisional specifications, the question of completeness of disclosure is important. If it
                        is found that the United Kingdom provisional specification is insufficient for lack of
                        disclosure, reliance may then be had on the complete specification and its date, if one has
                        been presented, the complete specification then being treated as a different application
                        and disregarded as to the requirement to file within 1 year. In some instances, the
                        specification and drawing of the foreign application may have been filed at a date
                        subsequent to the filing of the petition in the foreign country. Even though the petition
                        is called the application and the filing date of this petition is the filing date of the
                        application in a particular country, the date accorded here is the date on which the
                        specification and drawing were filed.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch200_d1ff72_27dad_13a">It may occasionally happen that the U.S.
                        application will be found entitled to the filing date of the foreign application with
                        respect to some claims and not with respect to others. Occasionally an applicant may rely
                        on two or more different foreign applications and may be entitled to the filing date of one
                        of them with respect to certain claims and to another with respect to other claims.

                           under 35 U.S.C. 255 and 37 CFR 1.323. See 37 CFR 1.55. As another example, in

                           had not been filed in the application prior to issuance of the patent. However, the
                           application was a continuation of an earlier application in which the requirements of 35
                           U.S.C. 119(a)-(d) or (f) had been satisfied. Accordingly, the Commissioner held that the
                           “applicants’ perfection of a priority claim under 35 U.S.C. 119 in the parent
                           application will satisfy the statute with respect to their continuation application.” 
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch200_d1ff72_27f87_20a">Although <i>In re Van Esdonk</i>
                           involved the patent of a continuation application filed under former 37 CFR 1.60, it is
                           proper to apply the holding of that case in similar factual circumstances to any
                           patented application having benefits under 35 U.S.C. 120. This is primarily because a
                           claim to foreign priority benefits in a continuing application, where the claim has been
                           perfected in the parent application, constitutes in essence a mere affirmation of the
                           applicant’s previously expressed desire to receive benefits under 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d)
                           or (f) for subject matter common to the foreign, parent, and continuing
                           applications.
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch200_d1ff72_27f96_15">In summary, a certificate of correction under
                           35 U.S.C. 255 and 37 CFR 1.323 may be requested and issued in order to perfect a claim
                           for foreign priority benefit in a patented application if the requirements of 35 U.S.C.
                           119(a)-(d) or (f) had been satisfied in the patented application or in a parent
                           application prior to issuance of the patent and the requirements of 37 CFR 1.55 are met.
                           If the continuing application which issued as a patent is other than a design
                           application, in addition to the filing of a certificate of correction request, patentee
                           must also file a petition for an unintentionally delayed foreign priority claim under 37
                           CFR 1.55 along with the surcharge as set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(t) when necessary.
                           However, a claim to foreign priority benefits cannot be perfected via a certificate of
                           correction if the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d) or (f) had not been satisfied in
                           the patented application, or its parent, prior to issuance and the requirements of 37
                           CFR 1.55 are not met. In this latter circumstance, the claim to foreign priority
                           benefits can be perfected only by way of a reissue application in accordance with the
                           rationale set forth in <i>Brenner v. State of Israel</i>, 158 USPQ
                           584.
