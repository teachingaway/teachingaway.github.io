                              answer on appeal, unless an answer is designated as containing a new ground of

                                             different portion of that reference for some claim limitations, and
                                             asserted that the remaining claim limitations were inherently present

                                             The Board affirmed the rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103 over the same

                                             545 F.3d at 1381. Importantly, the Board cited the Example for the
                                             same two claim limitations taught in the abstract, and the Example
                                             merely elaborated upon the medicinal qualities of the mangosteen rind
                                             (which medicinal qualities were not claimed) and taught orange juice
                                             as the preferred fruit juice (while the claim merely recited fruit or
                                             vegetable juice). Hence, the Example merely provided a more specific
                                             disclosure of the same two generic limitations that were fully taught
                                             by the abstract. The court held that this did not constitute a new

                                             single reference. The applicant submitted three additional references
                                             as evidence that the prior art teaches away from performing
                                             sulfonation above 127° C, citing portions of those references which
                                             taught lower temperature reactions. The Board affirmed the rejection,
                                             finding the applicant’s evidence unpersuasive. On appeal, the
