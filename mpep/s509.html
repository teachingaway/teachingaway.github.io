                              the processing of international applications (§&nbsp;<b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e328174">1.445</a></b>), shall be made in U.S. dollars and in the form of

                              must be made payable to the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark
                              Office. (Checks made payable to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks will
                              continue to be accepted.) Payments from foreign countries must be payable and

                              card, except for replenishing a deposit account. Payment of a fee by credit
                              card must specify the amount to be charged to the credit card and such other
                              information as is necessary to process the charge, and is subject to collection
                              of the fee. The Office will not accept a general authorization to charge fees
                              to a credit card. If credit card information is provided on a form or document

                              card, the Office will not be liable if the credit card number becomes public
                              knowledge.

                              the payment of a fee, such as when a party desires to withdraw a patent filing
                              for which the fee was paid, including an application, an appeal, or a request
                              for an oral hearing, will not entitle a party to a refund of such fee. The
                              Office will not refund amounts of twenty-five dollars or less unless a refund
                              is specifically requested, and will not notify the payor of such amounts. If a
                              party paying a fee or requesting a refund does not provide the banking
                              information necessary for making refunds by electronic funds transfer (31
                              U.S.C. 3332 and 31 CFR part 208), or instruct the Office that refunds are to be
                              credited to a deposit account, the Director may require such information, or
                              use the banking information on the payment instrument to make a refund. Any
                              refund of a fee paid by credit card will be by a credit to the credit card
                              account to which the fee was charged.

                           fees are paid. The Office may return fees that are not itemized. The intent of the fee
                           itemization requirement is to encourage a better explanation by applicants of how fees
                           being paid are to be applied by the Office. This will allow Office employees to properly
                           account for the fees being paid by applicants. It should be noted that the language of

                           types of claims. Further, in a paper submitted on a date later than the actual filing
                           date, the reference to “filing fee(s)” would also be sufficient to cover the surcharge

                              and the loan may be secured with rights in a patent application or patent of the
                              applicant or patentee, respectively. The granting of such a security interest to the
                              banking institution is not a currently enforceable obligation to assign, grant,
                              convey, or license any rights in the invention to the banking institution. Only if
                              the loan is defaulted upon will the security interest permit a transfer of rights in
                              the application or patent to the banking institution. Thus, where the banking
                              institution is a large entity, the applicant or patentee would not be prohibited from
                              claiming small entity status merely because the banking institution has been granted
                              a security interest, but if the loan is defaulted upon, there would be a loss of
                              entitlement to small entity status. Pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316949">37 CFR 1.27(g)</a></b>,

                                 applicant (37 CFR 1.42 or 1.421); (2) a patent practitioner of record or acting in
                                 a representative capacity under 37 CFR 1.34; (3) the inventor or a joint inventor,
                                 if the inventor is the applicant; or (4) the assignee. See 37 CFR 1.27(c)(2). The
                                 change to 37 CFR 1.27 for applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, is
                                 for consistency with the change in practice concerning who is the applicant for
                                 patent in 37 CFR 1.42. The applicant as defined in 37 CFR 1.42 (or 37 CFR 1.421)
                                 can sign a written assertion of small entity status. Thus, the assignee, the
                                 person to whom the inventor is under an obligation to assign the invention, or the
                                 person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter, who is
                                 applying for a patent under 37 CFR 1.46 can sign the written assertion of small
                                 entity status. In addition, if there are joint inventors who are the applicant,
                                 then one of the joint inventors can sign a written assertion of small entity
                                 status and thereby establish small entity status for the application (but see
                                 paragraph VI. below). The assignee can sign a written assertion of small entity
                                 status even if the assignee is not the applicant or is a juristic
                                 entity.

                              Patent and Trademark Office rely exclusively on a self-certification that a patent
                              applicant qualifies as an independent inventor (now person), small business concern,
                              or nonprofit organization. In addition, it was also stated during Congressional
                              consideration of the legislation that no additional resources would be required to
                              administer the system whereby fees would be reduced for small
                              entities.

                              the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to give advisory opinions as to entitlement to
                              small entity status. Accordingly, any individual seeking to establish status as a
                              small entity for purposes of paying the fee in an application or patent must file the
                              assertion required by <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316949">37 CFR 1.27</a></b> and in so doing is

                           </h2>
                           <p id="ch500_d1ff65_1fe46_12e">35 U.S.C. 123 requires a certification as a
                              condition for an applicant to be considered a micro entity. The certification must be
                              in writing and must be filed prior to or at the time a fee is first paid in the micro
                              entity amount in an application or patent. Status as a micro entity in one
                              application or patent does not affect the status of any other application or patent.
                              The refiling of an application under 37 CFR 1.53 as a continuation or divisional, or
                              continuation-in-part application (including a continued prosecution application under
                              37 CFR 1.53(d) (design applications only)), or the filing of a reissue application,
                              requires a new certification of entitlement to micro entity status in the continuing
                              or reissue application. See 37 CFR 1.29(e). A fee may be paid in the micro entity
                              amount only if it is submitted with, or subsequent to, the submission of a
                              certification of entitlement to micro entity status. See 37 CFR 1.29(f). The micro
                              entity provisions of 37 CFR 1.29 apply to applications filed before, on, and after
                              March 19, 2013. A micro entity certification may be filed in pending applications,
                              reexamination proceedings, and supplemental examination proceedings at any time
                              during prosecution and in patents prior to or concurrent with a maintenance fee
                              payment.

                           <p id="ch500_d1ff65_1fe90_2a9">There are two separate bases for
                              establishing micro entity status referred to as the “gross income basis” under 35
                              U.S.C. 123(a) and the “institution of higher education basis” under 35 U.S.C. 123(d).
                              37 CFR 1.29(a) implements the gross income basis for establishing micro entity
                              status, and 37 CFR 1.29(d) implements the institution of higher education basis for
                              establishing micro entity status. The Office’s micro entity certification forms are
                              form PTO/SB/15A (gross income basis)(see MPEP § 509.04(a)) and form PTO/SB/15B
                              (institution of higher education basis)(see MPEP § 509.04(b)). No evidence such as a
                              copy of a tax return need accompany the certification form(s). In addition, the
                              certification form(s) need not be notarized. The certification form(s) must, however,
                              identify the application or patent to which it pertains and it must be signed by an
                              authorized party as set forth in MPEP § 509.04(c). For new application filings not
                              previously assigned a patent application number, providing the first named inventor
                              and the title of the invention at the top of the certification form(s) in the spaces
                              provided will be sufficient to identify the application. It is strongly recommended
                              that the following document descriptions in EFS-Web be used as
                              appropriate:

                              Under 37 CFR 1.29(a)(4), the gross income limit applies to each party with an

                                 inventors need not be below the income level in 35 U.S.C. 123(a)(3)). Further, the
                                 assignment requirement in 37 CFR 1.29(a)(4) applies to each applicant and inventor

                                 to more than one assignee (e.g., half interest in the invention to two assignees),
                                 each of the assignees must meet the income limit specified in 37 CFR 1.29(a)(4)).

                                 assigns some rights to another small entity. Similarly, to obtain micro entity
                                 status, 37 CFR 1.29(h) requires that any non-applicant assignee be a small

                                    available for the first time on March 19, 2013.) However if the third-filed

                                    requirements under 37 CFR 1.29(a) are met. If the fourth and fifth filed

                                 <p id="ch500_d1ff69_23123_a4">It should be noted that “gross income”
                                    means total income. “Gross income” and “adjusted gross income” are not the same
                                    thing. Adjusted gross income is defined as gross income minus adjustments to
                                    income. For purposes of micro entity status it is “gross income” – not
                                    “adjusted gross income” that matters. Section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue
                                    Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 61(a)) provides that: "[e]xcept as otherwise provided
                                    in this subtitle, gross income means all income from whatever source derived,
                                    including (but not limited to) the following items: (1) Compensation for
                                    services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items; (2)
                                    Gross income derived from business; (3) Gains derived from dealings in
                                    property; (4) Interest; (5) Rents; (6) Royalties; (7) Dividends; (8) Alimony
                                    and separate maintenance payments; (9) Annuities; (10) Income from life
                                    insurance and endowment contracts; (11) Pensions; (12) Income from discharge of
                                    indebtedness; (13) Distributive share of partnership gross income; (14) Income
                                    in respect of a decedent; and (15) Income from an interest in an estate or
                                    trust."

                                    “preceding calendar year” advances, and anyone’s preceding calendar year’s
                                    gross income may change as a result. Therefore, if the prosecution of an
                                    application under micro entity status extends across multiple calendar years,
                                    each applicant, inventor, and joint inventor must verify that the gross income
                                    limit for the requisite calendar year is met to maintain eligibility for the
                                    micro entity discount. If the gross income limit is no longer met, then a
                                    notification of loss of entitlement to micro entity status must be filed in the
                                    application to remove micro entity status. On the other hand, it is possible a
                                    small entity applicant not meeting the gross income limits specified in 37 CFR
                                    1.29(a)(3) and (4) in the calendar year in which the application was filed
                                    could meet the 37 CFR 1.29(a)(3) and (4) gross income limits in the calendar
                                    year in which the issue fee is paid, for example, due to a reduction in income.
                                    However, the applicant must still be a small entity at the time of issue fee
                                    payment, and the applicant must have met the application filing limit under 37
                                    CFR 1.29(a)(2) when the application was filed.

                                    applies to the amount of income the person would have reported as gross income

                                    inventors, gross income from the deceased inventor’s estate or trust does not
                                    count toward the gross income limit because the trust or decedent’s estate is
                                    considered a separate legal entity. However, the deceased inventor’s legal
                                    representative acting on behalf of the deceased inventor under 37 CFR 1.43 is
                                    an “applicant” in terms of 37 CFR 1.29(a). Therefore the legal representative’s
                                    gross income in the preceding calendar year cannot exceed the gross income
                                    limit under 37 CFR 1.29(a)(3) in order to qualify for micro entity status. For
                                    example, if the deceased inventor has a surviving spouse who is named on the
                                    Application Data Sheet (ADS) as an applicant by virtue of being the legal
                                    representative of the deceased inventor, the surviving spouse’s gross income in
                                    the preceding calendar year cannot exceed the gross income limit in order to
                                    qualify for micro entity status. On the other hand, if the deceased inventor
                                    had assigned all rights in the application (or if subsequent to the inventor’s
                                    death, the legal representative assigned all rights in the application) AND the
                                    assignee that received all rights was named as an applicant (or the applicant),
                                    then it would be the assignee that would have to meet the gross income limit
                                    (under 37 CFR 1.29(a)(4)) and not the legal representative. In any event, each
                                    other joint inventor, assignee, and licensee (if any) would also have to meet
                                    the gross income limit in order to qualify for micro entity
                                    status.

                                 <p id="ch500_d1ff69_231bd_1e3">Pursuant to 37 CFR 1.29(a)(4), the
                                    gross income limit extends to any party with an “ownership interest” from any
                                    applicant or inventor. Accordingly, for each inventor, applicant, and party
                                    with an “ownership interest,” gross income in the calendar year preceding the
                                    time of fee payment must not exceed the “maximum qualifying gross income.”
                                    Thus, the gross income limit applies to the assignee regardless of whether the
                                    assignee is identified as the applicant. For micro entity status, 37 CFR
                                    1.29(a)(4) requires that the gross income limit be met by each assignee and
                                    licensee (if any) as well as by each inventor.

                                    interest in the patent application to an entity that exceeds the gross income
                                    limit. For example, consider a patent application with a sole inventor who does
                                    not exceed the gross income limit. If the inventor assigns, or is obligated to
                                    assign, all rights in the patent application to an employer that is, for
                                    example, a corporation having several million dollars in annual receipts, there
                                    can be no micro entity discount of patent fees. Depending on the size of the
                                    corporation, the small entity discount may be unavailable as well. If the
                                    corporation transfers all of its rights back to the inventor, or transfers all
                                    of its rights to some other person who does not exceed the gross income limit,
                                    such a retransfer will not result in qualification for micro entity status. The
                                    37 CFR 1.29(a)(4) certification requirement is that no ownership interest "has"
                                    been transferred, or is obligated to be transferred, to an assignee or licensee
                                    that exceeds the gross income limit. Once an assignee or licensee exceeding the
                                    gross income limit receives the ownership interest, the 37 CFR 1.29(a)(4)
                                    certification requirement can no longer be met – even if the assignee or

                                    Act of 1965 is that the institution be non-profit. Therefore, for-profit
                                    universities and colleges do not qualify as an “institution of higher

                                    stated, foreign universities do not qualify as an “institution of higher
                                    education” for purposes of establishing micro entity status. A foreign
                                    university may offer an on-line educational program in the United States,
                                    however, on-line classes offered in the United States would not qualify the

                                    “in any State” in the context of what “in any State” meant in 1965 – the year
                                    of the Higher Education Act of 1965. In addition, institutions that only grant
                                    graduate degrees do not qualify as an “institution of higher education” for
                                    purposes of establishing micro entity status because section 101(a) of the
                                    Higher Education Act of 1965 is limited to an institution that “provides an

                                    1.33(b). Payment of a fee in other than the micro entity amount is not

                                    appropriate will not be treated as a notification that small entity

                           <p id="ch500_d1ff69_27701_1c4">37 CFR 1.29(k) contains provisions for a
                              micro entity that correspond to the provisions of 37 CFR 1.28(c) for a small entity.
                              37 CFR 1.28(c) permits an applicant or patentee to correct the erroneous payment of a
                              patent fee in the small entity amount if status as a small entity was established in
                              good faith, and fees as a small entity were paid in good faith. See <i>DH Tech.
                                 Inc. v. Synergystex Int’l Inc.,</i> 154 F.3d 1333 (Fed. Cir. 1998). 37 CFR
                              1.29(k) provides that if: (i) An applicant or patentee establishes micro entity
                              status in an application or patent in good faith; (ii) the applicant or patentee pays
                              fees as a micro entity in the application or patent in good faith; and (iii)
                              applicant or patentee later discovers that such micro entity status either was
                              established in error, or that the Office was not notified of a loss of entitlement to
                              micro entity status as required by 37 CFR 1.29(i) through error, the error will be
                              excused upon compliance with the separate submission and itemization requirements of
                              37 CFR 1.29(k)(1) and the deficiency payment requirement of 37 CFR
                              1.29(k)(2).

                           <p id="ch500_d1ff69_27714_2ed">37 CFR 1.29(k)(1) provides that any paper
                              submitted under 37 CFR 1.29(k) must be limited to the deficiency payment (all fees
                              paid in error) required for a single application or patent. 37 CFR 1.29(k)(1)
                              provides that where more than one application or patent is involved, separate
                              submissions of deficiency payments (e.g., checks) and itemizations are required for
                              each application or patent. 37 CFR 1.29(k)(1) also provides that the paper must
                              contain an itemization of the total deficiency payment and include the following
                              information: (1) Each particular type of fee that was erroneously paid as a micro
                              entity, (e.g., basic statutory filing fee, two-month extension of time fee) along
                              with the current fee amount for a small or non-small entity; (2) the micro entity fee
                              actually paid, and the date on which it was paid; (3) the deficiency owed amount (for
                              each fee erroneously paid); and (4) the total deficiency payment owed, which is the
                              sum or total of the individual deficiency owed amounts as set forth in 37 CFR
                              1.29(k)(2).

                              deficiency owed, resulting from the previous erroneous payment of micro entity fees,
                              must be paid. The deficiency owed for each previous fee erroneously paid as a micro
                              entity is the difference between the current fee amount for a small entity or
                              non-small entity, as applicable, on the date the deficiency is paid in full and the
                              amount of the previous erroneous micro entity fee payment. The total deficiency
                              payment owed is the sum of the individual deficiency owed amounts for each fee amount
                              previously and erroneously paid as a micro entity. This corresponds to the procedure
                              for fee deficiency payments based upon the previous erroneous payment of patent fees
                              in the small entity amount. See 37 CFR 1.28(c)(2)(i) ("[t]he deficiency owed for each
                              previous fee erroneously paid as a small entity is the difference between the current
                              full fee amount (for non-small entity) on the date the deficiency is paid in full and
                              the amount of the previous erroneous (small entity) fee payment").

                              either be treated at the option of the Office as an authorization for the Office to
