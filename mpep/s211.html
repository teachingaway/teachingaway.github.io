                                 claiming the benefit of a prior-filed nonprovisional application under 35 U.S.C.
                                 120, 121, or 365(c), the later-filed application must be copending with the prior
                                 application or with an intermediate nonprovisional application similarly entitled
                                 to the benefit of the filing date of the prior application. Copendency is defined
                                 in the clause which requires that the later-filed application must be filed
                                 before: (A) the patenting of the prior application; (B) the abandonment of the
                                 prior application; or (C) the termination of proceedings in the prior application.
                                 If the prior application issues as a patent, it is sufficient for the later-filed
                                 application to be copending with it if the later-filed application is filed on the
                                 same date, or before the date that the patent issues on the prior application.
                                 Thus, the later-filed application may be filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b) while the
                                 prior application is still pending before the examiner, or is in issue, or even
                                 between the time the issue fee is paid and the patent issues. Patents usually will
                                 be published within four weeks of payment of the issue fee. Applicants are
                                 encouraged to file any continuing applications no later than the date the issue
                                 fee is paid, to avoid issuance of the prior application before the continuing
                                 application is filed.

                                 abandonment for failure to prosecute (MPEP § 711.02), express abandonment (MPEP §
                                 711.01), abandonment for failure to pay the issue fee (37 CFR 1.316), and

                                 nonpublication request under 35 U.S.C. 122(b)(2)(B)(iii) (MPEP § 1124). The
                                 expression “termination of proceedings” includes the situations when an
                                 application is abandoned or when a patent has been issued, and hence this
                                 expression is the broadest of the three copendency definitions.

                                 in the chain of prior applications. See MPEP § 211.02 for guidance regarding

                              national application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) and 37 CFR 1.53(b) may claim
                              benefit of the filing date of an international application which designates the
                              United States without completing the requirements for entering the national stage
                              under 35 U.S.C. 371. See MPEP §§ 1895 and 1895.01. Thus, rather than submitting a
                              national stage application under 35 U.S.C. 371, applicant may file a continuation,
                              divisional, or continuation-in-part of an international (PCT) application under 35
                              U.S.C. 111(a). Such applications are often referred to as “bypass” applications. To
                              claim the benefit of the filing date of an international application, the
                              international application must designate the United States and be entitled to a
                              filing date in accordance with PCT Article 11, and the later-filed application must
                              be filed during the pendency (e.g., prior to the abandonment) of the international
                              application.

                           <p id="ch200_d1ff71_22f14_cd">The ability to take such action is based on
                              provisions of the United States patent law. 35 U.S.C. 363 provides that “An
                              international application designating the United States shall have the effect, from
                              its international filing date under article 11 of the treaty, of a national
                              application for patent regularly filed in the Patent and Trademark Office.” 35 U.S.C.
                              371(d) indicates that failure to timely comply with the requirements of 35 U.S.C.
                              371(c) “shall be regarded as abandonment by the parties thereof....” It is therefore
                              clear that an international application which designates the United States has the
                              effect of a pending U.S. application from the international application filing date
                              until its abandonment as to the United States. The first sentence of 35 U.S.C. 365(c)
                              specifically provides that “In accordance with the conditions and requirements of
                              section 120 of this title,... a national application shall be entitled to the benefit
                              of the filing date of a prior international application designating the United
                              States.” The condition of 35 U.S.C. 120 relating to the time of filing requires the
                              later application to be “filed before the patenting or abandonment of or termination
                              of proceedings on the first application....”

                              absence on the filing receipt, the Office will require a petition under 37 CFR 1.78
                              and the surcharge to correct the claim. The Office may not recognize any benefit
                              claim where, for example, there is no indication of the relationship between the
                              nonprovisional applications, or no indication of an intermediate nonprovisional
                              application that is directly claiming the benefit of a provisional application. See
                              subsection II, below. Even if the Office has recognized a benefit claim by entering
                              it into the Office’s database and including it on applicant’s filing receipt, the
                              benefit claim is not a proper benefit claim under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) or 35 U.S.C. 120

                              a prior provisional application is being claimed under 35 U.S.C. 119(e). No
                              relationship should be specified because whenever a priority claim to a provisional
                              application under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) is made, it is implicit that the relationship is
                              “nonprovisional application of a provisional application.” If a relationship between
                              a prior provisional application and the nonprovisional application is submitted, it
                              may be unclear whether the applicant wishes to claim the benefit of the filing date
                              of the provisional application under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) or 120. Thus, applicants
                              seeking to claim the priority to a provisional application under 35 U.S.C. 119(e)
                              should not state that the application is a “continuation” of a provisional
                              application or that the application claims 35 U.S.C. 120 benefit to a provisional
                              application. Although 35 U.S.C. 120 does not preclude a benefit claim to a
                              provisional application, it is not recommended that applicants claim the benefit to a
                              provisional application under 35 U.S.C. 120 since such a claim could have the effect
                              of reducing the patent term, as the term of a patent issuing from such an application
                              may be measured from the filing date of the provisional application pursuant to 35
                              U.S.C. 154(a)(2).

                                 new prior art may now be available if a benefit claim is deleted. If an applicant

                                 claim after final rejection or action, the amendment or ADS will be treated under
                                 37 CFR 1.116 (see MPEP § 714.12 and § 714.13). If the amendment or ADS to delete a

                                 or ADS will be treated under 37 CFR 1.312 (see MPEP § 714.16). A deletion of a

                                 prior application may be considered as a showing that the applicant is

                                 application. If the applicant later files a petition to accept an unintentionally
                                 delayed claim to add the benefit claim to the prior application in the same
                                 application from which the benefit claim was canceled, the Office may refuse to
                                 accept such benefit claim because the delay was not unintentional. The correction

                                 patented drill bit was the subject of a commercial offer for sale. A provisional
                                 application was filed after the sale offer, but well within the one year grace
                                 period of 35 U.S.C. 102(b). A nonprovisional application, which issued as Patent
                                 No. 5,899,283, was filed within one year of the filing of the provisional
                                 application but more than one year after the sale offer. If the ‘283 patent was
                                 not afforded the priority date of the provisional application, the patent would be
                                 invalid under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) since it was filed more than one year after the
                                 commercial offer for sale. The court looked at claim 1 of the ‘283 patent which
                                 recites a bit body <span class="Underline">being angled with respect to the sonde

                                 described as “being angled with respect to the sonde housing” as recited in claim
                                 1 of the ‘283 patent. The court held that the disclosure of the provisional
                                 application does not adequately support the invention claimed in the ‘283 patent
