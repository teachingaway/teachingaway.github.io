                                    a nonprovisional application filed under paragraph (b) of this section
                                    and accorded the original filing date of the provisional application. The

                                    will not result in either the refund of any fee properly paid in the
                                    provisional application or the application of any such fee to the filing
                                    fee, or any other fee, for the nonprovisional application. Conversion of
                                    a provisional application to a nonprovisional application under this
                                    paragraph will result in the term of any patent to issue from the
                                    application being measured from at least the filing date of the
                                    provisional application for which conversion is requested. Thus,
                                    applicants should consider avoiding this adverse patent term impact by
                                    filing a nonprovisional application claiming the benefit of the

                                    application pursuant to this paragraph). A request to convert a

                                    and the surcharge required by §

                           after the filing fee has been calculated and the filing date granted. If a preliminary
                           amendment which cancels claims does not accompany the application at the time the

                           fee will inform the inventor, attorney, or agent of the possibility of correcting the

                           filing an amendment which cancels claims so that the remaining claims are covered by the
                           fee submitted upon filing. However, no refund will be made once the fee for claims is
                           properly paid, even though claims are later canceled, unless a petition for express

                        <p id="d0e29849">The filing date of the provisional or
                           nonprovisional application is the date of receipt in the Office of the application which
                           includes a specification containing description pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320131">37 CFR
                                 1.71</a></b> and at least one claim (required for nonprovisional
                           applications only) pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320269">37 CFR 1.75</a></b>, and any drawings
                           required by <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320940">37 CFR 1.81(a)</a></b>. See

                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e29864">If any of these items are missing,
                           applicant will be notified to file them and the filing date will be the date of receipt
                           of the missing part(s). If the oath or declaration for a nonprovisional application was
                           executed and filed with the application, a supplemental oath or declaration by the
                           inventor is required in some circumstances if the nonprovisional application was filed
                           before September 16, 2012, e.g., where the missing item is the claim, specification, or
                           a drawing. The supplemental declaration must identify the missing item and indicate,
                           as&nbsp;appropriate, that it accurately claims, describes, or&nbsp;illustrates applicant’s
                           invention. See <b><a href="s601.html#d0e36116">MPEP §&nbsp;601.01(d)</a></b>-(g) where the
                           application is filed without all the pages of the specification, without at least one
                           claim (nonprovisional application), without drawings, or without all the figures of the
                           drawings. For applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, the Office will not
                           require a person who has executed an oath or declaration in compliance with 35 U.S.C.
                           115 and 37 CFR 1.63 or 1.162 for an application to provide an additional inventor’s oath
                           or declaration for the application (37 CFR 1.67(c)). An error in or failure to identify
                           inventorship does not raise a filing date issue.

                           filing date as of the date of deposit of the application would be by way of petition,
                           accompanied by the petition fee (<b><a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#d0e315199">37 CFR 1.17(f)</a></b>). Petitioner should
                           provide any arguments that he or she has that the items noted were not missing or that a
                           filing date should be assigned in the absence of such items if they are believed to be
                           unnecessary. If petitioner alleges that no defect exists, a request for refund of the
                           petition fee may be included in the petition.
