                              examination of the patent (e.g., in the examination of the application for the

                              applied by the Federal District Courts and the Office. While the Office may accord
                              deference to factual findings made by the court, the determination of whether a
                              SNQ/RLP xists will be made independently of the court’s decision on validity, because
                              it is not binding on the Office. See, e.g., <i>In re Swanson et al</i>,
                              540 F.3d 1368, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (Federal Circuit approved of the Office’s

                              requester was a party to the prior litigation resulting in the final court decision
                              that a patent claim is <i>not invalid</i>, see <b><a href="s2686.html#d0e269513">MPEP §
