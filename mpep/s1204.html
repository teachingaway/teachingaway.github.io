                        <p id="ch1200_d1fcfd_20f89_2f4">The definition of ‘‘Record’’ includes the
                           items listed in the content listing of the Image File Wrapper because, in some cases,
                           physical items that form part of the official file are not able to be scanned into the
                           Image File Wrapper and are maintained elsewhere, such as in an artifact file. Some
                           examples of such items include original drawings in design patent applications and
                           sequence listings. In such cases, the Image File Wrapper will include an entry in the
                           content listing that points to this artifact file or other record. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch1200_d1fcfd_20fc4_300">In the case of an issued patent being
                           reissued or reexamined, the Record further includes the Record of the patent being
                           reissued or reexamined. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch1200_d1fcfd_20fe9_266">All references listed on an Information
                           Disclosure Statement (i.e., Form PTO/SB/08a or 08b), which have been indicated as having
                           been considered by the examiner, or listed on a form PTO-892 are included in the
                           definition of Record even if each of the so listed references does not separately appear
                           in the content listing of the Image File Wrapper.

                        <p id="ch1200_d1fcfd_211d8_1af">For the purposes of appeal, ‘‘Evidence’’ does
                           not encompass dictionaries. Excluding dictionaries from the definition of ‘‘Evidence’’
                           thus allows appellants to refer to dictionaries in their briefs, which would otherwise
                           be precluded under 37 CFR 41.33(d)(2) (absent existence of one of the enumerated
                           exceptions). It further allows examiners to refer to dictionaries in the examiner’s
                           answers without automatically rendering a rejection a new ground under 37 CFR
                           41.39(a)(2). Treating dictionaries in this manner is consistent with Supreme Court and
                           Federal Circuit precedent, which contemplate that such materials may be consulted by
                           tribunals ‘‘at any time.’’ See, e.g., <i>Nix v. Hedden</i>, 149 U.S. 304,
                           307 (1893) (citations omitted) (admitting dictionaries to understand the ordinary
                           meaning of terms ‘‘not as evidence, but only as aids to the memory and understanding of
                           the court’’); <i>Phillips v. AWH Corp</i>., 415 F.3d 1303, 1322–23 (Fed.
                           Cir. 2005) (en banc) (‘‘[J]udges are free to consult dictionaries and technical
                           treatises at any time in order to better understand the underlying technology and may
                           also rely on dictionary definitions when construing claim terms, so long as the
                           dictionary definition does not contradict any definition found in or ascertained by a
                           reading of the patent documents.’’) (citation omitted);<i> In re Boon</i>,
                           439 F.2d 724, 727–28 (CCPA 1971) (holding citation to dictionary was not tantamount to
                           the assertion of a new ground of rejection ‘‘where such a reference is a standard work,
                           cited only to support a fact judicially noticed and, as here, the fact so noticed plays
                           a minor role, serving only to fill in the gaps which might exist in the evidentiary
                           showing made by the Examiner to support a particular ground for rejection.’’ (emphasis
                           and internal quotations omitted)). Thus, 37 CFR 41.30 permits both the applicant and
                           examiner to submit them to the Board during the briefing stage.
