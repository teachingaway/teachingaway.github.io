                        Office Handling of Duty of Disclosure/Inequitable Conduct
                        Issues [R-08.2012]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e196556">Determination of inequitable conduct
                        issues requires an evaluation of the intent of the party involved. While some court
                        decisions have held that intent may be inferred in some circumstances, consideration of the
                        good faith of the party, or lack thereof, is often required. In several court decisions, a
                        high level of proof of intent to mislead the Office was required in order to prove
                        inequitable conduct under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319407">37 CFR 1.56</a></b>. See <i>In re Harito</i>, 847 F.2d 801, 6 USPQ2d 1930 (Fed. Cir. 1988)
                        and <i>FMC Corp</i>. <i>v.</i><i>Manitowoc Co.</i>, 835 F.2d 1411, 5 USPQ2d 1112 (Fed. Cir.
                        1987). The Office is not the best forum in which to determine whether there was an “intent
                        to mislead”; such intent is best determined when the trier of facts can observe demeanor of
                        witnesses subjected to cross-examination. A court, with subpoena power, is presently the
                        best forum to consider duty of disclosure issues under the present evidentiary standard for
                        finding an “intent to mislead.” The court proceeding involves two participating adverse
                        parties. This is not the case in the Office, since even “protesting” parties are not
                        permitted to participate under the rules. Also, it is the courts and not the Office that
                        are in the best position to fashion an equitable remedy to fit the precise facts in those
                        cases where inequitable conduct is established. Furthermore, inequitable conduct is not set
                        by statute as a criteria for patentability but rather is a judicial application of the
                        doctrine of unclean hands which is appropriate to be handled by the courts rather than by
                        an administrative body. Because of the lack of tools in the Office to deal with this issue
                        and because of its sensitive nature and potential impact on a patent, Office determinations
                        generally will not deter subsequent litigation of the same issue in the courts on appeal or
                        in separate litigation. Office determinations would significantly add to the expense and
                        time involved in obtaining a patent with little or no benefit to the patent owner or any
                        other parties with an interest.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196574">Accordingly, the Office does not
                        investigate and reject original or reissue applications under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e319407">37 CFR
                              1.56</a></b>. Likewise, the Office will not comment upon duty of disclosure
                        issues which are brought to the attention of the Office in original or reissue applications
                        except to note in the application, in appropriate circumstances, that such issues are no
                        longer considered by the Office during its examination of patent applications. Examination
                        of lack of deceptive intent in reissue applications will continue but without any
                        investigation of inequitable conduct issues. Applicant’s statement of lack of deceptive
                        intent normally will be accepted as dispositive except in special circumstances such as an
                        admission or judicial determination of fraud or inequitable conduct. See notice published
                        in the <i>Official Gazette</i> at 1095 O.G. 16 (October 11,
                        1988). See <b><a href="s2022.html#d0e196967">also MPEP § 2022.05</a></b>.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e196593">Issues of fraud and/or inequitable
                        conduct in an interference proceeding before the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences
                        (Board) will be considered by the Board if they are raised by way of preliminary motion for
                        judgment under 37 CFR 1.633(a). The motion must be filed during the period set for filing
                        preliminary motions (37 CFR 1.636(a)), or good cause (37 CFR 1.655(b)) must be shown as to
                        why the issues of fraud and/or inequitable conduct were not timely raised during the
                        preliminary motion period. Issues of fraud and/or inequitable conduct will not be
                        considered in any interference in which the times for taking testimony or the times for
                        filing briefs for final hearing have already been set, unless 'good cause' is shown under
                        37 CFR 1.655(b). An example of good cause would be where fraud or inequitable conduct is
                        first discovered during taking of testimony. See notice published in the <i>Official Gazette</i> at 1133 O.G. 21 (December 10,
                        1991).
