                        			International Bureau contains two main sheets (“first sheet” and “second sheet”) to be
                        			used for all searches. These two main sheets are intended for recording the important
                        			features of the search such as the fields searched and for citing documents revealed by
                        			the search. The printed international search report form also contains five optional
                        			continuation sheets for use where necessary. They are the: “continuation of first sheet
                        			(1),” “continuation of first sheet (2),” “continuation of first sheet (3),”
                        			“continuation of second sheet” and “patent family annex,” respectively. The patent
                        			family annex sheet is not currently used by the United States International Searching
                        			Authority since patent family information is not readily available to the examiner. The
                        			“continuation of first sheet (1)” is to be used only when the international application
                        			includes a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence and indicates the basis on which the
                        			international search was carried out, since the relevant listings or related tables may
                        			be filed or furnished at different times and in different forms. The “continuation of
                        			first sheet (2)” is used where an indication is made on the first sheet that claims were
                        			found unsearchable (item 2) and/or unity of invention is lacking (item 3). The relevant
                        			indications must then be made on that continuation sheet. The “continuation of first
                        			sheet (3)” is to contain the text of the abstract where an abstract or an amended
                        			abstract has been established by the International Searching Authority (item 5) and an
                        			indication to that effect is made on the first sheet. The “continuation of second sheet”
                        			is to be used where the space on the second sheet is insufficient for the citation of
                        			documents. The form also includes an “extra sheet” which may be used whenever additional
                        			space is required to complete information from the other sheets.

                              					partial signatory authority.
