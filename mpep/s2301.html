                        Introduction [R-08.2012]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e237638">An interference is a contest under
                        <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303239">35
                              U.S.C. 135(a)</a></b> between an application and either another application
                        or a patent. An interference is declared to assist the Director of the United States Patent
                        and Trademark Office in determining priority, that is, which party first invented the
                        commonly claimed invention within the meaning of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383">35 U.S.C. 102(g)(1)</a></b>.
                        See <b><a href="s2301.html#d0e238030">MPEP §
                              2301.03</a></b>. Once an interference has been suggested under
                        <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e359547">37
                              CFR 41.202</a></b>, the examiner refers the suggested interference to the
                        Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board). An administrative patent judge declares
                        the interference, which is then administered at the Board. A panel of Board members enters
                        final judgment on questions of priority and patentability arising in an
                        interference.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e237653">Once the interference is declared, the
                        examiner generally will not see the application again until the interference has been
                        terminated. Occasionally, however, the Board may refer a matter to the examiner or may
                        consult with the examiner on an issue. Given the very tight deadlines in an interference,
                        any action on a consultation or referral from the Board must occur with special
                        dispatch.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e237656">The application returns to the examiner
                        after the interference has been terminated. Depending on the nature of the judgment in the
                        case, the examiner may need to take further action in the application. For instance, if
                        there are remaining allowable claims, the application may need to be passed to issue. The
                        Board may have entered a recommendation for further action by the examiner in the case. If
                        the applicant has lost an issue in the interference, the applicant may be barred from
                        taking action in the application or any subsequent application that would be inconsistent
                        with that loss.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e237659">Given the infrequency, cost, and
                        complexity of interferences, it is important for the examiner to consult immediately with
                        an Interference Practice Specialist (IPS) in the examiner’s Technology Center, see
                        <b><a href="s2302.html#d0e238168">MPEP §
                              2302</a></b>, once a possible interference is identified. It is also
                        important to complete examination before the possible interference is referred to the
                        Board. See <b><a href="s2303.html#d0e238280">MPEP § 2303</a></b>.

                              having ordinary skill in the art would have selected the applicant’s species from the
                              patentee’s genus. Generally the explanation should include citation to prior art
                              supporting the obviousness of the species. Without the explanation, the claims do not
                              interfere.

                              glue for fastening, while the patent discloses a rivet for fastening. Despite
                              otherwise identical claim language, the claims do not interfere unless it can be
                              shown that in this art glue and rivets were considered structurally equivalent or
                              would have rendered each other obvious.

                              except no specific surfactant is described. The application discloses that it is well
                              known in the art to use sodium lauryl sulfate as the surfactant in these types of
                              formulations. The claims interfere.

                              genus and a species within the genus. The interference is declared with two counts,
                              one directed to the genus and one directed to the species. The species claim would
                              correspond to the species count because the count would have anticipated the claimed
                              subject matter. The genus count would not ordinarily have anticipated the species
                              claim, however, so the species claim would only correspond to the genus count if
                              there was a showing that the genus count would have rendered the claimed species
                              obvious. The genus claim, however, would have been anticipated by both the genus
                              count and the species count and thus would correspond to both counts.
