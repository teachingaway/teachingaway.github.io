                        added in a reissue application and the original patent claims, where the added claims are
                        directed to an invention which is separate and distinct from the invention(s) defined by
                        the original patent claims. The criteria for making a restriction requirement in a reissue

                        because a reissue application is filed under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C. 251</a></b>, and not
                        under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164">35

                     <p id="d0e142662">Where a restriction requirement is made
                        by the examiner, the original patent claims will be held to be constructively elected
                        (except for the limited situation where a disclaimer is filed as discussed in the next
                        paragraph). Thus, the examiner will issue an Office action in the reissue application (1)
                        providing notification of the restriction requirement, (2) holding the added claims to be
                        constructively non-elected and withdrawn from consideration, (3) treating the original
                        patent claims on the merits, and (4) informing applicant that if the original claims are
                        found allowable, and a divisional application has been filed for the non-elected claims,
                        further action in the application will be suspended, pending resolution of the divisional
                        application. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e142665">If a disclaimer of all the original
                        patent claims is filed in the reissue application containing newly added claims that are
                        separate and distinct from the original patent claims, only the newly added claims will be
                        present for examination. In this situation, the examiner’s Office action will treat the
                        newly added claims in the reissue application on the merits. The disclaimer of all the
                        original patent claims must be filed in the reissue application before the issuance of the
                        examiner’s Office action containing the restriction requirement, in order for the newly
                        added claims to be treated on the merits. Once the examiner has issued the Office action
                        providing notification of the restriction requirement and treating the patent claims on the
                        merits, it is too late to obtain an examination on the&nbsp;added claims in the reissue
                        application by filing a disclaimer of all the original patent claims. If reissue applicant
                        wishes to have the newly added claims be treated on the merits, a divisional reissue
                        application must be filed to obtain examination of the added claims. Reissue applicants
                        should carefully note that once a disclaimer of the patent claims is filed, it cannot be
                        withdrawn. It does not matter whether the reissue application is still pending, or whether
                        the reissue application has been abandoned or issued as a reissue patent. For all these
                        situations, <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324830">37 CFR 1.176(b)</a></b> states that the
                        disclaimer cannot be withdrawn; the disclaimer will be given effect. Note that cancellation
                        of all the original patent claims in the reissue application will not be effective as an
                        alternative to disclaiming all the original patent claims, and 37 CFR 1.176(b) will not be
                        waived to permit the same. This is because the patent owner can subsequently file a reissue
                        continuation presenting the original patent claims.

                     <p id="d0e142676">Claims elected pursuant to a
                        restriction requirement will receive a complete examination on the merits, while the

                        status, and will only be examined if filed in a divisional reissue application. If the
                        reissue application containing only original unamended claims becomes allowable first (and
                        no “error” under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C. 251</a></b> exists),&nbsp;further action
                        in that reissue application will be suspended to await examination in the divisional
                        reissue application(s) containing the added claims. Multiple suspensions (usually six-month
                        periods) may be necessary. The Office will not permit claims to issue in a reissue
                        application which application does not correct any error in the original patent. Once a
                        divisional reissue application containing the added claims is examined and becomes
                        allowable, the examiner will issue a requirement under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324868">37 CFR 1.177(c)</a></b> for applicant to merge
                        the claims of the suspended first reissue application with the allowable claims of the
                        divisional reissue application into a single application, by placing all of the claims in
                        one of the applications and expressly abandoning the other. The Office action making this
                        requirement will set a two-month period for compliance with the requirement. If applicant
                        fails to timely respond to the Office action, or otherwise refuses to comply with the
                        requirement made, then the divisional reissue application (claiming the invention which was
                        non-elected in the now-suspended first reissue application) will be passed to issue alone,
                        since the claims of the divisional reissue application, by themselves, do correct an error
                        in the original patent. Prosecution will be reopened in the suspended first reissue
                        application, and a rejection based on a lack of error under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35&nbsp;U.S.C.
                              251</a></b> will then be made. This rejection may be made final, because
                        applicant is on notice of the consequences of not complying with the merger
                        requirement.

                        in that reissue application will be suspended, and a non-extendable three-month opportunity
                        will be given (by way of a 3-month Notification) to the patent owner/applicant to file
                        divisional reissue application(s) containing the non-elected claims. If a divisional
                        reissue application is timely filed (i.e., within the three months), further suspensions
                        (usually six-month periods) will be granted, as needed, to await examination in the
                        divisional reissue application containing the added claims. If no such divisional reissue
                        application is filed within the three-month period set in the Office communication
