                                    rejections, when timely presented, must be considered by the examiner whenever
                                    present. All entered affidavits, declarations, and other evidence traversing
                                    rejections are acknowledged and commented upon by the examiner in the next
                                    succeeding action. The extent of the commentary depends on the action taken by
                                    the examiner. Where an examiner holds that the evidence is sufficient to
                                    overcome the <i>prima facie</i> case, the comments
                                    should be consistent with the guidelines for&nbsp;statements of reasons for

                                    evidence is insufficient to overcome the rejection, the examiner must
                                    specifically explain why the evidence is insufficient. General statements such
                                    as “the declaration lacks technical validity” or “the evidence is not
                                    commensurate with the scope of the claims” without an explanation supporting
                                    such findings are insufficient.

                                 The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stated in <i>Stratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp.,</i> 713 F.2d 1530, 1538, 218&nbsp;USPQ
                                 871, 879 (Fed. Cir. 1983) that “evidence rising out of the so-called ‘secondary
                                 considerations’ must always when present be considered en route to a determination
                                 of obviousness.” Such evidence might give light to circumstances surrounding the
                                 origin of the subject matter sought to be patented. As indicia of obviousness or
                                 unobviousness, such evidence may have relevancy. <i>Graham

                                 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The lack of objective evidence of nonobviousness does not weigh

                                 evidence should not be evaluated for its ability to knockdown the <i>prima facie</i> case. All of the competent rebuttal

                                 Evidence of a greater than expected result may also be shown by demonstrating an

                              requires objective evidence that an art recognized problem existed in the art for a

                              of others to the issue of obviousness depends on several factors. First, the need
                              must have been a persistent one that was recognized by those of ordinary skill in the
