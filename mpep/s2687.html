                              terminating the prosecution. The cover sheet to be used is Notice of Intent to Issue
                              Reexamination Certificate Form PTOL-2068. As an attachment to the NIRC cover sheet,
                              the examiner will draft an examiner’s amendment canceling all live claims in the
                              reexamination proceeding. Check the appropriate box on PTOL-2068. In the remarks of
                              the examiner’s amendment, the examiner should point out why the claims have been
                              canceled. Since all claims are being canceled in the proceeding, no reasons for
                              patentability are attached. No panel review conference is needed in this instance, as
                              the issuance of the NIRC is essentially ministerial.

                              claims and canceled claims will be identified. All rejected or objected claims will
                              be canceled by formal examiner’s amendment (attached as part of the NIRC). Check the
                              appropriate box on Form PTOL-2068. In the remarks section of the examiner’s
                              amendment, the examiner should point out why the claims have been canceled. As to the
                              patentable claims, reasons for patentability must be provided for all such claims.
                              After the examiner has determined that the reexamination proceeding is ready for the
                              NIRC, the examiner will formulate a draft preliminary NIRC with attachments as
                              needed. The examiner will then inform his/her Central Reexamination Unit (CRU)
                              Supervisory Patent Reexamination Specialist (SPRS) or Technology Center (TC) Quality
                              Assurance Specialist (QAS) of his/her intent to issue the NIRC. The CRU SPRS/TC QAS
                              will convene a panel review conference, and the conference members will review the
                              patentability of the remaining patentable claim(s) pursuant to <b><a href="s2671.html#d0e261579">MPEP
                                    § 2671.03</a></b>. If the conference confirms the examiner’s
                              preliminary decision, the proposed NIRC shall be issued and signed by the examiner,
                              with the two or more other conferees initialing the action (as “conferee”) to
                              indicate their presence in the conference. If the conference does not confirm the
                              examiner’s decision (e.g., it is determined that one or more of the remaining claims
                              should be rejected), then the examiner will reevaluate and issue an appropriate
                              Office action. A panel review conference is not to be held as to any claim that was
                              in the case (proceeding) at the time the case was reviewed by the Board or a federal
                              court.

                           patent owner and obtain authorization to make an amendment. The only time an examiner’s

                           is needed to address matters that do not require the patent owner’s approval. However,
                           matters that do not require the patent owner’s approval are generally minor formal
                           matters. Thus, it would be rare for an examiner to need to withdraw the issued NIRC for
                           issuance of a new NIRC with an examiner’s amendment, since withdrawal of the NIRC should
                           not be done for minor formal matters. In view of this, any examiner’s amendment in an
