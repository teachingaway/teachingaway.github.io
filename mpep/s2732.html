                        the Office’s PALM system records for their applications through PAIR (see

                        file, when the petition to withdraw the holding of abandonment is granted, the receipt of a
                        paper on March 2 should be recorded on the Office’s PALM system records. If the papers or

                        <p id="ch2700_d1ffbc_16380_1a6">On December 1, 2001, the U.S. counsel sends
                           the three patents to the German attorney for review and appropriate action. On January
                           5, 2002, the German attorney receives a search report from the EPO that cites the three
                           previously cited patents, plus a fourth patent, which are all designatinged all as “X”
                           references. On January 15, 2002, the German attorney reviews the fourth patent and
                           compares it to the three patents cited in the U.S. prosecution. The German attorney
                           concludes that the fourth patent is duplicative of one of the three patents, and takes
                           no further action.
                        </p>
                        <p id="ch2700_d1ffbc_16399_68">On March 1, 2002, during a routine status
                           inquiry, the U.S. counsel is informed of the citation of the fourth patent by the EPO
                           and the decision of the German attorney that the information in the newly cited patent
                           was duplicative of the three patents previously cited by the USPTO. The U.S. counsel
                           also obtains copies of the newly cited patent on this date. On March 5, 2002, the U.S.
                           counsel files an IDS containing the newly cited patent, which is received at the USPTO
                           on the same date.

                     <div id="" class="Example"><b>Answer to Example C:</b><p id="ch2700_d1ffbc_163f9_4">The thirty-day period would be calculated from
                           January 5, 2002 . As such, the submission of the IDS would be determined to have not
                           been received, received within the thirty-day period in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#eff_20130401_d0e331798">37 CFR

                           pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#eff_20130401_d0e331702">37 CFR 1.704(c)(6)</a></b>,

                        <p id="ch2700_d1ffbc_16417_287">In this example, the USPTO would consider the
                           participation of the German attorney in the prosecution and decision-making as to the
                           relevance of the newly cited art vis-à-vis the previously cited three patents to be a
                           substantive participation in the U.S. prosecution. As such, the German attorney would be
                           considered by the USPTO to be a party covered by <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e319463">37 CFR
                                 1.56(c)</a></b>. Accordingly, evaluation of compliance with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#eff_20130401_d0e331798">37 CFR
                                 1.704(d)</a></b> would consider the date that the foreign counsel first
                           learned of the fourth patent (i.e., the newly cited reference).

                              1.705(c)</a></b> for reinstatement of reduced patent term adjustment will not
                        be considered a failure to engage in reasonable efforts to conclude prosecution (processing

                        The Office will not deem such a failure to engage in reasonable efforts to conclude
