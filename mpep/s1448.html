                        such issues are no longer considered by the Office during its examination of patent

                        applications filed before September 16, 2012 will continue but without any investigation of
                        fraud, inequitable conduct, or duty of disclosure issues. Applicant’s statement in the
                        reissue oath or declaration of lack of deceptive intent will be accepted as dispositive
                        except in special circumstances such as an admission or judicial determination of fraud,

                        <p id="d0e141897">An admission or judicial
                           determination of fraud, inequitable conduct, or violation of the duty of disclosure is a
                           special circumstance, because no investigation need be made. Accordingly, for a reissue
                           application filed before September 16, 2012, after consulting with the Technology Center
                           (TC) Training Quality Assurance Specialist (TQAS), a rejection should be made using the
                           appropriate one of form paragraphs <b><a href="#fp14.21.09">14.21.09.fti</a></b> or

                           conduct or violation of the duty of disclosure must be explicit, unequivocal, and not
                           subject to other interpretation. Where a rejection is made based upon such an admission
                           (see form paragraph <b><a href="#fp14.22">14.22</a></b>.fti below) and applicant responds with any
                           reasonable interpretation of the facts that would not lead to a conclusion of fraud,
                           inequitable conduct or violation of the duty of disclosure, the rejection should be
                           withdrawn. Alternatively, if applicant argues that the admission noted by the examiner
                           was not in fact an admission, the rejection should also be withdrawn.
