                              conducted in accordance with §§ <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324570">1.171</a></b>

                        that a reissue application examination and an <i>ex parte</i>

                        particular patent. The reason for this policy is to permit timely resolution of both
                        proceedings to the extent possible and to prevent inconsistent, and possibly conflicting,
                        amendments from being introduced into the two proceedings on behalf of the patent owner.
                        Accordingly, if both a reissue application and an <i>ex
                           parte</i> reexamination proceeding are pending concurrently on a patent, a
                        decision will normally be made (A) to merge the two proceedings or (B) to stay one of the
                        two proceedings. See <i>In re Onda</i>, 229 USPQ 235 (Comm’r
                        Pat. 1985). The decision as to whether the proceedings are to be merged, or which
                        proceeding (if any) is to be stayed is made in the Office of Patent Legal Administration
                        (OPLA).
