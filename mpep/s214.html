                        Formal Requirements of Claim for Foreign
                        Priority [R-11.2013]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="ch200_d1ff72_1e58f_327">Under the statute (35 U.S.C. 119(b)), an
                        applicant who wishes to secure the right of priority must comply with certain formal
                        requirements within a time specified. If these requirements are not complied with the right
                        of priority is lost and cannot thereafter be asserted.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch200_d1ff72_1e5b0_2f9">The maximum time limit specified in the statute
                        is that the claim for priority and the priority papers must be filed before the patent is
                        granted, but the statute gives the Director authority to set this time limit at an earlier
                        time during the pendency of the application. As a result of recent changes to the
                        applicable laws and rules, the procedural requirements for claiming priority to an
                        earlier-filed foreign application and submitting a certified copy thereof may vary based on
                        the filing date of the later-filed nonprovisional application. See MPEP § 214.01 for
                        procedural requirements pertaining to filing a claim for priority. See MPEP §§
                        215.02-215.03 for timing requirements for submitting a certified copy of the priority
                        application. See MPEP § 213.06 for claiming foreign priority and filing a certified copy in
                        a national stage application. It is noted that implementation of the Patent Law Treaty that
                        becomes effective on December 18, 2013 revises the procedural requirements and the time
                        relating to claims for priority of an earlier filed foreign application. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch200_d1ff72_1e5bc_aa">Where a claim for priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(b)
                        has not been made in the parent application, the claim for priority may be made in a
                        continuing application provided the parent application has been filed within 12 months from
                        the date of the earliest foreign filing. See <i>In re Tangsrud</i>, 184 USPQ
                        746 (Comm’r Pat. 1973). If the claim for priority and the certified copy of the priority
                        document are not filed in the continuing application within the time period set in 37 CFR
                        1.55, the right of priority is lost. A reissue was granted in <i>Brenner v. State of
                           Israel</i>, 400 F.2d 789, 158 USPQ 584 (D.C. Cir. 1968), where the only ground
                        urged was failure to file a certified copy of the original foreign application to obtain
                        the right of foreign priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 before the patent was
                        granted.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch200_d1ff72_1e67b_2db">It should be particularly noted that the
                        certified copy must be filed in all cases even though it may not be necessary during the
                        pendency of the application to overcome the date of any reference. The statute also gives
                        the Director authority to require a translation of the foreign documents if not in the
                        English language and such other information as the Director may deem
                        necessary.

                           certain time limit. The time limit specified in 35 U.S.C. 119(b)(1) is that the claim
                           for priority and the required identification information must be filed at such time
                           during the pendency of the application as set by the Director. The Director has by rule
                           set this time limit as the later of four months from the actual filing date of the
                           application or sixteen months from the filing date of the prior foreign application. See
                           37 CFR 1.55(d) and pre-March 16, 2013 37 CFR 1.55(a)(1)(i). This time period is not
                           extendable. In an application that entered the national stage from an international
                           application after compliance with 35 U.S.C. 371, the claim for priority must be made
                           during the pendency of the application and within the time limit set forth in the PCT
                           and the Regulations under the PCT. See 37 CFR 1.55(c) and pre-March 16, 2103 37 CFR
                           1.55(a)(1)(ii). Claims for foreign priority not presented within the time period
                           specified in 37 CFR 1.55are considered to have been waived. If a claim for priority
                           under 35 U.S.C.119(a) - (d) or (f), or 365(a) is presented after the time period set in
                           37 CFR 1.55, the claim may be accepted if it includes the required identification
                           information and is accompanied by a grantable petition to accept the unintentionally
                           delayed claim for priority.

                              certified copy must be accompanied by a processing fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(i).
                              The foreign priority claim or certified copy will be placed in the file record but
