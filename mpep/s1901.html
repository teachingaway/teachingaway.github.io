                           protestor ensures that the protest will receive maximum consideration and will be of the
                           most benefit to the Office in its examination of the application. A protest submitted

                              protestor to file such a duplicate before the protest is referred to the examiner.
                              Alternatively, if the protest involves only a few pages, the Office may, in its sole
                              discretion, elect to reproduce the protest rather than delay referring it to the

                              or agent by the Office, the application file should reflect that fact, either by a
