                              system, it is necessary to analyze the organization of the class or classes to be
                              included in the search.

                           <p id="d0e114225">The initial analysis should
                              determine which one or ones of the several types of subject matter (manufacture, art,
                              apparatus, or stock material) are contained in the class being
                              considered.

                                 Additional Purpose.</i> The added purpose is in excess of the scope of the
                              subject matter for the class, as defined in the class definition; e.g., adding a
                              sifter to a stone crusher which gives the added function of separating the crushed
                              stone.

                                 Feature</i>. Features may be added to the basic subject matter which do not
                              change the character thereof, but do perfect it for its intended purpose; e.g., an
                              overload release means tends to perfect a stonecrusher by providing means to stop it
                              on overload and thus prevent ruining the machine. However, this perfecting combined
                              feature adds nothing to the basic character of the machine.

                              e.g., a stonecrusher requires a minimum number of features as essential before it can
                              function as such.

                                 Matter.</i> Each type of basic subject matter may have subcombinations
                              specialized to use therewith; e.g., the crushing element of a
                              stonecrusher.

                           <p id="d0e114251"><i>Subcombinations of General Utility.</i> Each type of
                              basic subject matter may have subcombinations which have utility with other and
                              different types of subject matter; e.g., the machine elements of a stonecrusher.
                              Subcombinations of this character usually are provided for in some general class so
                              that the examiner should determine in each instance where they are
                              classified.

                              The SPC will assist the examiner in establishing any new subclass by (A) providing

                           classification is required for each claim which is classifiable in a different class or
                           subclass; some claims, particularly in chemical areas, may require plural
                           classifications. After all mandatory classifications have been determined, the
                           classification to be designated as the original (OR) is determined. If all mandatory
                           classifications are in the same class, the original classification is the mandatory
                           classification that, looking at the schedule from the top down, is the most indented
                           subclass array in which any classifications are assigned, in certain circumstances
                           (e.g., the genus-species array), however, modifications of this rule may apply. See the
                           “Examiner Handbook to the U.S. Patent Classification System” for an explanation of

                              may not indicate any truly relevant group. Accordingly, the Concordance must be
                              recognized as a <i>guide</i> to be used in conjunction
                              with the Int. Cl., and <i>not</i> as a translation
