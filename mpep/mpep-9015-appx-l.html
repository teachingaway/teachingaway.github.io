                              solicits a patent; and shall state of what country he is a citizen. Such oath may be
                              made before any person within the United States authorized by law to administer
                              oaths, or, when made in a foreign country, before any diplomatic or consular officer

                              applicant may be, whose authority is proved by certificate of a diplomatic or
                              consular officer of the United States, or apostille of an official designated by a
                              foreign country which, by treaty or convention, accords like effect to apostilles of
                              designated officials in the United States. Such oath is valid if it complies with the
                              laws of the state or country where made. When the application is made as provided in
                              this title by a person other than the inventor, the oath may be so varied in form
                              that it can be made by him. For purposes of this section, a consular officer shall

                                    Inventors may apply for a patent jointly even though (1) they did not
                                    physically work together or at the same time, (2) each did not make the same
                                    type or amount of contribution, or (3) each did not make a contribution to
                                    the subject matter of every claim of the patent.

                                    the Patent Trial and Appeal Board shall determine whether an inventor named
                                    in the earlier application derived the claimed invention from an inventor
                                    named in the petitioner’s application and, without authorization, the
                                    earlier application claiming such invention was filed. In appropriate
                                    circumstances, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board may correct the naming of
                                    the inventor in any application or patent at issue. The Director shall
                                    prescribe regulations setting forth standards for the conduct of derivation
                                    proceedings, including requiring parties to provide sufficient evidence to
                                    prove and rebut a claim of derivation.

                                    record, if any, it shall take action consistent with the agreement. Any

                              have the right, beginning at the date the applicant is notified that, except for such
                              order, his application is otherwise in condition for allowance, or February 1, 1952,

                              to the head of any department or agency who caused the order to be issued for
                              compensation for the damage caused by the order of secrecy and/or for the use of the
                              invention by the Government, resulting from his disclosure. The right to compensation
                              for use shall begin on the date of the first use of the invention by the Government.
                              The head of the department or agency is authorized, upon the presentation of a claim,
                              to enter into an agreement with the applicant, his successors, assigns, or legal
                              representatives, in full settlement for the damage and/or use. This settlement
                              agreement shall be conclusive for all purposes notwithstanding any other provision of
                              law to the contrary. If full settlement of the claim cannot be effected, the head of
                              the department or agency may award and pay to such applicant, his successors,
                              assigns, or legal representatives, a sum not exceeding 75 per centum of the sum which
                              the head of the department or agency considers just compensation for the damage
                              and/or use. A claimant may bring suit against the United States in the United States
                              Court of Federal Claims or in the District Court of the United States for the
                              district in which such claimant is a resident for an amount which when added to the
                              award shall constitute just compensation for the damage and/or use of the invention

                              date of issuance of such patent, to bring suit in the United States Court of Federal
                              Claims for just compensation for the damage caused by reason of the order of secrecy
