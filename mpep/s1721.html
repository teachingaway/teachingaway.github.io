                        Treatment of Court and Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences
                        Decisions Affecting Patent and Trademark Office Policy and Practice  [R-08.2012]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e163347">In the event the Board of Patent
                        Appeals and Interferences (Board) or court decision is one that significantly adds to the
                        body of law by, for example, addressing a new legal or procedural issue, or providing a new
                        interpretation of a prior decision, such a decision may result in an internal United States
                        Patent&nbsp;and Trademark Office (USPTO) memorandum pointing out the significance of the
                        decision to the examination process.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163350">When any examiner or supervisor in the
                        Patent Examining Corps concludes that a recent decision of&nbsp;the Board or a court affects
                        existing USPTO policy or practice, he or she should bring the matter to the attention of
                        his/her TC Director through normal chain-of-command procedures.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163353">When the TC Director believes that
                        guidance to the Corps is warranted as a result of a decision, the TC Director should
                        consult with the Associate Commissioner for Patent Examination Policy and provide a draft
                        of the guidance that is recommended as appropriate under the circumstances. The Associate
                        Commissioner for Patent Examination Policy will then consult appropriate Office officials,
                        as necessary, to formulate a recommendation to the Commissioner for Patents on the policy
                        implications of the opinion.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163366">It may be necessary for the Director,
                        General Counsel, Solicitor, Chief Administrative Patent Judge, Commissioner for Patents,
                        Associate Commissioner for Patent Examination Policy, Deputy Commissioner for Patents and
                        TC Director making the recommendation to meet to review and discuss the policy
                        ramifications of the opinion and recommended guidance to enable the Director to decide how
                        the USPTO will proceed.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163379">Communication of the decision on the
                        policy implications of the court or Board decision will normally take place by either
                        notice in the <i>Official Gazette</i> and/or via memorandum to
                        USPTO personnel. Ultimately, the policy implications of the decision will be officially
                        incorporated into the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure and Office of Patent Training
                        curriculum materials during the next update cycle for these reference
                        materials.
