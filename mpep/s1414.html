                                    claims of the patent, the reissue oath or declaration must also identify a
                                    claim that the application seeks to broaden. A general statement, e.g., that
                                    all claims are broadened, is not sufficient to satisfy this requirement. In
                                    identifying the error, it is sufficient that the reissue oath/declaration
                                    identify a single word, phrase, or expression in the specification or in an
                                    original claim, and how it renders the original patent wholly or partly
                                    inoperative or invalid. The corresponding corrective action which has been
                                    taken to correct the original patent need not be identified in the
                                    oath/declaration. If the initial reissue oath/declaration “states at least one
                                    error” in the original patent, and, <i>in
                                       addition</i>, recites the specific corrective action taken in the
                                    reissue application, the oath/declaration would be considered acceptable, even
                                    though the corrective action statement is not required.

                              determine only whether the reissue oath/declaration contains the required averment;
                              the examiner <span class="Underline">will not make any comment</span> as to whether it
                              appears that there was in fact deceptive intention (see <b><a href="s2022.html#d0e196967">MPEP § 2022.05</a></b>).
                              It is noted that a reissue oath/declaration will not be effective for any errors
                              which are corrected by a filing made after the execution of the reissue
                              oath/declaration, unless it is clear from the record that the parties executing the
                              document were aware of the nature of the correction when they executed the document.
                              Further, a reissue oath/declaration with an early date of execution cannot be filed
                              after a correction made later in time, to cover the correction made after the
                              execution date. This is so, even if the reissue oath/declaration states that all
                              errors up to the filing of the oath/declaration arose without any deceptive intention
                              on the part of the applicant.
