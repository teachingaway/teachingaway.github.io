                        than the day on which the issue fee is paid. Such a request must indicate that the

                        assignee will be printed on the patent where multiple names for the same party are
                        identified on the Fee(s) Transmittal form, PTOL-85B. Such multiple names may occur when
                        both a legal name and an “also known as” or “doing business as” name is also included. This
                        printing practice will not, however, affect the existing practice of recording assignments
                        with the Office in the Assignment Division. The assignee entry on form PTOL-85B should
                        still be completed to indicate the assignment data as recorded in the Office. For example,
                        the assignment filed in the Office and, therefore, the PTOL-85B assignee entry might read
                        “Smith Company doing business as (d.b.a.) Jones Company.” The assignee entry on the printed
                        patent will read “Smith Company.”

                        are identified in item 3 of the Fee(s) Transmittal form PTOL-85B, the patent will issue to
                        the applicant. Assignment data printed on the patent will be based solely on the
                        information so supplied. Assignment information printed on a patent is not updated after a
                        patent is issued, and may not be reflective of the assignment recorded in the Office
                        subsequent to the issuance of the patent. Detailed assignment information can be found by
                        performing an assignment search on the USPTO Web site and by inspecting the recorded
                        assignment documents.
