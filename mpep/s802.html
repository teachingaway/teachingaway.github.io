                           are claimed in one application. In <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324081">37 CFR 1.141</a></b>, the statement is made
                           that two or more “independent and distinct inventions” may not be claimed in one
                           application.

                           inventions as between which the Director may require restriction. This, in turn, depends
                           on the construction of the expression “independent and distinct”
                           inventions.

                        <p id="d0e97943">“Independent”, of course, means not
                           dependent, or unrelated. If “distinct” means the same thing, then its use in the statute
                           and in the rule is redundant. If “distinct” means something different, then the question
                           arises as to what the difference in meaning between these two words may be. The hearings
                           before the committees of Congress considering the codification of the patent laws
                           indicate that <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303040">35 U.S.C. 121</a></b>: “enacts as law
                           existing practice with respect to division, at the same time introducing a number of
                           changes.” 
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e97953">The report on the hearings does not
                           mention as a change that is introduced, the inventions between which the Director may
                           properly require division.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e97956">The term “independent” as already
                           pointed out, means not dependent, or unrelated. A large number of inventions between
                           which, prior to the 1952 Act, division had been proper, are dependent inventions, such
                           as, for example, combination and a subcombination thereof; as process and apparatus used
                           in the practice of the process; as composition and the process in which the composition
                           is used; as process and the product made by such process, etc. If section 121 of the
                           1952 Act were intended to direct the Director never to approve division between
                           dependent inventions, the word “independent” would clearly have been used alone. If the
                           Director has authority or discretion to restrict independent inventions only, then
                           restriction would be improper as between dependent inventions, e.g., the examples used
                           for purpose of illustration above. Such was clearly not the intent of Congress. Nothing
                           in the language of the statute and nothing in the hearings of the committees indicate
                           any intent to change the substantive law on this subject. On the contrary, joinder of
                           the term “distinct” with the term “independent”, indicates lack of such intent. The law
                           has long been established that dependent inventions (frequently termed related
                           inventions) such as used for illustration above may be properly divided if they are, in
                           fact, “distinct” inventions, even though dependent.

                           requiring an applicant to elect a single claimed invention (e.g., a combination or
                           subcombination invention, a product or process invention, a species within a genus) for
                           examination when two or more independent inventions and/or two or more distinct
                           inventions are claimed in an application.
