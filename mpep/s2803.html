                        authorize the Office to accept a request for supplemental examination from a party who is
                        not the patent owner. For example, a party who merely states that it is an exclusive

                     <p id="ch2800_d1feaa_1e5b6_3ab">The request must be filed by the owner(s) of the

                        must include an identification of the owner(s) of the entire right, title, and interest in
                        the patent requested to be examined, and a submission by the patent owner in compliance
                        with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e336784">37 CFR

                        requested to be examined. See <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1d8bb_13f5f_104">37 CFR 1.610(b)(9)</a></b>. This is because the
                        terms of a patent may be changed (e.g., by cancellation or amendment of the claims) during
                        any <i>ex parte</i> reexamination proceeding that may be ordered as a result of
                        the supplemental examination proceeding, and this change must be binding on all parties
                        having an ownership interest in the patent. Furthermore, the Office has consistently
                        required that all parties having an interest in a patent are deemed “a patent owner” as a
                        composite entity and must act together in proceedings before the Office. See
                        <b><a href="s301.html#d0e17687">MPEP §§

                        <i>ex parte</i> reexamination practice, which requires a patent owner
                        requester of an <i>ex parte</i> reexamination to comply with the provisions of

                        such a petition may be filed in the case of a deceased or legally incapacitated joint
                        owner, or where the <i>joint</i> owner refuses to join or cannot be found after
                        diligent effort. See <b><a href="s409.html#d0e22860">MPEP § 409</a></b><i>et seq</i>. In the case of a deceased joint owner, the heirs,
                        administrators, or executors of the joint owner may be permitted to join in filing the
                        request for supplemental examination. If one of the owners is legally incapacitated, the
                        legal representative of the joint owner may be permitted to join in filing the request for
                        supplemental examination. If a joint owner refuses to sign or cannot be found or reached
                        after diligent effort, the remaining owners must include, in the petition, proof of the
                        pertinent facts, a showing that such action is necessary to preserve the rights of the
                        parties or to prevent irreparable damage, and the last known address of all of the joint
                        owners. Finally, if an owner of all or a portion of the entire right, title, and interest
                        of the patent is an organization that is dissolved, the Office may require that a
                        determination of the ownership of the patent be obtained from a court of competent
                        jurisdiction prior to accepting and according a filing date to a request for supplemental
