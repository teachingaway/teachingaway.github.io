                              rejected, or both.” An amendment is “appropriate” under the rule if it amends one or
                              more of the claims rejected, or substitutes new claims to avoid the art or reasons

                              with regard to the new rejection, the Board’s affirmance of the examiner’s rejection
                              will be treated as nonfinal for purposes of seeking judicial review, and no request
                              for reconsideration of the affirmance need be filed at that time. Prosecution before

                              application to be allowed as a result of the limited prosecution before the examiner
                              of the <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356980">37 CFR 41.50(b)</a></b> rejection. If the

                              Likewise, if the application is abandoned for any reason, the application should not
                              be returned to the Board. If the rejection under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356980">37 CFR 41.50(b)</a></b>
                              is not overcome, the applicant can file a second appeal (as discussed below). Such
                              appeal must be limited to the <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356980">37 CFR 41.50(b)</a></b> rejection and may
                              not include the affirmed rejection. If the application does not become allowed or
                              abandoned as discussed above, once prosecution of the claims which were rejected

                           an appeal is presumed to be taken from the rejection of all claims. Where, in an appeal
                           brief filed before January 23, 2012, an appellant withdraws some of the appealed claims
                           (i.e., claims subject to a ground of rejection that the appellant did not present for
                           review in the brief), and the Board reverses the examiner on the remaining appealed
                           claims, the withdrawal is treated as an authorization to cancel the withdrawn claims. It
                           is necessary for the examiner to notify the appellant of the cancellation of the

                                    before the examiner, applicant must amend the newly rejected claims or

                                    the appeal should remain with the Board. The Board, having made the new

                                    instance. Should an examiner discover that a reply containing only arguments
                                    against a new ground of rejection has been returned to the examining corps,
                                    the appeal should be returned to the Board for appropriate
