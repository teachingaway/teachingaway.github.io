                        Rejection of Claims [R-11.2013]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e57973">After the application has been read and
                        the claimed invention understood, a prior art search for the claimed invention is made.
                        With the results of the prior art search, including any references provided by the
                        applicant, the patent application should be reviewed and analyzed in conjunction with the
                        state of the prior art to determine whether the claims define a useful, novel, nonobvious,
                        and enabled invention that has been clearly described in the specification. The goal of
                        examination is to clearly articulate any rejection early in the prosecution process so that
                        the applicant has the opportunity to provide evidence of patentability and otherwise reply
                        completely at the earliest opportunity. The examiner then reviews all the evidence,
                        including arguments and evidence responsive to any rejection, before issuing the next
                        Office action. Where the examiner determines that information reasonably necessary for the
                        examination should be required from the applicant under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322262">37 CFR 1.105</a></b>, such a
                        requirement should generally be made either prior to or with the first Office action on the
                        merits and should follow the procedures in <b><a href="s704.html#d0e55758">MPEP ยง&nbsp;704.10</a></b><i>et seq</i>.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e57985">Although this part of the Manual
                        explains the procedure in rejecting claims, the examiner should never overlook the
                        importance of his or her role in allowing claims which properly define the
                        invention.

                                    for want of novelty or for obviousness, the examiner must cite the best
                                    references at his or her command. When a reference is complex or shows or
                                    describes inventions other than that claimed by the applicant, the
                                    particular part relied on must be designated as nearly as practicable.
                                    The pertinence of each reference, if not apparent, must be clearly
                                    explained and each rejected claim specified.

                                    owner in a reexamination proceeding, as to any matter affecting
                                    patentability and, insofar as rejections in applications are concerned,

                           applied in the examination of claims must be the same throughout the Office. In every

                           all of the requirements for patentability (e.g., patent eligible, useful, novel,
                           nonobvious, enabled, and clearly described as provided in <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C.

                           mere fact that a claim recites in detail all of the features of an invention (i.e., is a

                           โpreponderance of the evidenceโ test. In other words, an examiner should reject a claim
                           if, in view of the prior art and evidence of record, it is more likely than not that the

                              documents which may not be in the English language. When an abstract is used to
                              support a rejection, the evidence relied upon is the facts contained in the abstract,
                              not additional facts that may be contained in the underlying full text document.
                              Citation of and reliance upon an abstract without citation of and reliance upon the
                              underlying scientific document is generally inappropriate where both the abstract and

                              Inter. 2001) (unpublished).To determine whether both the abstract and the underlying
                              document are prior art, a copy of the underlying document must be obtained and
                              analyzed. If the document is in a language other than English and the examiner seeks
                              to rely on that document, a translation must be obtained so that the record is clear
                              as to the precise facts the examiner is relying upon in&nbsp;support of the rejection. The
                              record must also be&nbsp;clear as to whether the examiner is relying upon the abstract or
                              the full text document to support a rejection. The rationale for this is
                              several-fold. It is not uncommon for a full text document to reveal that the document
                              fully anticipates an invention that the abstract renders obvious at best. The
                              converse may also be true, that the full text document will include teachings away
                              from the invention that will preclude an obviousness rejection under

                              rejection. An abstract can have a different effective publication date than the full
                              text document. Because all patentability determinations are fact dependent, obtaining
                              and considering full text documents at the earliest practicable time in the
                              examination process will yield the fullest available set of facts upon which to
                              determine patentability, thereby improving quality and reducing pendency.When
                              <span class="Underline">both</span> the abstract and the underlying
                              document qualify as prior art, the underlying document should normally be used to
                              support a rejection. In limited circumstances, it may be appropriate for the examiner
                              to make a rejection in a non-final Office action based in whole or in part on the
                              abstract only without relying on the full text document. In such circumstances, the
                              full text document and a translation (if not in English) may be supplied in the next
                              Office action. Whether the next Office action may be made final is governed by

                                    pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c) in that both concern common ownership, and both offer
                                    an avenue by which an applicant may avoid certain prior art. However, there are
                                    significant differences between 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C) and pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.

                                    U.S.C. 102(a) for two reasons. First, if the reference is a U.S. patent or
                                    patent application publication of, or claims benefit of, an international
                                    application, the publication of the international application under PCT Article
                                    21(2) may be the earliest prior art date under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) for the
                                    disclosure. Second, references that are only prior art under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
                                    102(e), (f), or (g) and applied in a rejection under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)

                                    reference and the application were commonly owned, or subject to an obligation
                                    of common assignment, at the time the invention was made. For pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
                                    102(a) to apply, the reference must have a publication date earlier in time
                                    than the effective filing date of the application, and must not be applicantโs

                           <p id="d0e62471">It is important for an examiner to
                              properly communicate the basis for a rejection so that the issues can be identified
                              early and the applicant can be given fair opportunity to reply. Furthermore, if an
                              initially rejected application issues as a patent, the rationale behind an earlier
                              rejection may be important in interpreting the scope of the patent claims. Since
                              issued patents are presumed valid (<b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305845">35 U.S.C. 282</a></b>)

                              record must be clear as to the basis for the grant. Since patent examiners cannot
                              normally be compelled to testify in legal proceedings regarding their mental
                              processes (see <b><a href="s1701.html#d0e162459">MPEP ยง 1701.01</a></b>), it is important
                              that the written record clearly explain the rationale for decisions made during
                              prosecution of the application.

                           both the applicant and the public, the invention as disclosed and claimed should be
