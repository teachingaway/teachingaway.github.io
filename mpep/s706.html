                        Rejection of Claims [R-11.2013]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e57973">After the application has been read and
                        the claimed invention understood, a prior art search for the claimed invention is made.
                        With the results of the prior art search, including any references provided by the
                        applicant, the patent application should be reviewed and analyzed in conjunction with the
                        state of the prior art to determine whether the claims define a useful, novel, nonobvious,
                        and enabled invention that has been clearly described in the specification. The goal of
                        examination is to clearly articulate any rejection early in the prosecution process so that
                        the applicant has the opportunity to provide evidence of patentability and otherwise reply
                        completely at the earliest opportunity. The examiner then reviews all the evidence,
                        including arguments and evidence responsive to any rejection, before issuing the next
                        Office action. Where the examiner determines that information reasonably necessary for the
                        examination should be required from the applicant under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322262">37 CFR 1.105</a></b>, such a
                        requirement should generally be made either prior to or with the first Office action on the
                        merits and should follow the procedures in <b><a href="s704.html#d0e55758">MPEP §&nbsp;704.10</a></b><i>et seq</i>.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e57985">Although this part of the Manual
                        explains the procedure in rejecting claims, the examiner should never overlook the
                        importance of his or her role in allowing claims which properly define the
                        invention.

                                    for want of novelty or for obviousness, the examiner must cite the best
                                    references at his or her command. When a reference is complex or shows or
                                    describes inventions other than that claimed by the applicant, the
                                    particular part relied on must be designated as nearly as practicable.
                                    The pertinence of each reference, if not apparent, must be clearly
                                    explained and each rejected claim specified.

                                    owner in a reexamination proceeding, as to any matter affecting
                                    patentability and, insofar as rejections in applications are concerned,

                        <p id="d0e58081">The standards of patentability
                           applied in the examination of claims must be the same throughout the Office. In every
                           art, whether it be considered “complex,” “newly developed,” “crowded,” or “competitive,”
                           all of the requirements for patentability (e.g., patent eligible, useful, novel,
                           nonobvious, enabled, and clearly described as provided in <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C.

                           <b><a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">112</a></b>) must be met before a claim is allowed. The
                           mere fact that a claim recites in detail all of the features of an invention (i.e., is a
                           “picture” claim) is never, in itself, justification for the allowance of such a claim.

                           course of examination and prosecution, since otherwise the resultant patent would not
                           justify the statutory presumption of validity (<b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305845">35 U.S.C. 282</a></b>), nor
                           would it “strictly adhere” to the requirements laid down by Congress in the 1952 Act as
                           interpreted by the Supreme Court. The standard to be applied in all cases is the
                           “preponderance of the evidence” test. In other words, an examiner should reject a claim
                           if, in view of the prior art and evidence of record, it is more likely than not that the
                           claim is unpatentable.

                           omission of a limitation, the examiner should not stop with a bare objection or
                           rejection of the claims. The examiner’s action should be constructive in nature and when

                           by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, while an objection, if persisted, may be reviewed

                              the claimed subject matter of a patent application often includes English language
                              abstracts of underlying documents, such as technical literature or foreign patent
                              documents which may not be in the English language. When an abstract is used to
                              support a rejection, the evidence relied upon is the facts contained in the abstract,
                              not additional facts that may be contained in the underlying full text document.
                              Citation of and reliance upon an abstract without citation of and reliance upon the
                              underlying scientific document is generally inappropriate where both the abstract and
                              the underlying document are prior art. See <i>Ex

                              Inter. 2001) (unpublished).To determine whether both the abstract and the underlying
                              document are prior art, a copy of the underlying document must be obtained and
                              analyzed. If the document is in a language other than English and the examiner seeks
                              to rely on that document, a translation must be obtained so that the record is clear
                              as to the precise facts the examiner is relying upon in&nbsp;support of the rejection. The
                              record must also be&nbsp;clear as to whether the examiner is relying upon the abstract or
                              the full text document to support a rejection. The rationale for this is
                              several-fold. It is not uncommon for a full text document to reveal that the document

                                    of the claimed invention, “were owned by the same person or subject to an
                                    obligation of assignment to the same person.” 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C) resembles
                                    pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c) in that both concern common ownership, and both offer
                                    an avenue by which an applicant may avoid certain prior art. However, there are
                                    significant differences between 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C) and pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.

                                    U.S.C. 102(a) for two reasons. First, if the reference is a U.S. patent or
                                    patent application publication of, or claims benefit of, an international
                                    application, the publication of the international application under PCT Article
                                    21(2) may be the earliest prior art date under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) for the
                                    disclosure. Second, references that are only prior art under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
                                    102(e), (f), or (g) and applied in a rejection under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)

                                    reference and the application were commonly owned, or subject to an obligation
                                    of common assignment, at the time the invention was made. For pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.
                                    102(a) to apply, the reference must have a publication date earlier in time
                                    than the effective filing date of the application, and must not be applicant’s
                                    own work.

                           <p id="d0e62471">It is important for an examiner to
                              properly communicate the basis for a rejection so that the issues can be identified
                              early and the applicant can be given fair opportunity to reply. Furthermore, if an
                              initially rejected application issues as a patent, the rationale behind an earlier
                              rejection may be important in interpreting the scope of the patent claims. Since
                              issued patents are presumed valid (<b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305845">35 U.S.C. 282</a></b>)
                              and constitute a property right (<b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305441">35 U.S.C. 261</a></b>), the written
                              record must be clear as to the basis for the grant. Since patent examiners cannot
                              normally be compelled to testify in legal proceedings regarding their mental
                              processes (see <b><a href="s1701.html#d0e162459">MPEP § 1701.01</a></b>), it is important
                              that the written record clearly explain the rationale for decisions made during
                              prosecution of the application.

                              <li class="nobull">1. It is necessary for the words
                                 which precede “means” to convey a function to be performed. For example, the phrase
                                 “latch means” is definite because the word “latch” conveys the function “latching.” In
                                 general, if the phrase can be restated as “means for ________,” and it still makes
                                 sense, it is definite. In the above example, “latch means” can be restated as “means for
                                 latching.” This is clearly definite. However, if “conduit means” is restated as “means
                                 for conduiting,” the phrase makes no sense because the word “conduit” has no functional
                                 connotation, and the phrase is indefinite.

                                 1020 (Bd. App. 1982). The claim scope is uncertain since the trademark or trade name cannot be

                           clear issue should be developed between the examiner and applicant. To bring the

                           both the applicant and the public, the invention as disclosed and claimed should be
                           thoroughly searched in the first action and the references fully applied; and in reply
                           to this action the applicant should amend with a view to avoiding all the grounds of
                           rejection and objection. Switching from one subject matter to another in the claims
                           presented by applicant in successive amendments, or from one set of references to
                           another by the examiner in rejecting in successive actions claims of substantially the
                           same subject matter, will alike tend to defeat attaining the goal of reaching a clearly
                           defined issue for an early termination, i.e., either an allowance of the application or
                           a final rejection.

                           rejection, examiners should not make hasty and ill-considered final rejections. The
                           applicant who is seeking to define his or her invention in claims that will give him or
                           her the patent protection to which he or she is justly entitled should receive the
                           cooperation of the examiner to that end, and not be prematurely cut off in the
                           prosecution of his or her application.

                           of the fact that in every case the applicant is entitled to a full and fair hearing, and

                           before appeal. However, it is to the interest of the applicants as a class as well as to
                           that of the public that prosecution of an application be confined to as few actions as
                           is consistent with a thorough consideration of its merits.
