                     <p id="d0e42405">To obtain a valid patent, a patent
                        application as filed must contain a full and clear disclosure of the invention in the
                        manner prescribed by 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph. The
                        requirement for an adequate disclosure ensures that the public receives something in return
                        for the exclusionary rights that are granted to the inventor by a patent. All amendments
                        and claims must find descriptive basis in the original disclosure.No new matter may be
                        introduced into an application after its filing date. Applicant may rely for disclosure
                        upon the specification with original claims and drawings, as filed. See also

                        any race, religion, sex, ethnic group, or nationality, he or she should object to the use
                        of the language as failing to comply with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313161">37 CFR 1.3</a></b> which

                        the public interest. Also, the inclusion in application drawings of any depictions or
                        caricatures that might reasonably be considered offensive to any group should be similarly
                        objected to,.

                           description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using the same.
                           The specification must be in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any
                           person skilled in the art or science to which the invention pertains to make and use the
                           same. See <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">35 U.S.C. 112</a></b> and <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320131">37 CFR

                           revision of the application should be required. See <b><a href="s702.html#d0e55492">MPEP §

                           that is not related to applicant’s invention, e.g., prospective disclaimers regarding
                           comments made by examiners. If such information is included in the written description,

                           action, e.g., cancel the information. The specification must commence on a separate
                           sheet. Each sheet including part of the specification may not include other parts of the
                           application or other information. The claim(s), abstract and sequence listing (if any)
                           should not be included on a sheet including any other part of the application

                                          right of the left margin as the first item in each paragraph,
                                          before the first word of the paragraph, and should be highlighted
                                          in bold. A gap, equivalent to approximately four spaces, should

                                          independently numbered. If a nontext element extends to the left
                                          margin, it should not be numbered as a separate and independent

                              to file patent applications, and papers that are to become a part of the permanent
                              United States Patent and Trademark Office records in the file of a patent application
                              or a reexamination proceeding, in a form that is clear and reproducible. If the
                              papers are not of the required quality, substitute papers of suitable quality will be
                              required. See <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323278">37 CFR 1.125</a></b> for filing rewritten

                              special coating so that erasures can be made more easily may not provide a
                              “permanent” copy, 37 CFR 1.52(a)(1)(iv). Since application papers are now maintained
                              in an Image File Wrapper, the type of paper is unlikely to be an issue so long as the

                              Second, the filing of a large number of applications under the procedure will create

                                       has an annular valve body defining an orifice and a plurality of struts
                                       forming a pair of cages on opposite sides of the orifice. A spherical
                                       closure member is captively held within the cages and is moved by blood flow
                                       between open and closed positions in check valve fashion. A slight leak or
                                       backflow is provided in the closed position by making the orifice slightly
                                       larger than the closure member. Blood flow is maximized in the open position
                                       of the valve by providing an inwardly convex contour on the orifice-defining
                                       surfaces of the body. An annular rib is formed in a channel around the
                                       periphery of the valve body to anchor a suture ring used to secure the valve
                                       within a heart.

                                       made from paperboard having an extremely thin coating of moisture-proofing
                                       thermoplastic material on opposite surfaces. Heated air is directed at the
                                       surfaces to be bonded, the temperature of the air at the point of impact on
                                       the surfaces being above the char point of the board. The duration of
                                       application of heat is made so brief, by a corresponding high rate of
                                       advance of the boxes through the air stream, that the coating on the reverse
                                       side of the panels remains substantially non-tacky. Under such conditions
                                       the heat applied to soften the thermoplastic coating is dissipated after
                                       completion of the bond by absorption into the board acting as a heat sink
                                       without the need for cooling devices.

                              concealment (accidental or intentional) is to be considered. That evidence must tend
                              to show that the quality of an applicant’s best mode disclosure is so poor as to

                                 fee purposes, as to whether a claim is dependent must be made by persons other
                                 than examiners; it is necessary, at that time, to accept as dependent virtually
                                 every claim which refers to another claim, without determining whether there is
                                 actually a true dependent relationship. The initial acceptance of a claim as a
                                 dependent claim does not, however, preclude a subsequent holding by the examiner
                                 that a claim is not a proper dependent claim.

                                 would not render it an improper dependent claim.

                                 the latter improper. Thus, if claim 1 recites a specific product, a claim for the
                                 method of making the product of claim 1 in a particular manner would be a proper
                                 dependent claim since it could not be infringed without infringing claim 1.
                                 Similarly, if claim 1 recites a method of making a product, a claim for a product
                                 made by the method of claim 1 could be a proper dependent claim. On the other
                                 hand, if claim 1 recites a method of making a specified product, a claim to the
                                 product set forth in claim 1 would not be a proper dependent claim since it is
                                 conceivable that the product claim can be infringed without infringing the base
                                 method claim if the product can be made by a method other than that recited in the
                                 base method claim.

                                 public with a patent disclosure which minimizes the public’s burden to search for
                                 and obtain copies of documents incorporated by reference which may not be readily
                                 available. Through the Office’s incorporation by reference policy, the Office

                                    by reference practice with respect to applications which are to issue as U.S.
                                    patents is to provide the public with a patent disclosure which minimizes the
                                    public’s burden to search for and obtain copies of documents incorporated by
                                    reference which may not be readily available. Through the Office’s
                                    incorporation by reference policy, the Office ensures that reasonably complete
                                    disclosures are published as U.S. patents. The same policy concern does not
                                    apply where the sole purpose for which an applicant relies on an earlier U.S.
                                    or foreign application is to establish an earlier filing date. Incorporation by
                                    reference in the earlier application of (1) patents or applications published
                                    by foreign countries or regional patent offices, (2) nonpatent publications,
                                    (3) a U.S. patent or application which itself incorporates “essential material”
                                    by reference, or (4) a foreign application, is not critical in the case of a
                                    “benefit” application.

                                    another earlier filed foreign application. If necessary, due to an intervening

                              trade name has a fixed and definite meaning, it constitutes sufficient identification

                                          corresponding to the view number of the sectional view, and should
                                          have arrows to indicate the direction of sight. Hatching must be
                                          used to indicate section portions of an object, and must be made by
                                          regularly spaced oblique parallel lines spaced sufficiently apart
                                          to enable the lines to be distinguished without difficulty.
                                          Hatching should not impede the clear reading of the reference
                                          characters and lead lines. If it is not possible to place reference
                                          characters outside the hatched area, the hatching may be broken off
                                          wherever reference characters are inserted. Hatching must be at a
                                          substantial angle to the surrounding axes or principal lines,
                                          preferably 45°. A cross section must be set out and drawn to show

                                          cross section was taken. The parts in cross section must show
                                          proper material(s) by hatching with regularly spaced parallel
                                          oblique strokes, the space between strokes being chosen on the
                                          basis of the total area to be hatched. The various parts of a cross
                                          section of the same item should be hatched in the same manner and
                                          should accurately and graphically indicate the nature of the
                                          material(s) that is illustrated in cross section. The hatching of
                                          juxtaposed different elements must be angled in a different way. In
                                          the case of large areas, hatching may be confined to an edging
                                          drawn around the entire inside of the outline of the area to be
                                          hatched. Different types of hatching should have different
                                          conventional meanings as regards the nature of a material seen in
                                          cross section.

                                    is encouraged if it aids in understanding the invention and if it does
                                    not reduce legibility. Shading is used to indicate the surface or shape
                                    of spherical, cylindrical, and conical elements of an object. Flat parts
                                    may also be lightly shaded. Such shading is preferred in the case of
                                    parts shown in perspective, but not for cross sections. See paragraph
                                    (h)(3) of this section. Spaced lines for shading are preferred. These
                                    lines must be thin, as few in number as practicable, and they must

                              was not acceptable.

                              acceptable. Drawings that do not comply with all of the form requirements of 37 CFR
                              1.84, e.g., because they are not on the proper size sheets, or the quality of the
                              lines is poor, may be acceptable for the purposes of publication and examination if
                              the drawings are readable and reproducible for publication purposes. An objection
                              will generally only be made to a drawing that does not comply with the form
                              requirements of 37 CFR 1.84 if the Office is unable to reproduce the drawing or the
                              contents of the drawing are unacceptable to the examiner.

                              preliminary amendments and reduce delays in processing the
                              application.

                              to amendments to the specification, review of the examiner’s requirement for
                              cancelation is by way of petition. But where the alleged new matter is introduced
                              into or affects the claims, thus necessitating their rejection on this ground, the
                              question becomes an appealable one, and should not be considered on petition even
                              though that new matter has been introduced into the specification also. See also

                              erased or rewritten. A CD-R is a compact disc that has a recording medium only
                              capable of writing once. CD-RW type media which are erasable and rewriteable are not
                              acceptable. Limiting the media types to CD-ROM and CD-R media will ensure the
                              longevity and integrity of the data submitted. CD-R discs must be finalized so that
                              they are closed to further writing to the CD-R. The files stored on the compact disc
                              must contain only ASCII characters. No non-ASCII characters or proprietary file
                              formats are permitted. A text viewer is recommended for viewing ASCII files. While

                              since a word processor will often not distinguish ASCII and non-ASCII files when
                              displayed. For example, a word processor normally does not display hidden proprietary
                              non-ASCII characters used for formatting when viewing a non-ASCII word processor

                              copies should initially be routed to the Office of Patent Application Processing
                              (OPAP). The compact discs will be checked by OPAP for viruses, readability, the
                              presence of non-ASCII files, and compliance with the file and disc labeling
                              requirements. OPAP will retain one copy of the discs and place the other copy in an
                              artifact folder associated with the Image File Wrapper. In the event that there is
                              not a complete set of files on both copies of the originally filed discs, OPAP will
                              retain the originally filed discs and send a notice to the applicant to submit an
                              additional complete copy. For provisional applications, OPAP will provide applicant
                              notification and, where appropriate, require correction for virus infected compact
                              discs, unreadable compact discs (or unreadable files thereon), and missing duplicate
                              discs. An amendment to the material on a compact disc must be done by submitting a
                              replacement compact disc with the amended file(s). The amendment should include a
                              corresponding amendment to the description of the compact disc and the files
                              contained on the compact disc in the incorporation by reference portion of the
                              specification. A replacement compact disc containing the amended files must contain
                              all of the files of the original compact disc that were not amended. This will insure
                              that the Office, printer, and public can quickly access all of the current files in
                              an application or patent by referencing only the latest electronic version of the

                                 directly or as a computer program listing on compact disc appendix to the
                                 specification and be incorporated into the specification by reference.
