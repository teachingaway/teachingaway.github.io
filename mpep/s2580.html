                        of the Office to accept and record a maintenance fee which was filed prior to the
                        expiration of the patent to petition the Director to accept and record the maintenance fee.

                        with an incorrect mandatory identifier was made near the end of the grace period, the
                        patent might expire since the Office would not credit the fee to the patent. A petition

                        different patent but through error identified the wrong patent number and application

                        where the entire maintenance fee payment, including any necessary surcharge, was not filed
