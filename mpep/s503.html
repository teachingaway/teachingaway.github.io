                           number, in combination with the application number, is used to verify the accuracy of
                           the application number placed on correspondence filed with the Office to avoid
                           misidentification of an application due to a transposition error in the application

                           Information Retrieval (PAIR) system. The Office eventually plans to include the

                           actions and notices concerning the application. The confirmation number must be used
                           when submitting an electronic filing system (EFS-Web) copy of the application for
                           publication to verify that the application number correctly identifies the application
                           for which a copy is being submitted for&nbsp;publication. The Office also recommends that
                           applicants include the application’s confirmation number (in addition to the application
                           number) on all correspondence submitted to the Office concerning the
