                        a statement in which patent owner took a position on the scope of any claim in the patent.
                        Identification of the portions of the papers required by 37 CFR 1.501(a)(3)(ii) can be

                        where the patent owner claim scope statements are found. The requirement of 37 CFR
                        1.501(a)(3)(iii) ensures that the statement is one in which patent owner has taken a
                        position on claim scope in a proceeding and not merely a restatement of a position asserted
                        by another party. Other information can be provided by the submitter to assist the Office
                        in readily identifying the patent owner claim scope statement, such as (1) information
                        regarding the status of the proceeding and (2) the relationship of the proceeding to the
                        patent.

                        which raises the issue of obviousness of at least one patent claim. Together with the cited
