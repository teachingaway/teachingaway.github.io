                              reply to the Office action. The reply by the applicant or patent owner must be
                              reduced to a writing which distinctly and specifically points out the supposed
                              errors in the examiner’s action and must reply to every ground of objection and
                              rejection in the prior Office action. The reply must present arguments pointing
                              out the specific distinctions believed to render the claims, including any
                              newly presented claims, patentable over any applied references. If the reply is
                              with respect to an application, a request may be made that objections or
                              requirements as to form not necessary to further consideration of the claims be
                              held in abeyance until allowable subject matter is indicated. The applicant’s
                              or patent owner’s reply must appear throughout to be a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to advance the application or
                              the reexamination proceeding to final action. A general allegation that the
                              claims define a patentable invention without specifically pointing out how the
                              language of the claims patentably distinguishes them from the references does
                              not comply with the requirements of this section.

                              applicant or patent owner must clearly point out the patentable novelty which
                              he or she thinks the claims present in view of the state of the art disclosed
                              by the references cited or the objections made. The applicant or patent owner
                              must also show how the amendments avoid such references or
                              objections.
