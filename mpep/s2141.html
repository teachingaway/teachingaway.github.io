               EXAMINATION GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING OBVIOUSNESS UNDER 35
              U.S.C. 103 
            </h2>
            <p id="d0e208261">These guidelines are intended to assist Office personnel to
              make a proper determination of obviousness under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450">35 U.S.C. 103</a></b>, and
              to provide an appropriate supporting rationale in view of the recent decision by the
              Supreme Court in <i>KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc.
               (KSR),</i> 550 U.S. 398, 82 USPQ2d 1385 (2007). The guidelines are based on the
              Office’s current understanding of the law, and are believed to be fully consistent with
              the binding precedent of the Supreme Court. The <i>KSR</i> decision
              reinforced earlier decisions that validated a more flexible approach to providing
              reasons for obviousness. However, the Supreme Court’s pronouncement in
              <i>KSR</i> overruled cases such as <i>In re Lee,</i> 277 F.3d
              1338, 61 USPQ2d 1430 (Fed. Cir. 2002), insofar as those cases require record evidence of
              an express reason to modify the prior art. As the Federal Circuit has
              explained:
            </p>
            <blockquote id="">
              <p id=""> At the time [of the decision in <i>In re Lee</i>], we
               required the PTO to identify record evidence of a teaching, suggestion, or motivation
               to combine references because “[o]mission of a relevant factor required by precedent
               is both legal error and arbitrary agency action.” However, this did not preclude
               examiners from employing common sense. More recently [in <i>DyStar Textilfarben
                 GmbH v. C.H. Patrick Co.,</i> 464 F.3d 1356, 1366 (Fed.Cir. 2006)], we
               explained that use of common sense does not require a “specific hint or suggestion in
               a particular reference,” only a reasoned explanation that avoids conclusory
               generalizations.

              and hence do not have the force and effect of law. They have been developed as a matter
              of internal Office management and are not intended to create any right or benefit,
              substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party against the Office. Rejections will
              continue to be based upon the substantive law, and it is these rejections that are
              appealable. Consequently, any failure by Office personnel to follow the guidelines is

                THE <i>KSR</i> DECISION AND PRINCIPLES OF THE
               LAW OF OBVIOUSNESS
              </h2>
              <p id="d0e208281"> The Supreme Court in <i>KSR</i> reaffirmed the familiar framework for determining obviousness as
               set forth in <i>Graham v. John Deere Co</i>., 383 U.S.
               1, 148 USPQ 459 (1966), but stated that the Federal Circuit had erred by applying the
               teaching-suggestion-motivation (TSM) test in an overly rigid and formalistic way.
               <i>KSR,</i> 550 U.S. at 404, 82 USPQ2d at 1391.
               Specifically, the Supreme Court stated that the Federal Circuit had erred in four
               ways: (1) “by holding that courts and patent examiners should look only to the
               problem the patentee was trying to solve ” <i>(Id.</i>
               at 420, 82 USPQ2d at 1397); (2) by assuming “that a person of ordinary skill
               attempting to solve a problem will be led only to those elements of prior art
               designed to solve the same problem” <i>(Id.);</i> (3) by
               concluding “that a patent claim cannot be proved obvious merely by showing that the
               combination of elements was ‘obvious to try’” <i>(Id.</i> at 421, USPQ2d at 1397); and (4) by overemphasizing “the risk of
               courts and patent examiners falling prey to hindsight bias” and as a result applying
               “[r]igid preventative rules that deny factfinders recourse to common sense” <i>(Id.)</i>. 
              </p>
              <p id="d0e208305"> In <i>KSR,</i> the Supreme
               Court particularly emphasized “the need for caution in granting a patent based on the
               combination of elements found in the prior art,”<i>Id.</i> at 415, 82 USPQ2d at 1395, and discussed circumstances in which a
               patent might be determined to be obvious. Importantly, the Supreme Court reaffirmed
               principles based on its precedent that “[t]he combination of familiar elements
               according to known methods is likely to be obvious when it does no more than yield
               predictable results.”<i>Id.</i> at 415-16, 82 USPQ2d at
               1395. The Supreme Court stated that there are “[t]hree cases decided after <i>Graham</i> [that] illustrate this doctrine.”
               <i>Id.</i> at 416, 82 USPQ2d at 1395. (1) “In <i>United States v. Adams,</i> . . . [t]he Court recognized
               that when a patent claims a structure already known in the prior art that is altered
               by the mere substitution of one element for another known in the field, the
               combination must do more than yield a predictable result.” <i>Id.</i> (2)
               “In <i>Anderson’s-Black Rock, Inc. v. Pavement Salvage
                 Co.,</i> . . . [t]he two [pre-existing elements] in combination did no more
               than they would in separate, sequential operation.” <i>Id.</i> at 416-17, 82 USPQ2d at 1395. (3) “[I]n <i>Sakraida v. AG Pro, Inc.,</i> the Court derived . . . the conclusion that
               when a patent simply arranges old elements with each performing the same function it
               had been known to perform and yields no more than one would expect from such an
               arrangement, the combination is obvious.” <i>Id.</i> at 417, 82 USPQ2d at
               1395-96 (Internal quotations omitted.). The principles underlining these cases are
               instructive when the question is whether a patent application claiming the
               combination of elements of prior art would have been obvious. The Supreme Court
               further stated that:
              </p>
              <blockquote id="d0e208332">
               <p id="d0e208333"> When a work is available in one field of endeavor,
                 design incentives and other market forces can prompt variations of it, either in
                 the same field or a different one. If a person of ordinary skill can implement a
                 predictable variation, <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1fbe1_19797_b0">§ 103</a></b> likely bars its
                 patentability. For the same reason, if a technique has been used to improve one
                 device, and a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that it would
                 improve similar devices in the same way, using the technique is obvious unless its
                 actual application is beyond his or her skill. <i>Id.</i> at 417, 82 USPQ2d at 1396.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p id="d0e208339"> When considering obviousness of a combination of known
               elements, the operative question is thus “whether the improvement is more than the
               predictable use of prior art elements according to their established functions.”
               <i>Id.</i></p>
              <p id="">The Supreme Court’s flexible approach to the obviousness inquiry is
               reflected in numerous pre-<i>KSR</i> decisions; see <b><a href="s2144.html#d0e210576">MPEP § 2144</a></b>. That
               section provides many lines of reasoning to support a determination of obviousness
               based upon earlier legal precedent that had condoned the use of particular examples
               of what may be considered common sense or ordinary routine practice (e.g., making
               integral, changes in shape, making adjustable). Thus, the type of reasoning
               sanctioned by the opinion in KSR has long been part of the patent examination
               process.

               459 (1966). Obviousness is a question of law based on underlying factual inquiries.
               The factual inquiries enunciated by the Court are as follows:

               considerations,” may include evidence of commercial success, long-felt but unsolved
               needs, failure of others, and unexpected results. The evidence may be included in the
               specification as filed, accompany the application on filing, or be provided in a
               timely manner at some other point during the prosecution. The weight to be given any
               objective evidence is made on a case-by-case basis. The mere fact that an applicant

              <p id="d0e208387">The question of obviousness must be resolved on the
               basis of the factual inquiries set forth above. While each case is different and must
               be decided on its own facts, the <i>Graham</i> factors,
               including secondary considerations when present, are the controlling inquiries in any
               obviousness analysis. The <i>Graham</i> factors were
               reaffirmed and relied upon by the Supreme Court in its consideration and
               determination of obviousness in the fact situation presented in <i>KSR,</i> 550 U.S. at 406-07, 82 USPQ2d at 1391 (2007). The
               Supreme Court has utilized the <i>Graham</i> factors in
               each of its obviousness decisions since <i>Graham.</i>

                 Co.,</i> 396 U.S. 57, 163 USPQ 673 (1969). As stated by the Supreme Court in
               <i>KSR,</i> “While the sequence of these questions
               might be reordered in any particular case, the [<i>Graham</i>] factors continue to define the inquiry that controls.”<i>KSR,</i> 550 U.S. at 407, 82 USPQ2d at 1391.

               <p id="d0e208430"> Office personnel fulfill the critical role of
                 factfinder when resolving the <i>Graham</i>
                 inquiries. It must be remembered that while the ultimate determination of
                 obviousness is a legal conclusion, the underlying <i>Graham</i> inquiries are factual. When making an obviousness rejection,
                 Office personnel must therefore ensure that the written record includes findings
                 of fact concerning the state of the art and the teachings of the references

              applied, but includes the understanding of one of ordinary skill in the art. The prior

              motivation to make the claimed invention nor the problem the inventor is solving
              controls. The proper analysis is whether the claimed invention would have been obvious

              other than the disclosures of the cited prior art may provide a basis for concluding
              that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to bridge the gap.
              The rationales discussed below outline reasoning that may be applied to find obviousness
              in such cases.

            <p id="d0e208637">If the search of the prior art and the resolution of the
              <i>Graham</i> factual inquiries reveal that an
              obviousness rejection may be made using the familiar teaching-suggestion-motivation
              (TSM) rationale, then such a rejection should be made. Although the Supreme Court in
              <i>KSR</i> cautioned against an overly rigid application
              of TSM, it also recognized that TSM was one of a number of valid rationales that could
              be used to determine obviousness. (According to the Supreme Court, establishment of the
              TSM approach to the question of obviousness “captured a helpful insight.” 550 U.S. at
              418, 82 USPQ2d at 1396 (citing <i>In re Bergel,</i> 292
              F.2d 955, 956-57, 130 USPQ 206, 207-208 (1961)). Furthermore, the Court explained that
              “[t]here is no necessary inconsistency between the idea underlying the TSM test and the
              <i>Graham</i> analysis.” 550 U.S. at 419, 82 USPQ2d at

              consider whether one or more of the other rationales set forth below support a
              conclusion of obviousness. The Court in <i>KSR</i> identified a number of
              rationales to support a conclusion of obviousness which are consistent with the proper

              invention would have been obvious, the burden then shifts to the applicant to (A) show
              that the Office erred in these findings or (B) provide other evidence to show that the

              requires applicant to distinctly and specifically point out the supposed errors in the
              Office’s action and reply to every ground of objection and rejection in the Office
              action. The reply must present arguments pointing out the specific distinction believed

              must include a reasoned statement explaining why the applicant believes the Office has
              erred substantively as to the factual findings. A mere statement or argument that the
              Office has not established a <i>prima facie</i> case of
              obviousness or that the Office’s reliance on common knowledge is unsupported by

            <p id="d0e208754"> Office personnel should consider all rebuttal evidence
              that is timely presented by the applicants when reevaluating any obviousness
              determination. Rebuttal evidence may include evidence of “secondary considerations,”
              such as “commercial success, long felt but unsolved needs, [and] failure of others”
              <i>(Graham v. John Deere Co.,</i> 383 U.S. at 17, 148
              USPQ at 467), and may also include evidence of unexpected results. As set forth above,
              Office personnel must articulate findings of fact that support the rationale relied upon
              in an obviousness rejection. As a result, applicants are likely to submit evidence to
              rebut the fact finding made by Office personnel. For example, in the case of a claim to
              a combination, applicants may submit evidence or argument to demonstrate that:

                 combined the claimed elements by known methods (e.g., due to technological
                 difficulties);

            <p id="d0e208774"> Once the applicant has presented rebuttal evidence, Office
              personnel should reconsider any initial obviousness determination in view of the entire
              record. See, e.g., <i>In re Piasecki,</i> 745 F.2d 1468,
              1472, 223 USPQ 785, 788 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <i>In re Eli Lilly

              rejections of record and proposed rejections and their bases should be reviewed to
              confirm their continued viability. The Office action should clearly communicate the
              Office’s findings and conclusions, articulating how the conclusions are supported by the

                 966 F.2d 656,658, 23 USPQ2 1058, 1061 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). A recent decision from
                 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, <i>In re Klein,</i>
                 647 F.3d 1343, 98 USPQ2d 1991 (Fed. Cir. 2011), is instructive as to the
                 "reasonably pertinent" prong for determining whether a reference is analogous art.
                 In determining whether a reference is reasonably pertinent, an examiner should
                 consider the problem faced by the inventor, as reflected - either explicitly or
                 implicitly - in the specification. In order to support a determination that a
                 reference is reasonably pertinent, it may be appropriate to include a statement of
                 the examiner's understanding of the problem. The question of whether a reference
                 is reasonably pertinent often turns on how the problem to be solved is perceived.
                 If the problem to be solved is viewed in a narrow or constrained way, and such a
                 view is not consistent with the specification, the scope of available prior art
                 may be inappropriately limited. It may be necessary for the examiner to explain
                 why an inventor seeking to solve the identified problem would have looked to the
                 reference in an attempt to find a solution to the problem, i.e., factual reasons
                 why the prior art is pertinent to the identified problem.

                 relied on nonanalogous art, should be fully considered in light of the
                 specification. In evaluating the applicant's argument, the examiner should look to
                 the teachings of the specification and the inferences that would reasonably have
                 been drawn from the specification by a person of ordinary skill in the art as a
                 guide to understanding the problem to be solved. A prior art reference not in the
                 same field of endeavor as the claimed invention must be reasonably pertinent to
                 the problem to be solved in order to qualify as analogous art and be applied in an
                 obviousness rejection.

               solutions to those problems;” (C) “rapidity with which innovations are made;” (D)
               “sophistication of the technology; and” (E) “educational level of active workers in

               in the art. For example, the document may be relevant to establishing "a motivation
               to combine which is implicit in the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art."
