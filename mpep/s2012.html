                        <p id="d0e196652">Clearly, where several patents or
                           applications stem from an original application which contained fraudulent claims
                           ultimately allowed, the doctrine of unclean hands bars allowance or enforcement of any
                           of the claims of any of the applications or patents. See <i>Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co.</i>, 290 U.S. 240, 245, 19 USPQ
                           228, 230 (1933); <i>East Chicago Machine Tool Corp. v. Stone

                           Supp. 859, 173 USPQ 295 (D.Del. 1972) and <i>Strong v. General
                              Electric Co.</i>, 305 F. Supp. 1084, 162 USPQ 141 (N.D. Ga. 1969), <i>aff’d</i>, 434 F.2d 1042, 168 USPQ 8 (5th Cir. 1970), <i>cert. denied</i>, 403 U.S. 906 (1971) where fraud or
                           inequitable conduct affecting only certain claims or only one of related patents was
                           held to affect the other claims or patent. Clearly, “fraud” practiced or attempted in an
                           application which issues as a patent is “fraud” practiced or attempted in connection
                           with any subsequent application to reissue that patent. The reissue application and the
                           patent are inseparable as far as questions of “fraud,” “inequitable conduct,” or
                           “violation of the duty of disclosure” are concerned. See <i>In re
                              Heany, supra; </i>and <i>Norton v. Curtiss</i>,
                           433&nbsp;F.2d 779, 792, 167 USPQ 532, 543 (CCPA 1970), wherein the court
                           stated:

                        <p id="d0e196686">Clearly, if a reissue patent would
                           not be enforceable after its issue because of “fraud,” “inequitable conduct” or
                           “violation of the duty of disclosure” during the prosecution of the patent sought to be
                           reissued, the reissue patent application should not issue. Where no investigation is
                           needed to establish such circumstances, an appropriate remedy would be to reject the
                           claims in the application in accordance with <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C. 251</a></b>. See

                           admission of fraud, inequitable conduct or violation of the duty of disclosure must be
                           explicit, unequivocal, and not subject to other interpretation. Where a rejection is
                           made based upon such an admission (see <b><a href="s1448.html#d0e141874">MPEP § 1448</a></b>) and
                           applicant responds with any reasonable interpretation of the facts that would not lead
                           to a conclusion of fraud, inequitable conduct or violation of the duty of disclosure,
                           the rejection should be withdrawn. Alternatively, if applicant shows that the admission
                           noted by the examiner was not in fact an admission, the rejection should also be
                           withdrawn.

                           litigation involving the patent, unless the patentee-plaintiff can demonstrate “that he

                           without any deceptive intention.” The Director is without authority to reissue a patent
                           when “deceptive intention” was present during prosecution of the parent application. See
                           <i>In re Clark</i>, 522 F.2d 62, 187 USPQ 209 (CCPA

                           Thus, the collateral estoppel barrier applies where reissue is sought of a patent which

                           in procuring of said patent. It was held in <i>In re
