                              1.804</a></b> specifies the time for making an original deposit to fulfill

                        discussed throughout this section, it is recommended that a deposit be made before the
                        filing date of the application. However, for the purposes of complying with the
                        requirements of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, a deposit of a
                        biological material may&nbsp;be made at any time before filing the application for patent or
                        during the pendency of the application subject to the conditions of <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333576">37 CFR

                        Allowance and Issue Fee Due is mailed. A necessary deposit need not be made by an applicant
                        until the application is in condition for allowance so long as the applicant provides a
                        written assurance that an acceptable deposit will be made on or before the payment of the
                        issue fee. This written assurance must provide sufficiently detailed information to
                        convince the examiner that there is no outstanding issue regarding deposits that needs to
                        be resolved.

                        the cases of international and national stage applications filed under the Patent

                        failure to make an original deposit in an application cannot be cured by filing a reissue
                        application or instituting a reexamination proceeding. However, if an amendment of claims
                        in a reexamination proceeding raises the need for a deposit, an original deposit may be
                        made during the reexamination proceeding.

                           for a specific identification is consistent with the description requirement of the

                           application as filed (now patent 4,594,325) provides a suitable illustration of the
                           specific identification and description which are required in an application as filed.
                           In that application, an immortal B-cell line was disclosed and claimed. The cell line
                           was referred to in the application, as filed, as WI-L2-729 HF2. The methods of obtaining
                           and using this cell line were also described in the application as filed. A deposit of
                           the cell line was made with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) about a week
                           after the application was filed in the United States. The United States Court of Appeals
                           for the Federal Circuit held that the requirements of access by the Office to a sample
                           of the cell line during pendency, and public access after grant, were met by Lundak's
                           procedures. The Court further held that the addition of information designating the
                           depository, accession number, and deposit date of the deposited cell line in ATCC after
                           the filing date did not violate the prohibition against new matter in <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303187">35&nbsp;U.S.C.

                           filed that the invention claimed and described in the specification “was fully capable
                           of being reduced to practice (i.e., no technological problems, the resolution of which
                           would require more than ordinary skill and reasonable time, remained in order to obtain
