                           very important that the practice under this section be carefully administered.
                           Notwithstanding the fact that this section of the statute apparently protects the

                        <p id="d0e98241">A Markush-type claim recites
                           alternatives in a format such as “selected from the group consisting of A, B and C.” See
                           <i>Ex parte Markush</i>, 1925 C.D. 126 (Comm’r Pat.
                           1925). The members of the Markush group (A, B, and C in the example above) ordinarily
                           must belong to a recognized physical or chemical class or to an art-recognized class.
                           However, when the Markush group occurs in a claim reciting a process or a combination
                           (not a single compound), it is sufficient if the members of the group are disclosed in
                           the specification to possess at least one property in common which is mainly responsible
                           for their function in the claimed relationship, and it is clear from their very nature
                           or from the prior art that all of them possess this property. Inventions in metallurgy,
                           refractories, ceramics, pharmacy, pharmacology and biology are most frequently claimed
                           under the Markush formula but purely mechanical features or process steps may also be
                           claimed by using the Markush style of claiming. See <b><a href="s2173.html#d0e218467">MPEP §
                                 2173.05(h)</a></b>.

                           are sufficiently few in number or so closely related that a search and examination of
                           the entire claim can be made without serious burden, the examiner must examine all the
                           members of the Markush group in the claim on the merits, even though they may be
                           directed to independent and distinct inventions. In such a case, the examiner will not
                           follow the procedure described below and will not require provisional election of a
                           single species. See MPEP § 808.02.

                           1978), it is improper for the Office to refuse to examine that which applicants regard
                           as their invention, unless the subject matter in a claim lacks unity of invention.
                           <i>In re Harnisch</i>, 631 F.2d 716, 206 USPQ 300 (CCPA

                           App. &amp; Int. 1984). Broadly, unity of invention exists where compounds included
                           within a Markush group (1) share a common utility, and (2) share a substantial
                           structural feature essential to that utility.

                           Markush-type generic claims which recite a plurality of alternatively usable substances
                           or members. In most cases, a recitation by enumeration is used because there is no
                           appropriate or true generic language. A Markush-type claim may include independent and
                           distinct inventions. This is true where two or more of the members are so unrelated and
                           diverse that a prior art reference anticipating the claim with respect to one of the
                           members would not render the claim obvious under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450">35 U.S.C. 103</a></b> with
                           respect to the other member(s). In applications containing a Markush-type claim that
                           encompasses at least two independent or distinct inventions, the examiner may require a
                           provisional election of a single species prior to examination on the merits. An examiner
                           should set forth a requirement for election of a single disclosed species in a
                           Markush-type claim using <b><a href="#fp8.01">form
                                 paragraph 8.01</a></b> when claims limited to species are

                           election, the Markush-type claim will be examined fully with respect to the elected
                           species and further to the extent necessary to determine patentability. If the
                           Markush-type claim is not allowable, the provisional election will be given effect and
                           examination will be limited to the Markush-type claim and claims to the elected species,
                           with claims drawn to species patentably distinct from the elected species held withdrawn
                           from further consideration.

                        <p id="d0e98292">As an example, in the case of an
                           application with a Markush-type claim drawn to the compound X-R, wherein R is a radical
                           selected from the group consisting of A, B, C, D, and E, the examiner may require a
                           provisional election of a single species, XA, XB, XC, XD, or XE. The Markush-type claim
                           would then be examined fully with respect to the elected species and any species
                           considered to be clearly unpatentable over the elected species. If on examination the
                           elected species is found to be anticipated or rendered obvious by prior art, the
                           Markush-type claim and claims to the elected species shall be rejected, and claims to
                           the nonelected species would be held withdrawn from further consideration. A second
