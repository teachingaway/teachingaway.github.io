                           rights to the property. In <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e336097">37 CFR 3.1</a></b>, assignment of <span class="Underline">patent rights</span> is defined as “a transfer by a party of all
                           or part of its right, title and interest in a patent [or] patent application....” An
                           assignment of a patent, or patent application, is the transfer to another of a party’s
                           <b id="d0e17804">entire</b> ownership interest or a percentage of that
                           party’s ownership interest in the patent or application. In order for an assignment to
                           take place, the transfer to another must include the entirety of the bundle of rights
                           that is associated with the ownership interest, i.e., all of the bundle of rights that
                           are inherent in the right, title and interest in the patent or patent application.

                           area, or field of use. A patent license is, in effect, a contractual agreement that the
                           patent owner will not sue the licensee for patent infringement if the licensee makes,
                           uses, offers for sale, sells, or imports the claimed invention, as long as the licensee
