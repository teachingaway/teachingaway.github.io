                           				international application and not the dependent claims. By “dependent” claim is
                           				meant a claim which contains all the features of one or more other claims and
                           				contains a reference, preferably at the beginning, to the other claim or claims and
                           				then states the additional features claimed (PCT Rule <b><a href="mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e366588">6.4</a></b> ). The examiner should bear in mind that a claim may
                           				also contain a reference to another claim even if it is not a dependent claim as
                           				defined in PCT Rule <b><a href="mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e366588">6.4</a></b> . One example of this is a
                           				claim referring to a claim of a different category (for example, “Apparatus for
                           				carrying out the process of Claim 1 ...,” or “Process for the manufacture of the
                           				product of Claim 1 ...”). Similarly, a claim to one part referring to another
                           				cooperating part, for example, “plug for cooperation with the socket of Claim 1
                           				...”) is not a dependent claim. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e175583"> If the independent claims avoid
                           				the prior art and satisfy the requirement of unity of invention, no problem of lack
                           				of unity arises in respect of any claims that depend on the independent claims. In
                           				particular, it does not matter if a dependent claim itself contains a further
                           				invention. For example, suppose claim 1 claims a turbine rotor blade shaped in a
                           				specified manner such that it avoids the prior art, while claim 2 is for a “turbine
                           				rotor blade as claimed in claim 1” and produced from alloy Z. Then no objection
                           				under PCT Rule <b><a href="mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e367565">13</a></b> arises either because alloy
                           				Z was new and its composition was not obvious and thus the alloy itself already
                           				contains the essential features of an independent possibly later patentable
                           				invention, or because, although alloy Z was not new, its application in respect of
                           				turbine rotor blades was not obvious, and thus represents an independent invention
                           				in conjunction with turbine rotor blades. As another example, suppose that the main
                           				claim defines a process avoiding the prior art for the preparation of a product A
                           				starting from a product B and the second claim reads: “Process according to claim 1
                           				characterized by producing B by a reaction using the product C.” In this case, too,
                           				no objection arises under PCT Rule <b><a href="mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e367565">13</a></b> , whether
                           				or not the process for preparation of B from C is novel and inventive, since claim 2
                           				contains all the features of claim 1. Equally, no problem arises in the case of a
                           				genus/species situation where the genus claim avoids the prior art, provided the
                           				genus claim is directed only to alternatives of a similar nature and the species
                           				falls entirely within the genus. To determine if a genus claim is directed only to
                           				alternatives “of a similar nature,” see subsection III.B. below. Moreover, no
                           				problem arises in the case of a combination/subcombination situation where the
                           				subcombination claim avoids the prior art and the combination claim includes all the
                           				features of the subcombination.

                           				claim does not avoid the prior art, then the question whether there is still an
                           				inventive link between all the claims dependent on that claim needs to be carefully
                           				considered. If there is no link remaining, an objection of lack of unity <i>a posteriori</i> (that is, arising only after assessment
                           				of the prior art) may be raised. Similar considerations apply in the case of a

                           				in deciding whether there is unity of invention. Accordingly, lack of unity of

                           				search effort is required, reasons of economy <i>may</i> make it advisable for the examiner, while making the search for
                           				the main invention, to search at the same time, despite the nonpayment of additional
                           				fees, one or more additional inventions in the classification units consulted for
                           				the main invention. The international search for such additional inventions will
                           				then have to be completed in any further classification units which may be relevant,
                           				when the additional search fees have been paid. This situation may occur when the
                           				lack of unity of invention is found either “ <i>a
                              					priori</i> ” or “ <i>a posteriori</i> .”

                        <p id="d0e175805">When the examiner finds lack of
                           				unity of invention, normally, the applicant is invited to pay fees for the search of
                           				additional inventions. In exceptional circumstances, however, the examiner may be
                           				able to establish both an international search (and for international applications
                           				having a filing date on or after January 1, 2004, a written opinion) covering more
                           				than one invention with negligible additional work, in particular, when the
                           				inventions are conceptually very close. In those cases, the examiner may decide to
                           				complete the international search (and where applicable, the written opinion of the
                           				International Searching Authority) for the additional invention(s) together with
                           				that for the invention first mentioned. For international applications having a
                           				filing date on or after January 1, 2004, in considering the amount of work involved,
                           				the examiner should take into account the time needed to create the written opinion
                           				as well as that needed to perform the search, since even when the additional work
                           				with regard to the search is negligible, the opposite may be the case for the
                           				written opinion of the International Searching Authority and therefore justify
                           				requesting the additional fees. If it is considered that the total additional work
                           				does not justify requesting additional fees, all results are included in the
                           				international search report (and where applicable, the written opinion) without
                           				inviting the applicant to pay an additional search fee in respect of the additional
                           				inventions searched but stating the finding of lack of unity of
                           				invention.

                              features” shall mean those technical features that define a contribution which each of the claimed inventions, considered
                              as a whole, makes over the prior art.
