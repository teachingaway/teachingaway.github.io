                           1321, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2005) expressly recognized that the USPTO employs the “broadest

                           but upon giving claims their broadest reasonable construction “in light of the

                           opportunity to amend the claims during prosecution, giving a claim its broadest
                           reasonable interpretation will reduce the possibility that the claim, once issued, will

                           was anticipated by a mental process augmented by pencil and paper markings. The court
                           agreed that the claim was not limited to using a machine to carry out the process since
                           the claim did not explicitly set forth the machine. The court explained that “reading a
                           claim in light of the specification, to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited
                           in the claim, is a quite different thing from ‘reading limitations of the specification
                           into a claim,’ to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed
                           limitations which have no express basis in the claim.” The court found that applicant
                           was advocating the latter, i.e., the impermissible importation of subject matter from
                           the specification into the claim.). See also <i>In re

                           (The court held that the PTO is not required, in the course of prosecution, to interpret
                           claims in applications in the same manner as a court would interpret claims in an
                           infringement suit. Rather, the “PTO applies to verbiage of the proposed claims the
                           broadest reasonable meaning of the words in their ordinary usage as they would be
                           understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, taking into account whatever
                           enlightenment by way of definitions or otherwise that may be afforded by the written

                           <i>In re Cortright,</i> 165 F.3d 1353, 1359, 49 USPQ2d
                           1464, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (The Board’s construction of the claim limitation “restore
                           hair growth” as requiring the hair to be returned to its original state was held to be
                           an incorrect interpretation of the limitation. The court held that, consistent with
                           applicant’s disclosure and the disclosure of three patents from analogous arts using the
                           same phrase to require only some increase in hair growth, one of ordinary skill would
                           construe “restore hair growth” to mean that the claimed method increases the amount of
                           hair grown on the scalp, but does not necessarily produce a full head of hair.). Thus
                           the focus of the inquiry regarding the meaning of a claim should be what would be
                           reasonable from the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art.<i> In re

                           In <i>Buszard,</i> the claim was directed to a flame retardant composition
                           comprising a flexible polyurethane foam reaction mixture. 504 F.3d at 1365, 84 USPQ2d at
                           1750. The Federal Circuit found that the Board’s interpretation that equated a
                           “flexible” foam with a crushed “rigid” foam was not reasonable.<i>Id.</i> at
                           1367, 84 USPQ2d at 1751. Persuasive argument was presented that persons experienced in
                           the field of polyurethane foams know that a flexible mixture is different than a rigid
                           foam mixture. <i>Id.</i> at 1366, 84 USPQ2d at 1751.

                           <p id="ch2100_d1b0d7_253bb_371">Under a broadest reasonable
                              interpretation, words of the claim must be given their plain meaning, unless such
                              meaning is inconsistent with the specification. The plain meaning of a term means the
                              ordinary and customary meaning given to the term by those of ordinary skill in the
                              art at the time of the invention. The ordinary and customary meaning of a term may be
                              evidenced by a variety of sources, including the words of the claims themselves, the
                              specification, drawings, and prior art. However, the best source for determining the
                              meaning of a claim term is the specification - the greatest clarity is obtained when
                              the specification serves as a glossary for the claim terms. The presumption that a
                              term is given its ordinary and customary meaning may be rebutted by the applicant by
                              clearly setting forth a different definition of the term in the specification.

                              language, the scope of the claims is more easily determined and the public notice
                              function of the claims is best served.

                              deficiency of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> or folic acid,
                              involving (i) assaying a body fluid for an “elevated level” of homocysteine, and (ii)
                              “correlating” an “elevated” level with a vitamin deficiency. <i>Id.</i>
                              at 1358-59, 71 USPQ2d at 1084. The court stated that the disputed claim term
                              “correlating” can include comparing with either an unelevated level or elevated
                              level, as opposed to only an elevated level because adding the “correlating” step in
                              the claim during prosecution to overcome prior art tied the preamble directly to the
                              “correlating” step. <i>Id.</i> at 1362, 71 USPQ2d at 1087. The recitation
                              of the intended use of “detecting” a vitamin deficiency in the preamble rendered the
                              claimed invention a method for “detecting,” and, thus, was not limited to detecting
                              “elevated” levels. <i>Id.</i></p>

                                 indicia on a measuring cup perform the function of indicating volume within that

                                 (Bd. App. 1955), in which the invention was directed to a set of dice by means of

                                 printed matter in the dice. The claims were properly rejected on prior art because
                                 there was no new feature of physical structure and no new relation of printed
                                 matter to physical structure. These situations may arise where the claim as a
                                 whole is directed towards conveying a message or meaning to a human reader
                                 independent of the supporting product. For example, a claimed measuring tape
                                 having electrical wiring information thereon, or a generically claimed substrate
                                 having a picture of a golf ball thereupon, would lack a functional relationship as
                                 the claims as a whole are directed towards conveying wiring information (unrelated

                                 substrate) to the reader. Additionally, where the printed matter and product do
                                 not depend upon each other, no functional relationship exists. For example, in a
                                 kit containing a set of chemicals and a printed set of instructions for using the
                                 chemicals, the instructions are not related to that particular set of

                           <p id="ch2100_d1b148_1fefb_26">When determining the scope of a claim
                              directed to a computer-readable medium containing certain programming, the examiner
                              should first look to the relationship between the programming and the intended
                              computer system. Where the programming performs some function with respect to the
                              computer with which it is associated, a functional relationship will be found. For
                              instance, a claim to computer-readable medium programmed with attribute data objects
                              that perform the function of facilitating retrieval, addition, and removal of
                              information in the intended computer system, establishes a functional relationship
                              such that the claimed attribute data objects are given patentable weight. See
                              <i>Lowry,</i> 32 F.3d at 1583-84, 32 USPQ2d at 1035.
                           </p>
                           <p id="ch2100_d1b1a1_1d7ad_3dd">However, where the claim as a whole is
                              directed conveying a message or meaning to a human reader independent of the intended
                              computer system, and/or the computer-readable medium merely serves as a support for
                              information or data, no functional relationship exists. For example, a claim to a
                              memory stick containing tables of batting averages, or tracks of recorded music,
                              utilizes the intended computer system merely as a support for the information. Such
                              claims are directed toward conveying meaning to the human reader rather than towards
                              establishing a functional relationship between recorded data and the computer.
