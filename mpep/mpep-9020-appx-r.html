 Each piece of correspondence, except as provided in
 paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3), (e) and (f) of this section,
 filed in an application, patent file, or other proceeding
 in the Office which requires a person’s signature,
 must:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">

 <i>S-signature</i>. An
 S-signature is a signature inserted between forward slash
 marks, but not a handwritten signature as defined by § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313174">1.4(d)(1)</a>. An S-signature includes
 any signature made by electronic or mechanical means, and
 any other mode of making or applying a signature not

 application, patent, or a reexamination proceeding may be
 S-signature signed instead of being personally signed

 this paragraph (d)(2) of this section are as
 follows.

 <li id="d0e313278" >(i) The S-signature must consist only of letters, or
 Arabic numerals, or both, with appropriate spaces
 and commas, periods, apostrophes, or hyphens for
 punctuation, and the person signing the
 correspondence must insert his or her own
 S-signature with a first single forward slash mark
 before, and a second single forward slash mark

 otherwise the number character may not be used in an
 S-signature.

 <i>Forms</i>. The Office
 provides forms to the public to use in certain situations
 to assist in the filing of correspondence for a certain
 purpose and to meet certain requirements for patent
 applications and proceedings. Use of the forms for
 purposes for which they were not designed is prohibited.
 No changes to certification statements on the Office forms
 (
 <i>e.g.</i>, oath or
 declaration forms, terminal disclaimer forms, petition
 forms, and nonpublication request forms) may be made. The
 existing text of a form, other than a certification
 statement, may be modified, deleted, or added to, if all
 text identifying the form as an Office form is removed.
 The presentation to the Office (whether by signing,
 filing, submitting, or later advocating) of any Office
 form with text identifying the form as an Office form by a
 party, whether a practitioner or non-practitioner,
 constitutes a certification under §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e351236">11.18(b)</a> of this chapter that the

 location, the application number (consisting of the series code
 and the serial number; 
 <i>e.g.</i>, 07/123,456), or
 the serial number and filing date assigned to that application
 by the Patent and Trademark Office, or the international
 application number of the international application. Any
 correspondence not containing such identification will be
 returned to the sender where a return address is available. The
 returned correspondence will be accompanied with a cover letter
 which will indicate to the sender that if the returned
 correspondence is resubmitted to the Patent and Trademark Office
 within two weeks of the mail date on the cover letter, the
 original date of receipt of the correspondence will be
 considered by the Patent and Trademark Office as the date of
 receipt of the correspondence. Applicants may use either the

 procedure under §  <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">1.10</a> for
 resubmissions of returned correspondence if they desire to have
 the benefit of the date of deposit in the United States Postal
 Service. If the returned correspondence is not resubmitted
 within the two-week period, the date of receipt of the
 resubmission will be considered to be the date of receipt of the
 correspondence. The two-week period to resubmit the returned
 correspondence will not be extended. In addition to the
 application number, all letters directed to the Patent and
 Trademark Office concerning applications for patent should also
 state the name of the first listed inventor, the title of the
 invention, the date of filing the same, and, if known, the group
 art unit or other unit within the Patent and Trademark Office

 and Trademark Office upon payment of the fee for establishing a
 deposit account §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316474">1.21(b)(1)</a> ). A minimum deposit of $1,000
 is required for paying any fee due or in ordering any services
 offered by the Office. However, a minimum deposit of $300 may be
 paid to establish a restricted subscription deposit account used
 exclusively for subscription order of patent copies as issued.
 At the end of each month, a deposit account statement will be
 rendered. A remittance must be made promptly upon receipt of the
 statement to cover the value of items or services charged to the
 account and thus restore the account to its established normal
 deposit value. An amount sufficient to cover all fees, services,
 copies, etc., requested must always be on deposit. Charges to
 accounts with insufficient funds will not be accepted. A service
 charge (§  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316474">1.21(b)(2)</a> )

 required. A change of purpose after the payment of a fee, such
 as when a party desires to withdraw a patent filing for which
 the fee was paid, including an application, an appeal, or a
 request for an oral hearing, will not entitle a party to a
 refund of such fee. The Office will not refund amounts of
 twenty-five dollars or less unless a refund is specifically
 requested, and will not notify the payor of such amounts. If a
 party paying a fee or requesting a refund does not provide the
 banking information necessary for making refunds by electronic
 funds transfer (31 U.S.C. 3332 and 31 CFR part 208), or instruct
 the Office that refunds are to be credited to a deposit account,
 the Director may require such information, or use the banking
 information on the payment instrument to make a refund. Any
 refund of a fee paid by credit card will be by a credit to the
 credit card account to which the fee was
 charged.

 process the deficiency payment and charge the processing

 status under paragraph (i) of this section, but payment of
 a deficiency based upon the difference between the current
 fee amount for a small entity and the amount of the
 previous erroneous micro entity fee payment will not be
 treated as an assertion of small entity status under § <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">1.27(c)</a>. Once a

 may treat the mailing address of the first named inventor (if

 The Office will generally not engage in double correspondence
 with an applicant and a patent practitioner, or with more than
 one patent practitioner except as deemed necessary by the
 Director. If more than one correspondence address is specified
 in a single document, the Office will select one of the
 specified addresses for use as the correspondence address and,

 should follow the number. Nontext elements (
 <i>e.g.</i>, tables, mathematical
 or chemical formulae, chemical structures, and sequence
 data) are considered part of the numbered paragraph around
 or above the elements, and should not be independently
 numbered. If a nontext element extends to the left margin,
 it should not be numbered as a separate and independent
 paragraph. A list is also treated as part of the paragraph
 around or above the list, and should not be independently
 numbered. Paragraph or section headers (titles), whether
 abutting the left margin or centered on the page, are not
 considered paragraphs and should not be numbered.

 nonprovisional application under this paragraph will
 result in the term of any patent to issue from the

 by its very nature is affected with a public interest. The
 public interest is best served, and the most effective patent
 examination occurs when, at the time an application is being
 examined, the Office is aware of and evaluates the teachings of
 all information material to patentability. Each individual
 associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent
 application has a duty of candor and good faith in dealing with
 the Office, which includes a duty to disclose to the Office all
 information known to that individual to be material to
 patentability as defined in this section. The duty to disclose
 information exists with respect to each pending claim until the
 claim is cancelled or withdrawn from consideration, or the
 application becomes abandoned. Information material to the
 patentability of a claim that is cancelled or withdrawn from
 consideration need not be submitted if the information is not
 material to the patentability of any claim remaining under
 consideration in the application. There is no duty to submit
 information which is not material to the patentability of any
 existing claim. The duty to disclose all information known to be
 material to patentability is deemed to be satisfied if all
 information known to be material to patentability of any claim
 issued in a patent was cited by the Office or submitted to the
 Office in the manner prescribed by §§  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e321609">1.97(b)</a> - <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">(d)</a> and  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e321738">1.98</a>.

 features disclosed in the description and claims, where their
 detailed illustration is not essential for a proper
 understanding of the invention, should be illustrated in the
 drawing in the form of a graphical drawing symbol or a labeled
 representation (
 <i>e.g.</i>, a

 Standards for drawings.
 </h1>
 <div id="d0e321006" class="List">
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e321007" >(a) 
 <i>Drawings</i>. There are two
 acceptable categories for presenting drawings in utility and
 design patent applications.
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e321013" >(1) 
 <i>Black ink</i>. Black and
 white drawings are normally required. India ink, or its
 equivalent that secures solid black lines, must be used
 for drawings; or
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321019" >(2) 
 <i>Color.</i> On rare
 occasions, color drawings may be necessary as the only
 practical medium by which to disclose the subject matter
 sought to be patented in a utility or design patent
 application. The color drawings must be of sufficient
 quality such that all details in the drawings are
 reproducible in black and white in the printed patent.
 Color drawings are not permitted in international
 applications (see  <a href="mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e367144">PCT Rule
 11.13
 </a> ), or in an application, or
 copy thereof, submitted under the Office electronic filing
 system. The Office will accept color drawings in utility
 or design patent applications only after granting a
 petition filed under this paragraph explaining why the
 color drawings are necessary. Any such petition must
 include the following:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e321028" >(i) The fee set forth in § 
 <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#d0e315199">1.17(h)</a> ;
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321035" >(ii) Three (3) sets of color drawings;</li>
 <li id="d0e321039" >(iii) An amendment to the specification to insert (unless
 the specification contains or has been previously
 amended to contain) the following language as the
 first paragraph of the brief description of the
 drawings:
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p id="d0e321043" class="quotetext"> The patent or application file
 contains at least one drawing executed in color. Copies of this
 patent or patent application publication with color drawing(s)
 will be provided by the Office upon request and payment of the
 necessary fee.
 </p>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321046" >(b) 
 <i>Photographs</i>.— 
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e321052" >(1) 
 <i>Black and white</i>.
 Photographs, including photocopies of photographs, are not
 ordinarily permitted in utility and design patent
 applications. The Office will accept photographs in
 utility and design patent applications, however, if
 photographs are the only practicable medium for
 illustrating the claimed invention. For example,
 photographs or photomicrographs of: electrophoresis gels,
 blots (
 <i>e.g.</i>,
 immunological, western, Southern, and northern), auto-
 radiographs, cell cultures (stained and unstained),
 histological tissue cross sections (stained and
 unstained), animals, plants, in vivo imaging, thin layer
 chromatography plates, crystalline structures, and, in a
 design patent application, ornamental effects, are
 acceptable. If the subject matter of the application
 admits of illustration by a drawing, the examiner may
 require a drawing in place of the photograph. The
 photographs must be of sufficient quality so that all
 details in the photographs are reproducible in the printed
 patent.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321061" >(2) 
 <i>Color photographs</i>.
 Color photographs will be accepted in utility and design
 patent applications if the conditions for accepting color
 drawings and black and white photographs have been
 satisfied. See paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(1) of this
 section.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321067" >(c) 
 <i>Identification of drawings</i>.
 Identifying indicia should be provided, and if provided, should
 include the title of the invention, inventor’s name, and
 application number, or docket number (if any) if an application
 number has not been assigned to the application. If this
 information is provided, it must be placed on the front of each
 sheet within the top margin. Each drawing sheet submitted after
 the filing date of an application must be identified as either
 “Replacement Sheet” or “New Sheet” pursuant to § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323020"> 1.121(d)</a>.
 If a marked-up copy of any amended drawing figure including
 annotations indicating the changes made is filed, such marked-up
 copy must be clearly labeled as “Annotated Sheet” pursuant to § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323020">
 1.121(d)(1)
 </a>.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321079" >(d) 
 <i>Graphic forms in drawings</i>.
 Chemical or mathematical formulae, tables, and waveforms may be
 submitted as drawings and are subject to the same requirements
 as drawings. Each chemical or mathematical formula must be
 labeled as a separate figure, using brackets when necessary, to
 show that information is properly integrated. Each group of
 waveforms must be presented as a single figure, using a common
 vertical axis with time extending along the horizontal axis.
 Each individual waveform discussed in the specification must be
 identified with a separate letter designation adjacent to the
 vertical axis.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321085" >(e) 
 <i>Type of paper</i>. Drawings
 submitted to the Office must be made on paper which is flexible,
 strong, white, smooth, non-shiny, and durable. All sheets must
 be reasonably free from cracks, creases, and folds. Only one
 side of the sheet may be used for the drawing. Each sheet must
 be reasonably free from erasures and must be free from
 alterations, overwritings, and interlineations. Photographs must
 be developed on paper meeting the sheet-size requirements of
 paragraph (f) of this section and the margin requirements of
 paragraph (g) of this section. See paragraph (b) of this section
 for other requirements for photographs.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321091" >(f) 
 <i>Size of paper</i>. All drawing
 sheets in an application must be the same size. One of the
 shorter sides of the sheet is regarded as its top. The size of
 the sheets on which drawings are made must be:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e321097" >(1) 21.0
 cm. by 29.7 cm. (DIN size A4), or
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321101" >(2) 21.6
 cm. by 27.9 cm. (8 1/2 by 11 inches).
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321105" >(g) 
 <i>Margins</i>. The sheets must not
 contain frames around the sight (
 <i>i.e.</i>, the usable surface), but should have scan
 target points (
 <i>i.e.</i>,
 cross-hairs) printed on two cater-corner margin corners. Each
 sheet must include a top margin of at least 2.5 cm. (1 inch), a
 left side margin of at least 2.5 cm. (1 inch), a right side
 margin of at least 1.5 cm. (5/8 inch), and a bottom margin of at
 least 1.0 cm. (3/8 inch), thereby leaving a sight no greater
 than 17.0 cm. by 26.2 cm. on 21.0 cm. by 29.7 cm. (DIN size A4)
 drawing sheets, and a sight no greater than 17.6 cm. by 24.4 cm.
 (6 15/16 by 9 5/8 inches) on 21.6 cm. by 27.9 cm. (8 1/2 by
 11 inch) drawing sheets.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321117" >(h) 
 <i>Views</i>. The drawing must
 contain as many views as necessary to show the invention. The
 views may be plan, elevation, section, or perspective views.
 Detail views of portions of elements, on a larger scale if
 necessary, may also be used. All views of the drawing must be
 grouped together and arranged on the sheet(s) without wasting
 space, preferably in an upright position, clearly separated from
 one another, and must not be included in the sheets containing
 the specifications, claims, or abstract. Views must not be
 connected by projection lines and must not contain center lines.
 Waveforms of electrical signals may be connected by dashed lines
 to show the relative timing of the waveforms.
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e321123" >(1) 
 <i>Exploded views</i>.
 Exploded views, with the separated parts embraced by a
 bracket, to show the relationship or order of assembly of
 various parts are permissible. When an exploded view is
 shown in a figure which is on the same sheet as another
 figure, the exploded view should be placed in
 brackets.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321129" >(2) 
 <i>Partial views</i>. When
 necessary, a view of a large machine or device in its
 entirety may be broken into partial views on a single
 sheet, or extended over several sheets if there is no loss
 in facility of understanding the view. Partial views drawn
 on separate sheets must always be capable of being linked
 edge to edge so that no partial view contains parts of
 another partial view. A smaller scale view should be
 included showing the whole formed by the partial views and
 indicating the positions of the parts shown. When a
 portion of a view is enlarged for magnification purposes,
 the view and the enlarged view must each be labeled as
 separate views.
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e321135" >(i) Where views on two or more sheets form, in effect,
 a single complete view, the views on the several
 sheets must be so arranged that the complete figure
 can be assembled without concealing any part of any
 of the views appearing on the various
 sheets.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321139" >(ii) A very long view may be divided into several parts
 placed one above the other on a single sheet.
 However, the relationship between the different
 parts must be clear and unambiguous.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321143" >(3) 
 <i>Sectional views</i>. The
 plane upon which a sectional view is taken should be
 indicated on the view from which the section is cut by a
 broken line. The ends of the broken line should be
 designated by Arabic or Roman numerals corresponding to
 the view number of the sectional view, and should have
 arrows to indicate the direction of sight. Hatching must
 be used to indicate section portions of an object, and
 must be made by regularly spaced oblique parallel lines
 spaced sufficiently apart to enable the lines to be
 distinguished without difficulty. Hatching should not
 impede the clear reading of the reference characters and
 lead lines. If it is not possible to place reference
 characters outside the hatched area, the hatching may be
 broken off wherever reference characters are inserted.
 Hatching must be at a substantial angle to the surrounding
 axes or principal lines, preferably 45°. A cross section
 must be set out and drawn to show all of the materials as
 they are shown in the view from which the cross section
 was taken. The parts in cross section must show proper
 material(s) by hatching with regularly spaced parallel
 oblique strokes, the space between strokes being chosen on
 the basis of the total area to be hatched. The various
 parts of a cross section of the same item should be
 hatched in the same manner and should accurately and
 graphically indicate the nature of the material(s) that is
 illustrated in cross section. The hatching of juxtaposed
 different elements must be angled in a different way. In
 the case of large areas, hatching may be confined to an
 edging drawn around the entire inside of the outline of
 the area to be hatched. Different types of hatching should
 have different conventional meanings as regards the nature
 of a material seen in cross section.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321149" >(4) 
 <i>Alternate position</i>. A
 moved position may be shown by a broken line superimposed
 upon a suitable view if this can be done without crowding;
 otherwise, a separate view must be used for this
 purpose.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321155" >(5) 
 <i>Modified forms</i>.
 Modified forms of construction must be shown in separate
 views.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321161" >(i) 
 <i>Arrangement of views</i>
 <b id="d0e321165">. One view must not be placed upon
 another or within the outline of another. All views on the same
 sheet should stand in the same direction and, if possible, stand
 so that they can be read with the sheet held in an upright
 position. If views wider than the width of the sheet are
 necessary for the clearest illustration of the invention, the
 sheet may be turned on its side so that the top of the sheet,
 with the appropriate top margin to be used as the heading space,
 is on the right-hand side. Words must appear in a horizontal,
 left-to-right fashion when the page is either upright or turned
 so that the top becomes the right side, except for graphs
 utilizing standard scientific convention to denote the axis of
 abscissas (of X) and the axis of ordinates (of
 Y).
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321169" >(j) 
 <i>Front page view</i>. The drawing
 must contain as many views as necessary to show the invention.
 One of the views should be suitable for inclusion on the front
 page of the patent application publication and patent as the
 illustration of the invention. Views must not be connected by
 projection lines and must not contain center lines. Applicant
 may suggest a single view (by figure number) for inclusion on
 the front page of the patent application publication and
 patent.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321175" >(k) 
 <i>Scale</i>. The scale to which a
 drawing is made must be large enough to show the mechanism
 without crowding when the drawing is reduced in size to
 two-thirds in reproduction. Indications such as “actual size” or
 “scale 1/2” on the drawings are not permitted since these lose
 their meaning with reproduction in a different
 format.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321181" >(l) 
 <i>Character of lines, numbers, and
 letters.
 </i> All drawings must be made by a process
 which will give them satisfactory reproduction characteristics.
 Every line, number, and letter must be durable, clean, black
 (except for color drawings), sufficiently dense and dark, and
 uniformly thick and well-defined. The weight of all lines and
 letters must be heavy enough to permit adequate reproduction.
 This requirement applies to all lines however fine, to shading,
 and to lines representing cut surfaces in sectional views. Lines
 and strokes of different thicknesses may be used in the same
 drawing where different thicknesses have a different
 meaning.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321187" >(m) 
 <i>Shading</i>. The use of shading
 in views is encouraged if it aids in understanding the invention
 and if it does not reduce legibility. Shading is used to
 indicate the surface or shape of spherical, cylindrical, and
 conical elements of an object. Flat parts may also be lightly
 shaded. Such shading is preferred in the case of parts shown in
 perspective, but not for cross sections. See paragraph (h)(3) of
 this section. Spaced lines for shading are preferred. These
 lines must be thin, as few in number as practicable, and they
 must contrast with the rest of the drawings. As a substitute for
 shading, heavy lines on the shade side of objects can be used
 except where they superimpose on each other or obscure reference
 characters. Light should come from the upper left corner at an
 angle of 45°. Surface delineations should preferably be shown by
 proper shading. Solid black shading areas are not permitted,
 except when used to represent bar graphs or
 color.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321193" >(n) 
 <i>Symbols</i>. Graphical drawing
 symbols may be used for conventional elements when appropriate.
 The elements for which such symbols and labeled representations
 are used must be adequately identified in the specification.
 Known devices should be illustrated by symbols which have a
 universally recognized conventional meaning and are generally
 accepted in the art. Other symbols which are not universally
 recognized may be used, subject to approval by the Office, if
 they are not likely to be confused with existing conventional
 symbols, and if they are readily identifiable.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321199" >(o) 
 <i>Legends</i>. Suitable
 descriptive legends may be used subject to approval by the
 Office, or may be required by the examiner where necessary for
 understanding of the drawing. They should contain as few words
 as possible.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321205" >(p) 
 <i>Numbers, letters, and reference
 characters.
 </i>
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e321210" >(1) Reference characters (numerals are preferred), sheet
 numbers, and view numbers must be plain and legible, and
 must not be used in association with brackets or inverted
 commas, or enclosed within outlines, 
 <i>e.g</i>., encircled. They must
 be oriented in the same direction as the view so as to
 avoid having to rotate the sheet. Reference characters
 should be arranged to follow the profile of the object
 depicted.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321217" >(2) The
 English alphabet must be used for letters, except where
 another alphabet is customarily used, such as the Greek
 alphabet to indicate angles, wavelengths, and mathematical
 formulas.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321221" >(3) Numbers, letters, and reference characters must measure
 at least .32 cm. (1/8 inch) in height. They should not be
 placed in the drawing so as to interfere with its
 comprehension. Therefore, they should not cross or mingle
 with the lines. They should not be placed upon hatched or
 shaded surfaces. When necessary, such as indicating a
 surface or cross section, a reference character may be
 underlined and a blank space may be left in the hatching
 or shading where the character occurs so that it appears
 distinct.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321225" >(4) The
 same part of an invention appearing in more than one view
 of the drawing must always be designated by the same
 reference character, and the same reference character must
 never be used to designate different
 parts.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321229" >(5) Reference characters not mentioned in the description
 shall not appear in the drawings. Reference characters
 mentioned in the description must appear in the
 drawings.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321233" >(q) 
 <i>Lead lines</i>. Lead lines are
 those lines between the reference characters and the details
 referred to. Such lines may be straight or curved and should be
 as short as possible. They must originate in the immediate
 proximity of the reference character and extend to the feature
 indicated. Lead lines must not cross each other. Lead lines are
 required for each reference character except for those which
 indicate the surface or cross section on which they are placed.
 Such a reference character must be underlined to make it clear
 that a lead line has not been left out by mistake. Lead lines
 must be executed in the same way as lines in the drawing. See
 paragraph (l) of this section.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321239" >(r) 
 <i>Arrows</i>. Arrows may be used
 at the ends of lines, provided that their meaning is clear, as
 follows:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e321245" >(1) On a
 lead line, a freestanding arrow to indicate the entire
 section towards which it points;
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321249" >(2) On a
 lead line, an arrow touching a line to indicate the
 surface shown by the line looking along the direction of
 the arrow; or
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321253" >(3) To
 show the direction of movement.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321257" >(s) 
 <i>Copyright or Mask Work
 Notice
 </i>. A copyright or mask work notice may appear
 in the drawing, but must be placed within the sight of the
 drawing immediately below the figure representing the copyright
 or mask work material and be limited to letters having a print
 size of .32 cm. to .64 cm. (1/8 to 1/4 inches) high. The content
 of the notice must be limited to only those elements provided
 for by law. For example, “©1983 John Doe” (17 U.S.C. 401) and
 “*M* John Doe” (17 U.S.C. 909) would be properly limited and,
 under current statutes, legally sufficient notices of copyright
 and mask work, respectively. Inclusion of a copyright or mask
 work notice will be permitted only if the authorization language
 set forth in §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320131">1.71(e)</a> is included at the beginning
 (preferably as the first paragraph) of the
 specification.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321266" >(t) 
 <i>Numbering of sheets of
 drawings
 </i>. The sheets of drawings should be numbered
 in consecutive Arabic numerals, starting with 1, within the
 sight as defined in paragraph (g) of this section. These
 numbers, if present, must be placed in the middle of the top of
 the sheet, but not in the margin. The numbers can be placed on
 the right-hand side if the drawing extends too close to the
 middle of the top edge of the usable surface. The drawing sheet
 numbering must be clear and larger than the numbers used as
 reference characters to avoid confusion. The number of each
 sheet should be shown by two Arabic numerals placed on either
 side of an oblique line, with the first being the sheet number
 and the second being the total number of sheets of drawings,
 with no other marking.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321272" >(u) 
 <i>Numbering of views.</i>
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e321277" >(1) The
 different views must be numbered in consecutive Arabic
 numerals, starting with 1, independent of the numbering of
 the sheets and, if possible, in the order in which they
 appear on the drawing sheet(s). Partial views intended to
 form one complete view, on one or several sheets, must be
 identified by the same number followed by a capital
 letter. View numbers must be preceded by the abbreviation
 “FIG.” Where only a single view is used in an application
 to illustrate the claimed invention, it must not be
 numbered and the abbreviation “FIG.” must not
 appear.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321281" >(2) Numbers and letters identifying the views must be simple
 and clear and must not be used in association with
 brackets, circles, or inverted commas. The view numbers
 must be larger than the numbers used for reference
 characters.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321285" >(v) 
 <i>Security markings</i>
 <b id="d0e321289">. Authorized security markings may
 be placed on the drawings provided they are outside the sight,
 preferably centered in the top margin.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321293" >(w) 
 <i>Corrections</i>. Any corrections
 on drawings submitted to the Office must be durable and
 permanent.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321299" >(x) 
 <i>Holes</i>. No holes should be
 made by applicant in the drawing sheets.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e321305" >(y) 
 <i>Types of drawings</i>. See § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324205">1.152</a> for
 design drawings, §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324521">1.165</a> for plant drawings, and § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324614">1.173(a)(2)</a> for reissue drawings.

 taking up an application for examination or a patent in a
 reexamination proceeding, the examiner shall make a
 thorough study thereof and shall make a thorough
 investigation of the available prior art relating to the
 subject matter of the claimed invention. The examination
 shall be complete with respect both to compliance of the
 application or patent under reexamination with the
 applicable statutes and rules and to the patentability of
 the invention as claimed, as well as with respect to
 matters of form, unless otherwise
 indicated.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e322142" >(2) The
 applicant, or in the case of a reexamination proceeding,
 both the patent owner and the requester, will be notified
 of the examiner’s action. The reasons for any adverse
 action or any objection or requirement will be stated in
 an Office action and such information or references will
 be given as may be useful in aiding the applicant, or in
 the case of a reexamination proceeding the patent owner,
 to judge the propriety of continuing the
 prosecution.

 rejecting claims for want of novelty or for obviousness,
 the examiner must cite the best references at his or her
 command. When a reference is complex or shows or describes
 inventions other than that claimed by the applicant, the
 particular part relied on must be designated as nearly as
 practicable. The pertinence of each reference, if not
 apparent, must be clearly explained and each rejected
 claim specified.

 on an application containing a generic claim to a generic invention
 (genus) and claims to more than one patentably distinct species embraced
 thereby, the examiner may require the applicant in the reply to that
 action to elect a species of his or her invention to which his or her
 claim will be restricted if no claim to the genus is found to be
 allowable. However, if such application contains claims directed to more
 than a reasonable number of species, the examiner may require restriction
 of the claims to not more than a reasonable number of species before
 taking further action in the application.

 a sufficient number of views to constitute a complete disclosure of the
 appearance of the design. Appropriate and adequate surface shading should
 be used to show the character or contour of the surfaces represented.
 Solid black surface shading is not permitted except when used to
 represent the color black as well as color contrast. Broken lines may be
 used to show visible environmental structure, but may not be used to show
 hidden planes and surfaces that cannot be seen through opaque materials.
 Alternate positions of a design component, illustrated by full and broken
 lines in the same view are not permitted in a design drawing. Photographs
 and ink drawings are not permitted to be combined as formal drawings in
 one application. Photographs submitted in lieu of ink drawings in design
 patent applications must not disclose environmental structure but must be
 limited to the design claimed for the article.

 <i>Specification, including
 claims.
 </i> The entire specification, including
 the claims, of the patent for which reissue is requested
 must be furnished in the form of a copy of the printed
 patent, in double column format, each page on only one
 side of a single sheet of paper. If an amendment of the
 reissue application is to be included, it must be made
 pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. The formal
 requirements for papers making up the reissue application
 other than those set forth in this section are set out in
 §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e318327">1.52</a>.

 markings pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, except
 that an entire paragraph may be deleted by a statement
 deleting the paragraph without presentation of the text of
 the paragraph. The precise point in the specification must

 changed by such amendment paper and of each claim being
 added by such amendment paper. For any claim changed by
 the amendment paper, a parenthetical expression “amended,”
 “twice amended,” 
 <i>etc.</i>,
 should follow the claim number. Each changed patent claim

 original version of the sheet, even if only one figure is
 amended. Amended figures must be identified as “Amended,”
 and any added figure must be identified as “New.” In the
 event that a figure is canceled, the figure must be
 surrounded by brackets and identified as “Canceled.” All
 changes to the drawing(s) shall be explained, in detail,
 beginning on a separate sheet accompanying the papers
 including the amendment to the drawings. 
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e324701" >(i) A marked-up copy of any amended drawing figure,

 also be supplied, on pages separate from the pages containing
 the changes, the status (

 amendment, of all patent claims and of all added claims, and an
 explanation of the support in the disclosure of the patent for
 the changes made to the claims.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e324718" >(d) 
 <i>Changes shown by markings</i>.
 Any changes relative to the patent being reissued which are made
 to the specification, including the claims, upon filing, or by
 an amendment paper in the reissue application, must include the
 following markings:

 on compact discs must be preceded with “&lt;U&gt;” and end
 with “&lt;/U&gt;” to properly identify the material being
 added.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e324738" >(e) 
 <i>Numbering of patent claims
 preserved.
 </i> Patent claims may not be renumbered. The
 numbering of any claim added in the reissue application must
 follow the number of the highest numbered patent
 claim.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e324744" >(f) 
 <i>Amendment of disclosure may be
 required

 the maintenance fee is being paid. If the payment includes
 identification of only the patent number (

 changed or claimed, the amount of the maintenance fee and any
 surcharge being paid, and any assigned customer number. If the

 reissue patent number and reissue application number as required
 by paragraph (c) of this section and should also include the
 original patent number.

 an authorization to charge a deposit account. If maintenance fee

 Examining Authority will determine whether the international
 application complies with the requirement of unity of invention
 as set forth in §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e328679">1.475</a>.

 International Preliminary Examining Authority considers that the
 international application does not comply with the requirement
 of unity of invention, it may:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e329078" >(1) Issue
 a written opinion and/or an international preliminary
 examination report, in respect of the entire international
 application and indicate that unity of invention is
 lacking and specify the reasons therefor without extending
 an invitation to restrict or pay additional fees. No
 international preliminary examination will be conducted on
 inventions not previously searched by an International
 Searching Authority.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e329082" >(2) Invite
 the applicant to restrict the claims or pay additional
 fees, pointing out the categories of invention found,
 within a set time limit which will not be extended. No
 international preliminary examination will be conducted on
 inventions not previously searched by an International
 Searching Authority, or
 </li>
 <li id="d0e329086" >(3) If
 applicant fails to restrict the claims or pay additional
 fees within the time limit set for reply, the
 International Preliminary Examining Authority will issue a
 written opinion and/or establish an international
 preliminary examination report on the main invention and
 shall indicate the relevant facts in the said report. In
 case of any doubt as to which invention is the main
 invention, the invention first mentioned in the claims and
 previously searched by an International Searching
 Authority shall be considered the main
 invention.

 unity of invention may be directly evident before considering
 the claims in relation to any prior art, or after taking the
 prior art into consideration, as where a document discovered
 during the search shows the invention claimed in a generic or
 linking claim lacks novelty or is clearly obvious, leaving two
 or more claims joined thereby without a common inventive
 concept. In such a case the International Preliminary Examining
 Authority may raise the objection of lack of unity of
 invention.

 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e330662" >(a) A patent by
 its very nature is affected with a public interest. The public
 interest is best served, and the most effective reexamination
 occurs when, at the time a reexamination proceeding is being
 conducted, the Office is aware of and evaluates the teachings of
 all information material to patentability in a reexamination
 proceeding. Each individual associated with the patent owner in
 a reexamination proceeding has a duty of candor and good faith
 in dealing with the Office, which includes a duty to disclose to
 the Office all information known to that individual to be
 material to patentability in a reexamination proceeding. The
 individuals who have a duty to disclose to the Office all
 information known to them to be material to patentability in a
 reexamination proceeding are the patent owner, each attorney or
 agent who represents the patent owner, and every other
 individual who is substantively involved on behalf of the patent
 owner in a reexamination proceeding. The duty to disclose the
 information exists with respect to each claim pending in the
 reexamination proceeding until the claim is cancelled.
 Information material to the patentability of a cancelled claim
 need not be submitted if the information is not material to
 patentability of any claim remaining under consideration in the
 reexamination proceeding. The duty to disclose all information
 known to be material to patentability in a reexamination
 proceeding is deemed to be satisfied if all information known to
 be material to patentability of any claim in the patent after
 issuance of the reexamination certificate was cited by the
 Office or submitted to the Office in an information disclosure
  statement. However, the duties of candor, good faith, and
 disclosure have not been complied with if any fraud on the
 Office was practiced or attempted or the duty of disclosure was
 violated through bad faith or intentional misconduct by, or on
 behalf of, the patent owner in the reexamination proceeding. Any
 information disclosure statement must be filed with the items
 listed in §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e321738">1.98(a)</a> as

 the time of the interview, or as a separate paper within one
 month from the date of the interview, whichever is
 later.

 information adverse to a determination of entitlement to the

 in the patent term extension proceeding must bring such
 information to the attention of the Office or the Secretary, as
 appropriate, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section,

 its agent for the patent term extension proceeding or through a
 patent owner acting on his or her own behalf. Disclosure to such

 determination of entitlement to the extension
 sought.

 </a>. Nucleotides
 and amino acids are further defined as follows:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e333674" >(1) 
 <i>Nucleotides:</i>
 Nucleotides are intended to embrace only those nucleotides
 that can be represented using the symbols set forth in
 WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, Table 1.
 Modifications, 
 <i>e.g.</i>,
 methylated bases, may be described as set forth in WIPO
 Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, Table 2, but shall not
 be shown explicitly in the nucleotide
 sequence.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e333683" >(2) 
 <i>Amino acids:</i> Amino
 acids are those L-amino acids commonly found in naturally
 occurring proteins and are listed in WIPO Standard ST.25
 (1998), Appendix 2, Table 3. Those amino acid sequences
 containing D-amino acids are not intended to be embraced
 by this definition. Any amino acid sequence that contains
 post-translationally modified amino acids may be described
 as the amino acid sequence that is initially translated
 using the symbols shown in WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998),
 Appendix 2, Table 3 with the modified positions; 
 <i>e.g.</i>, hydroxylations or
 glycosylations, being described as set forth in WIPO
 Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, Table 4, but these
 modifications shall not be shown explicitly in the amino
 acid sequence. Any peptide or protein that can be
 expressed as a sequence using the symbols in WIPO Standard
 ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, Table 3 in conjunction with a
 description in the Feature section to describe, for
 example, modified linkages, cross links and end caps,
 non-peptidyl bonds, etc., is embraced by this
 definition.

 definition in paragraph (a) of this section, shall, with
 regard to the manner in which the nucleotide and/or amino
 acid sequences are presented and described, conform
 exclusively to the requirements of §§  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333653">1.821</a> through  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e334511">1.825</a>.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e333702" >(c) Patent
 applications which contain disclosures of nucleotide
 and/or amino acid sequences must contain, as a separate
 part of the disclosure, a paper or compact disc copy
 (
 <i>see</i> § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e318327">1.52(e)</a> ) disclosing the nucleotide
 and/or amino acid sequences and associated information

 This paper or compact disc copy is referred to elsewhere
 in this subpart as the “Sequence Listing.” Each sequence
 disclosed must appear separately in the “Sequence
 Listing.” Each sequence set forth in the “Sequence
 Listing” must be assigned a separate sequence identifier.
 The sequence identifiers must begin with 1 and increase
 sequentially by integers. If no sequence is present for a
 sequence identifier, the code “000” must be used in place
 of the sequence. The response for the numeric identifier
 &lt;160&gt; must include the total number of SEQ ID NOs,
 whether followed by a sequence or by the code “000.”
 
 </li>
 <li id="d0e333718" >(d) Where
 the description or claims of a patent application discuss
 a sequence that is set forth in the “Sequence Listing” in
 accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, reference
 must be made to the sequence by use of the sequence
 identifier, preceded by “SEQ ID NO:” in the text of the
 description or claims, even if the sequence is also
 embedded in the text of the description or claims of the
 patent application.

 <li id="d0e333722" >(e) A copy
 of the “Sequence Listing” referred to in paragraph (c) of
 this section must also be submitted in computer readable
 form (CRF) in accordance with the requirements of § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e334418">1.824</a>.
 The computer readable form must be a copy of the “Sequence
 Listing” and may not be retained as a part of the patent
 application file. If the computer readable form of a new
 application is to be identical with the computer readable
 form of another application of the applicant on file in
 the Office, reference may be made to the other application
 and computer readable form in lieu of filing a duplicate
 computer readable form in the new application if the
 computer readable form in the other application was
 compliant with all of the requirements of this subpart.
 The new application must be accompanied by a letter making
 such reference to the other application and computer
 readable form, both of which shall be completely
 identified. In the new application, applicant must also
 request the use of the compliant computer readable
 “Sequence Listing” that is already on file for the other
 application and must state that the paper or compact disc
 copy of the “Sequence Listing” in the new application is
 identical to the computer readable copy filed for the
 other application.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e333729" >(f) In
 addition to the paper or compact disc copy required by
 paragraph (c) of this section and the computer readable
 form required by paragraph (e) of this section, a
 statement that the “Sequence Listing” content of the paper
 or compact disc copy and the computer readable copy are
 the same must be submitted with the computer readable
 form, 
 <i>e.g.</i>, a
 statement that “the sequence listing information recorded
 in computer readable form is identical to the written (on
 paper or compact disc) sequence listing.” 
 </li>
 <li id="d0e333736" >(g) If any
 of the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this

 the national stage under  <a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e307164">35 U.S.C.
 371
 </a> , applicant will be notified and
 given a period of time within which to comply with such
 requirements in order to prevent abandonment of the
 application. Any submission in reply to a requirement
 under this paragraph must be accompanied by a statement
 that the submission includes no new
 matter.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e333746" >(h) If any
 of the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this
 section are not satisfied at the time of filing an
 international application under the Patent Cooperation
 Treaty (PCT), which application is to be searched by the
 United States International Searching Authority or
 examined by the United States International Preliminary
 Examining Authority, applicant will be sent a notice
 necessitating compliance with the requirements within a
 prescribed time period. Any submission in reply to a
 requirement under this paragraph must be accompanied by a
 statement that the submission does not include matter
 which goes beyond the disclosure in the international
 application as filed. If applicant fails to timely provide
 the required computer readable form, the United States
 International Searching Authority shall search only to the
 extent that a meaningful search can be performed without
 the computer readable form and the United States
 International Preliminary Examining Authority shall
 examine only to the extent that a meaningful examination
 can be performed without the computer readable
 form.

 the proceedings that led to the disbarment,

 proof that he or she possesses good moral character
 and reputation. The following presumptions shall
 govern the determination of good moral character and
 reputation of an individual who has been licensed to
 practice law or other profession in any jurisdiction
 and has been disbarred, suspended on ethical
 grounds, or allowed to resign in lieu of discipline,
 in that jurisdiction.
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e350546" >(A) A copy of the record resulting in
 disbarment, suspension or resignation is 
 <i>prima facie</i> evidence of
 the matters contained in the record, and the
 imposition of disbarment or suspension, or the
 acceptance of the resignation of the individual
 shall be deemed conclusive that the individual has
 committed professional misconduct.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350553" >(B) The individual is ineligible for
 registration and is deemed not to have good moral
 character and reputation during the period of the
 imposed discipline.

 <li id="d0e350557" >(iii) The only defenses available with regard to an
 underlying disciplinary matter resulting in
 disbarment, suspension on ethical grounds, or
 resignation in lieu of a disciplinary proceeding are
 set out below, and must be shown to the satisfaction
 of the OED Director:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e350561" >(A) The procedure in the disciplinary
 court was so lacking in notice or opportunity to
 be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due
 process;
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350565" >(B) There was such infirmity of proof
 establishing the misconduct as to give rise to the
 clear conviction that the Office could not,
 consistently with its duty, accept as final the

 whether an individual has demonstrated rehabilitation from
 an act of misconduct or moral turpitude. The factors
 include:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e350579" >(1) The nature of the act of misconduct, including
 whether it involved moral turpitude, whether there
 were aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and
 whether the activity was an isolated event or part
 of a pattern;

 of the misconduct and the age and education of the
 individual at the present time;
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350587" >(3) The length of time that has passed between the
 misconduct and the present, absent any involvement
 in any further acts of moral turpitude, the amount
 of time and the extent of rehabilitation being
 dependent upon the nature and seriousness of the act
 of misconduct under consideration;
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350591" >(4) Restitution by the individual to any person who
 suffered monetary losses through acts or omissions
 of the individual;
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350595" >(5) Expungement of a conviction;</li>
 <li id="d0e350599" >(6) Successful completion or early discharge from
 probation or parole;
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350603" >(7) Abstinence from the use of controlled substances or
 alcohol for not less than two years if the specific

 controlled substance or alcohol, where abstinence
 may be demonstrated by, but is not necessarily
 limited to, enrolling in and complying with a
 self-help or professional treatment
 program;
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350607" >(8) If the specific misconduct was attributable in part
 to a medically recognized mental disease, disorder
 or illness, proof that the individual sought
 professional assistance, and complied with the
 treatment program prescribed by the professional,
 and submitted letters from the treating
 psychiatrist/psychologist verifying that the
 medically recognized mental disease, disorder or
 illness will not impede the individual’s ability to
 competently practice before the
 Office;

 <li id="d0e350615" >(10) Correction of behavior responsible in some degree
 for the misconduct;

 programs designed to provide social benefits or to
 ameliorate social problems; and
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350623" >(12) Change in attitude from that which existed at the
 time of the act of misconduct in question as
 evidenced by any or all of the
 following:

 with the individual’s previous misconduct and with
 subsequent attitudes and behavioral
 patterns;

 <i>Notice to Show Cause</i>. The
 OED Director shall inquire into the good moral character and
 reputation of an individual seeking registration, providing the
 individual with the opportunity to create a record on which a
 decision is made. If, following inquiry and consideration of the
 record, the OED Director is of the opinion that the individual
 seeking registration has not satisfactorily established that he
 or she possesses good moral character and reputation, the OED
 Director shall issue to the individual a notice to show cause
 why the individual’s application for registration should not be
 denied.
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e350649" >(1) The
 individual shall be given no less than ten days from the
 date of the notice to reply. The notice shall be given by
 certified mail at the address appearing on the application
 if the address is in the United States, and by any other
 reasonable means if the address is outside the United
 States.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350653" >(2) Following receipt of the individual’s response, or in the
 absence of a response, the OED Director shall consider the
 individual’s response, if any, and the record, and
 determine whether, in the OED Director’s opinion, the
 individual has sustained his or her burden of
 satisfactorily demonstrating that he or she possesses good
 moral character and reputation.

 <i>Reapplication for
 registration
 </i>. An individual who has been refused
 registration for lack of good moral character or reputation may
 reapply for registration two years after the date of the
 decision, unless a shorter period is otherwise ordered by the
 USPTO Director. An individual, who has been notified that he or
 she is under investigation for good moral character and
 reputation may elect to withdraw his or her application for
 registration, and may reapply for registration two years after
 the date of withdrawal. Upon reapplication for registration, the
 individual shall pay the fees required by § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e316474">
 1.21(a)(1)(ii)

 the OED Director his or her possession of good moral character
 and reputation as prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.
 Upon reapplication for registration, the individual also shall
 complete successfully the examination prescribed in paragraph
 (b) of this section, even though the individual has previously
 passed a registration examination.

 words and phrases in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this
 section are construed as follows:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e350838" >(i) 
 <i>Represent</i> and
 
 <i>representation</i>
 mean acting as patent attorney or patent agent or
 other representative in any appearance before the
 Office, or communicating with an employee of the
 Office with intent to influence.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350847" >(ii) 
 <i>Assist in any
 manner
 </i> means aid or help another person
 on a particular patent or patent application
 involving representation.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350853" >(iii) 
 Particular patent or patent application means any
 patent or patent application, including, but not
 limited to, a provisional, substitute,
 international, continuation, divisional,
 continuation-in-part, or reissue patent application,
 as well as any protest, reexamination, petition,
 appeal, interference, or trial proceeding based on
 the patent or patent application.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350859" >(iv) 
 <i>Participate personally and
 substantially
 </i>. (A) Basic requirements.
 The restrictions of § 
 <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e350777">11.10(a)(1)</a> apply only to
 those patents and patent applications in which a
 former Office employee had “personal and substantial
 participation,” exercised “through decision,
 approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering
 of advice, investigation or otherwise.” To 
 <i>participate personally</i>
 means directly, and includes the participation of a
 subordinate when actually directed by the former
 Office employee in the patent or patent application.
 
 <i>Substantially</i>
 means that the employee’s involvement must be of
 significance to the matter, or form a basis for a
 reasonable appearance of such significance. It
 requires more than official responsibility,
 knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or involvement
 on an administrative or peripheral issue. A finding
 of substantiality should be based not only on the
 effort devoted to a patent or patent application,
 but also on the importance of the effort. While a
 series of peripheral involvements may be
 insubstantial, the single act of approving or
 participation in a critical step may be substantial.
 It is essential that the participation be related to
 a “particular patent or patent application.”
 (
 <i>See</i> paragraph
 (b)(3)(iii) of this section.)
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e350877" >(B) Participation on ancillary
 matters. An Office employee’s participation on
 subjects not directly involving the substantive
 merits of a patent or patent application may not
 be “substantial,” even if it is time-consuming. An
 employee whose official responsibility is the
 review of a patent or patent application solely
 for compliance with administrative control or
 budgetary considerations and who reviews a
 particular patent or patent application for such a
 purpose should not be regarded as having
 participated substantially in the patent or patent
 application, except when such considerations also
 are the subject of the employee’s proposed
 representation.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350881" >(C) Role of official responsibility
 in determining substantial participation. 
 <i>Official responsibility</i>
 is defined in paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section.
 “Personal and substantial participation” is
 different from “official responsibility.” One’s
 responsibility may, however, play a role in
 determining the “substantiality” of an Office
 employee’s participation.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350888" >(v) 
 <i>Official
 responsibility
 </i> means the direct
 administrative or operating authority, whether
 intermediate or final, and either exercisable alone
 or with others, and either personally or through
 subordinates, to approve, disapprove, or otherwise
 direct Government actions.
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e350894" >(A) Determining official
 responsibility. Ordinarily, those areas assigned
 by statute, regulation, Executive Order, job
 description, or delegation of authority determine
 the scope of an employee’s “official
 responsibility”. All particular matters under
 consideration in the Office are under the
 “official responsibility” of the Director of the
 Office, and each is under that of any intermediate
 supervisor having responsibility for an employee
 who actually participates in the patent or patent
 application within the scope of his or her duties.
 A patent examiner would have “official
 responsibility” for the patent applications
 assigned to him or her.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350898" >(B) Ancillary matters and official
 responsibility. 
 <i>Administrative</i> authority as used in
 paragraph (v) of this section means authority for
 planning, organizing and controlling a patent or
 patent application rather than authority to review
 or make decisions on ancillary aspects of a patent
 or patent application such as the regularity of
 budgeting procedures, public or community
 relations aspects, or equal employment opportunity
 considerations. Responsibility for such an
 ancillary consideration does not constitute
 official responsibility for the particular patent
 or patent application, except when such a
 consideration is also the subject of the
 employee’s proposed
 representation.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350905" >(C) Duty to inquire. In order for a
 former employee, 
 <i>e.g.</i>, former patent examiner, to be
 barred from representing or assisting in
 representing another as to a particular patent or
 patent application, he or she need not have known,
 while employed by the Office, that the patent or
 patent application was pending under his or her
 official responsibility. The former employee has a
 reasonable duty of inquiry to learn whether the
 patent or patent application had been under his or
 her official responsibility. Ordinarily, a former
 employee who is asked to represent another on a
 patent or patent application will become aware of
 facts sufficient to suggest the relationship of
 the prior matter to his or her former office,
 
 <i>e.g.</i>,
 technology center, group or art unit. If so, he or
 she is under a duty to make further inquiry. It
 would be prudent for an employee to maintain a
 record of only patent application numbers of the
 applications actually acted upon by decision or
 recommendation, as well as those applications
 under the employee’s official responsibility which
 he or she has not acted upon.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350915" >(D) Self-disqualification. A former
 employee, 
 <i>e.g.</i>, former patent examiner, cannot
 avoid the restrictions of this section through
 self-disqualification with respect to a patent or
 patent application for which he or she otherwise
 had official responsibility. However, an employee
 who through self-disqualification does not
 participate personally and substantially in a
 particular patent or patent application is not
 subject to the lifetime restriction of paragraph
 (b)(1) of this section.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350922" >(vi) 
 <i>Pending</i> means
 that the matter was in fact referred to or under
 consideration by persons within the employee’s area
 of official responsibility.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350928" >(4) Measurement of the two-year restriction period. The
 two-year period under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is
 measured from the date when the employee’s official
 responsibility in a particular area ends, not from the
 termination of service in the Office, unless the two occur
 simultaneously. The prohibition applies to all particular
 patents or patent applications subject to such official
 responsibility in the one-year period before termination
 of such responsibility.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350932" >(c) 
 <i>Former employees of the
 Office
 </i>. This section imposes restrictions generally
 parallel to those imposed in 18 U.S.C. 207(a) and (b)(1). This
 section, however, does not interpret these statutory provisions
 or any other post-employment restrictions that may apply to
 former Office employees, and such former employees should not
 assume that conduct not prohibited by this section is otherwise
 permissible. Former employees of the Office, whether or not they
 are practitioners, are encouraged to contact the Department of
 Commerce for information concerning applicable post-employment
 restrictions.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350938" >(d) An employee
 of the Office may not prosecute or aid in any manner in the
 prosecution of any patent application before the
 Office.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e350942" >(e) Practice
 before the Office by Government employees is subject to any
 applicable conflict of interest laws, regulations or codes of
 professional responsibility.

 from the date of filing the notice of appeal under § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356411">41.31</a>. The
 appeal brief fee in an application or 
 <i>ex parte</i>
 reexamination proceeding is $0.00, but if the appeal results in an
 examiner's answer, the appeal forwarding fee set forth in § <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">41.20(b)(4)</a> must be paid
 within the time period specified in § <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">41.45</a> to avoid dismissal of

 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e356626" >(1) Except as
 otherwise provided in this paragraph, the brief shall contain
 the following items under appropriate headings and in the
 order indicated in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (v) of this
 section, except that a brief filed by an appellant who is not
 represented by a registered practitioner need only
 substantially comply with paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii),
 (c)(1)(iv), and (c)(1)(v) of this section:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e356630" >(i) 
 <i>Real party in interest</i>. A statement
 identifying by name the real party in interest at the
 time the appeal brief is filed, except that such
 statement is not required if the named inventor or
 inventors are themselves the real party in interest. If
 an appeal brief does not contain a statement of the
 real party in interest, the Office may assume that the
 named inventor or inventors are the real party in
 interest.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e356636" >(ii) 
 <i>Related appeals, interferences, and
 trials
 </i>. A statement identifying by
 application, patent, appeal, interference, or trial
 number all other prior and pending appeals,
 interferences, trials before the Board, or judicial
 proceedings (collectively, "related cases") which
 satisfy all of the following conditions: involve an
 application or patent owned by the appellant or
 assignee, are known to appellant, the appellant’s legal
 representative, or assignee, and may be related to,
 directly affect or be directly affected by or have a
 bearing on the Board’s decision in the pending appeal,
 except that such statement is not required if there are
 no such related cases. If an appeal brief does not
 contain a statement of related cases, the Office may
 assume that there are no such related
 cases.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e356642" >(iii) 
 <i>Summary of claimed subject matter</i>. A
 concise explanation of the subject matter defined in
 each of the rejected independent claims, which shall
 refer to the specification in the Record by page and
 line number or by paragraph number, and to the drawing,
 if any, by reference characters. For each rejected
 independent claim, and for each dependent claim argued
 separately under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(iv)
 of this section, if the claim contains a means plus
 function or step plus function recitation as permitted
 by  <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">35 U.S.C.
 112(f)
 </a> , then the concise
 explanation must identify the structure, material, or
 acts described in the specification in the Record as
 corresponding to each claimed function with reference
 to the specification in the Record by page and line
 number or by paragraph number, and to the drawing, if
 any, by reference characters. Reference to the patent
 application publication does not satisfy the
 requirements of this paragraph.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e356651" >(iv) 
 <i>Argument</i>. The arguments of appellant
 with respect to each ground of rejection, and the basis
 therefor, with citations of the statutes, regulations,
 authorities, and parts of the Record relied on. The
 arguments shall explain why the examiner erred as to
 each ground of rejection contested by appellant. Except
 as provided for in §§ <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">41.41</a> ,
  <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">41.47</a> and
  <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">41.52</a> , any
 arguments or authorities not included in the appeal
 brief will be refused consideration by the Board for
 purposes of the present appeal. Each ground of
 rejection contested by appellant must be argued under a
 separate heading, and each heading shall reasonably
 identify the ground of rejection being contested
 (
 <i>e.g.</i>, by claim number, statutory
 basis, and applied reference, if any). For each ground
 of rejection applying to two or more claims, the claims
 may be argued separately (claims are considered by
 appellant as separately patentable), as a group (all
 claims subject to the ground of rejection stand or fall
 together), or as a subgroup (a subset of the claims
 subject to the ground of rejection stand or fall
 together). When multiple claims subject to the same
 ground of rejection are argued as a group or subgroup
 by appellant, the Board may select a single claim from
 the group or subgroup and may decide the appeal as to
 the ground of rejection with respect to the group or
 subgroup on the basis of the selected claim alone.
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph,
 the failure of appellant to separately argue claims
 which appellant has grouped together shall constitute a
 waiver of any argument that the Board must consider the
 patentability of any grouped claim separately. Under
 each heading identifying the ground of rejection being
 contested, any claim(s) argued separately or as a
 subgroup shall be argued under a separate subheading
 that identifies the claim(s) by number. A statement
 which merely points out what a claim recites will not
 be considered an argument for separate patentability of
 the claim.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e356657" >(v) 
 <i>Claims appendix</i>. An appendix
 containing a copy of the claims involved in the
 appeal.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e356711" >(2) A brief
 shall not include any new or non-admitted amendment, or any
 new or non-admitted affidavit or other Evidence.

 appellant does not, within the set time period, file an amended

 <i>Affirmance and reversal</i>. The Board, in
 its decision, may affirm or reverse the decision of the
 examiner in whole or in part on the grounds and on the claims
 specified by the examiner. The affirmance of the rejection of
 a claim on any of the grounds specified constitutes a general
 affirmance of the decision of the examiner on that claim,
 except as to any ground specifically reversed. The Board may
 also remand an application to the examiner.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e356993" >(2) If a
 substitute examiner's answer is written in response to a
 remand by the Board for further consideration of a rejection
 pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the appellant
 must within two months from the date of the substitute
 examiner's answer exercise one of the following two options
 to avoid sua sponte dismissal of the appeal as to the claims
 subject to the rejection for which the Board has remanded the
 proceeding:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e356997" >(i) 
 <i>Reopen prosecution</i>. Request that
 prosecution be reopened before the examiner by filing a
 reply under § <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">1.111</a> of this
 title with or without amendment or submission of
 affidavits (§§ <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">1.130</a> ,

  <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">1.132</a> of this
 title) or other Evidence. Any amendment or submission
 of affidavits or other Evidence must be relevant to the
 issues set forth in the remand or raised in the
 substitute examiner's answer. A request that complies
 with this paragraph (a) will be entered and the
 application or the patent under 
 <i>ex
 parte
 </i> reexamination will be reconsidered
 by the examiner under the provisions of § <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">1.112</a> of this
 title. Any request that prosecution be reopened under
 this paragraph will be treated as a request to withdraw
 the appeal.

 <i>Maintain appeal</i>. Request that the
 appeal be maintained by filing a reply brief as
 provided in § <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">41.41</a>. If such
 a reply brief is accompanied by any amendment,
 affidavit or other Evidence, it shall be treated as a

 <i>New
 ground of rejection
 </i>. Should the Board have knowledge
 of any grounds not involved in the appeal for rejecting any pending
 claim, it may include in its opinion a statement to that effect
 with its reasons for so holding, and designate such a statement as
 a new ground of rejection of the claim. A new ground of rejection
 pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered final for
 judicial review. When the Board enters such a non-final decision,
 the appellant, within two months from the date of the decision,
 must exercise one of the following two options with respect to the
 new ground of rejection to avoid termination of the appeal as to
 the rejected claims:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e357034" >(1) 
 <i>Reopen prosecution</i>. Submit an appropriate
 amendment of the claims so rejected or new Evidence relating
 to the claims so rejected, or both, and have the matter
 reconsidered by the examiner, in which event the prosecution
 will be remanded to the examiner. The new ground of rejection
 is binding upon the examiner unless an amendment or new
 Evidence not previously of Record is made which, in the
 opinion of the examiner, overcomes the new ground of
 rejection designated in the decision. Should the examiner
 reject the claims, appellant may again appeal to the Board
 pursuant to this subpart.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e357040" >(2) 
 <i>Request rehearing</i>. Request that the
 proceeding be reheard under § <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">41.52</a> by the Board
 upon the same Record. The request for rehearing must address
 any new ground of rejection and state with particularity the
 points believed to have been misapprehended or overlooked in
 entering the new ground of rejection and also state all other
 grounds upon which rehearing is sought.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e357049" >(c) 
 <i>Review
 of undesignated new ground of rejection
 </i>. Any request
 to seek review of a panel's failure to designate a new ground of
 rejection in its decision must be raised by filing a request for
 rehearing as set forth in § <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">41.52</a>. Failure of appellant
 to timely file such a request for rehearing will constitute a
 waiver of any arguments that a decision contains an undesignated
 new ground of rejection.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e357053" >(d) 
 <i>Request for briefing and information</i>. The
 Board may order appellant to additionally brief any matter that the
 Board considers to be of assistance in reaching a reasoned decision
 on the pending appeal. Appellant will be given a time period within
 which to respond to such an order. Failure to timely comply with
 the order may result in the sua sponte dismissal of the
 appeal.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e357057" >(e) 
 <i>Remand
 not final action
 </i>. Whenever a decision of the Board
 includes a remand, that decision shall not be considered final for
 judicial review. When appropriate, upon conclusion of proceedings
 on remand before the examiner, the Board may enter an order
 otherwise making its decision final for judicial
 review.

 the real party in interest.

 <li id="d0e357429" >(ii) 
 <i>Related appeals,
 interferences, and trials
 </i>. A statement
 identifying by application, patent, appeal or
 interference number all other prior and pending
 appeals, interferences or judicial proceedings known to
 appellant, the appellant’s legal representative, or
 assignee which may be related to, directly affect or be
 directly affected by or have a bearing on the Board’s
 decision in the pending appeal. Copies of any decisions
 rendered by a court or the Board in any proceeding
 identified under this paragraph must be included in an
 appendix as required by paragraph (c)(1)(xi) of this
 section.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e357435" >(iii) 
 <i>Status of claims</i>. A
 statement of the status of all the claims in the
 proceeding (e.g., rejected, allowed or confirmed,
 withdrawn, objected to, canceled). If the appellant is
 the owner, the appellant must also identify the
 rejected claims whose rejection is being appealed. If
 the appellant is a requester, the appellant must
 identify the claims that the examiner has made a
 determination favorable to patentability, which
 determination is being appealed.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e357441" >(iv) 
 <i>Status of
 amendments
 </i>. A statement of the status of
 any amendment filed subsequent to the close of
 prosecution.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e357447" >(v) 
 <i>Summary of claimed subject
 matter
 </i>. A concise explanation of the
 subject matter defined in each of the independent
 claims involved in the appeal, which shall refer to the
 specification by column and line number, and to the
 drawing(s), if any, by reference characters. For each
 independent claim involved in the appeal and for each
 dependent claim argued separately under the provisions
 of paragraph (c)(1)(vii) of this section, every means
 plus function and step plus function as permitted by
  <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">35 U.S.C.
 112(f)
 </a> , must be identified and
 the structure, material, or acts described in the
 specification as corresponding to each claimed function
 must be set forth with reference to the specification
 by page and line number, and to the drawing, if any, by
 reference characters.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e357456" >(vi) 
 <i>Issues to be reviewed on
 appeal
 </i>. A concise statement of each issue
 presented for review. No new ground of rejection can be
 proposed by a third party requester appellant, unless
 such ground was withdrawn by the examiner during the
 prosecution of the proceeding, and the third party
 requester has not yet had an opportunity to propose it
 as a third party requester proposed ground of
 rejection.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e357462" >(vii) 
 <i>Argument</i>. The
 contentions of appellant with respect to each issue
 presented for review in paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of this
 section, and the basis therefor, with citations of the
 statutes, regulations, authorities, and parts of the
 record relied on. Any arguments or authorities not
 included in the brief permitted under this section or
 §§  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e357524">41.68</a> and  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e357691">41.71</a> will be refused
 consideration by the Board, unless good cause is shown.
 Each issue must be treated under a separate heading. If
 the appellant is the patent owner, for each ground of
 rejection in the Right of Appeal Notice which appellant
 contests and which applies to two or more claims, the
 claims may be argued separately or as a group. When
 multiple claims subject to the same ground of rejection
 are argued as a group by appellant, the Board may
 select a single claim from the group of claims that are
 argued together to decide the appeal with respect to
 the group of claims as to the ground of rejection on
 the basis of the selected claim alone. Notwithstanding
 any other provision of this paragraph, the failure of
 appellant to separately argue claims which appellant
 has grouped together shall constitute a waiver of any
 argument that the Board must consider the patentability
 of any grouped claim separately. Any claim argued
 separately should be placed under a subheading
 identifying the claim by number. Claims argued as a
 group should be placed under a subheading identifying
 the claims by number. A statement which merely points
 out what a claim recites will not be considered an
 argument for separate patentability of the
 claim.

 decision of the examiner on all issues raised on each appealed
 claim, or remand the reexamination proceeding to the examiner for
 further consideration. The reversal of the examiner’s determination
 not to make a rejection proposed by the third party requester
 constitutes a decision adverse to the patentability of the claims
 which are subject to that proposed rejection which will be set
 forth in the decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board as a new
 ground of rejection under paragraph (b) of this section. The
 affirmance of the rejection of a claim on any of the grounds
 specified constitutes a general affirmance of the decision of the
 examiner on that claim, except as to any ground specifically
 reversed.

 Board reverse the examiner’s determination not to make a rejection

 in support of its decision a new ground of rejection; or should the
 Board have knowledge of any grounds not raised in the appeal for
 rejecting any pending claim, it may include in its opinion a
 statement to that effect with its reasons for so holding, which
 statement shall constitute a new ground of rejection of the claim.
 Any decision which includes a new ground of rejection pursuant to
 this paragraph shall not be considered final for judicial review.
 When the Board makes a new ground of rejection, the owner, within
 one month from the date of the decision, must exercise one of the
 following two options with respect to the new ground of rejection
 to avoid termination of the appeal proceeding as to the rejected
 claim:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e357811" >(1) 
 <i>
 <i>Reopen
 prosecution
 </i>.
 </i> The owner may file a
 response requesting reopening of prosecution before the
 examiner. Such a response must be either an amendment of the
 claims so rejected or new evidence relating to the claims so
 rejected, or both.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e357819" >(2) 
 <i>Request rehearing</i>. The
 owner may request that the proceeding be reheard under § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e357857">41.79</a> by
 the Board upon the same record. The request for rehearing
 must address any new ground of rejection and state with

 or overlooked in entering the new ground of rejection and
 also state all other grounds upon which rehearing is
 sought.

 has filed a response requesting reopening of prosecution under
 paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any requester, within one month
 of the date of service of the owner’s response, may once file
 comments on the response. Such written comments must be limited to
 the issues raised by the Board’s opinion reflecting its decision
 and the owner’s response. Any requester that had not previously
 filed an appeal or cross appeal and is seeking under this
 subsection to file comments or a reply to the comments is subject
 to the appeal and brief fees under § <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">41.20(b)(1)</a> and
  <a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">(2)</a> , respectively, which

 </li>
 <li id="d0e357832" >(d) Following any
 response by the owner under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and
 any written comments from a requester under paragraph (c) of this
 section, the proceeding will be remanded to the examiner. The
 statement of the Board shall be binding upon the examiner unless an
 amendment or new evidence not previously of record is made which,
 in the opinion of the examiner, overcomes the new ground of
 rejection stated in the decision. The examiner will consider any
 owner response under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and any
 written comments by a requester under paragraph (c) of this section
 and issue a determination that the rejection is maintained or has
 been overcome.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e357836" >(e) Within one
 month of the examiner’s determination pursuant to paragraph (d) of
 this section, the owner or any requester may once submit comments
 in response to the examiner’s determination. Within one month of
 the date of service of comments in response to the examiner’s
 determination, the owner and any requesters may file a reply to the
 comments. No requester reply may address the comments of any other
 requester reply. Any requester that had not previously filed an
 appeal or cross appeal and is seeking under this subsection to file
 comments or a reply to the comments is subject to the appeal and
 brief fees under § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356279">

 <li id="d0e357843" >(f) After
 submission of any comments and any reply pursuant to paragraph (e)
 of this section, or after time has expired, the proceeding will be
 returned to the Board which shall reconsider the matter and issue a
 new decision. The new decision is deemed to incorporate the earlier
 decision, except for those portions specifically
 withdrawn.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e357847" >(g) The time period
 set forth in paragraph (b) of this section is subject to the
 extension of time provisions of §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e335528">1.956</a> of this title when the owner is

 <i>Patentee</i>. A patentee cannot
 suggest an interference under this section but may, to the extent

 require an applicant to add a claim to provoke an interference.
 Failure to satisfy the requirement within a period (not less than
 one month) the examiner sets will operate as a concession of
 priority for the subject matter of the claim. If the interference
 would be with a patent, the applicant must also comply with
 paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6) of this section. The claim the
 examiner proposes to have added must, apart from the question of
 priority under  <a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383">35 U.S.C.

 applicant must show why it would prevail on
 priority.

 <li id="d0e359623" >(2) If an
 applicant fails to show priority under paragraph (d)(1) of
 this section, an administrative patent judge may nevertheless
 declare an interference to place the applicant under an order
 to show cause why judgment should not be entered against the
 applicant on priority. New evidence in support of priority
 will not be admitted except on a showing of good cause. The

 <i>Order of invention</i>. Parties are
 presumed to have invented interfering subject matter in the order

 to a presumption of priority with respect to the other such

 Priority may be proved by a preponderance of the evidence

 corresponding to the count. No presumption based on claim
 correspondence regarding the grouping of claims exists for other
 grounds of unpatentability.

 <li id="d0e360024" >(b) There is no
 obligation to create, compile, or obtain from outside USPTO a record
 to satisfy a FOIA request. With regard to electronic data, the issue
 of whether records are created or merely extracted from an existing
 database is not always apparent. When responding to FOIA requests for
 electronic data where creation of a record or programming becomes an
 issue, USPTO shall undertake reasonable efforts to search for the
 information in electronic format.

 Requirements for making requests.
 </h1>
 <div id="d0e360046" class="List">
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360047" >(a) A request for
 USPTO records that are not customarily made available to the public as
 part of USPTO’s regular informational services must be in writing, and
 shall be processed under FOIA, regardless of whether FOIA is mentioned
 in the request. Requests should be sent to the USPTO FOIA Officer,
 United States Patent and Trademark Office, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria,
 Virginia 22313-1450 (records FOIA requires to be made regularly
 available for public inspection and copying are addressed in
 §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e359953">102.2(c)</a> ). For the
 quickest handling, the request letter and envelope should be marked
 “Freedom of Information Act Request.” For requests for records about
 oneself, §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e361069">102.24</a> contains
 additional requirements. For requests for records about another
 individual, either a written authorization signed by that individual
 permitting disclosure of those records to the requester or proof that
 individual is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or
 an obituary) facilitates processing the request.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360057" >(b) The records
 requested must be described in enough detail to enable USPTO personnel
 to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible,
 a request should include specific information about each record
 sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and
 subject matter of the record, and the name and location of the office
 where the record is located. Also, if records about a court case are
 sought, the title of the case, the court in which the case was filed,
 and the nature of the case should be included. If known, any file
 designations or descriptions for the requested records should be
 included. In general, the more specifically the request describes the
 records sought, the greater the likelihood that USPTO will locate
 those records. If the FOIA Officer determines that a request does not
 reasonably describe records, the FOIA Officer will inform the
 requester what additional information is needed or why the request is
 otherwise insufficient. The FOIA Officer also may give the requester
 an opportunity to discuss the request so that it may be modified to
 meet the requirements of this section.

 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360072" >(a) 
 <i>In general</i>. Except as stated in
 paragraph (b) of this section, the USPTO will process FOIA requests
 directed to USPTO. In determining records responsive to a request, the
 FOIA Officer shall include only those records within USPTO’s
 possession and control as of the date the FOIA Officer receives the
 request.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360078" >(b) 
 <i>Consultations and referrals</i>. If
 the FOIA Officer receives a request for a record in USPTO’s possession
 in which another Federal agency subject to FOIA has the primary
 interest, the FOIA Officer shall refer the record to that agency for
 direct response to the requester. The FOIA Officer shall consult with
 another Federal agency before responding to a requester if the FOIA
 Officer receives a request for a record in which another Federal
 agency subject to FOIA has a significant interest, but not the primary
 interest; or another Federal agency not subject to FOIA has the
 primary interest or a significant interest. Ordinarily, the agency
 that originated a record will be presumed to have the primary interest
 in it.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360084" >(c) 
 <i>Notice of referral</i>. Whenever a
 FOIA Officer refers a document to another Federal agency for direct
 response to the requester, the FOIA Officer will ordinarily notify the
 requester in writing of the referral and inform the requester of the
 name of the agency to which the document was referred.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360090" >(d) 
 <i>Timing of responses to consultations and
 referrals

 handled according to the date the FOIA request was received by the
 first Federal agency.
 </li>

 <i>In general</i>. The FOIA Officer

 </li>
 <li id="d0e360119" >(b) 
 <i>Initial response and appeal.</i>
 Subject to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an initial response shall
 be made within 20 working days (
 <i>i.e.,</i> excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public
 holidays) of the receipt of a request for a record under this part by
 the proper FOIA Officer identified in accordance with
 §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e360064">102.5(a)</a> , and an
 appeal shall be decided within 20 working days of its receipt by the
 Office of the General Counsel.

 <li id="d0e360131" >(c) 
 <i>Unusual circumstances</i>. 
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360137" >(1) In unusual
 circumstances as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section,
 the FOIA Officer may extend the time limits in paragraph (b) of
 this section by notifying the requester in writing as soon as
 practicable of the unusual circumstances and of the date by
 which processing of the request is expected to be completed.
 Extensions of time for the initial determination and extensions
 on appeal may not exceed a total of ten working days, unless the
 requester agrees to a longer extension, or the FOIA Officer
 provides the requester with an opportunity either to limit the
 scope of the request so that it may be processed within the
 applicable time limit, or to arrange an alternative time frame
 for processing the request or a modified
 request.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360141" >(2) As used in
 this section, 
 <i>unusual
 circumstances
 </i>, means, but only to the extent
 reasonably necessary to properly process the particular
 request:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360148" >(i) The
 need to search for and collect the requested records from
 field facilities or other establishments separate from the
 office processing the request;
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360152" >(ii) The
 need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a
 voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that
 are the subject of a single request; or
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360156" >(iii) The
 need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all
 practicable speed, with another Federal agency having a
 substantial interest in the determination of the
 request.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360160" >(3) Unusual
 circumstances do not include a delay that results from a
 predictable workload of requests, unless USPTO demonstrates
 reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.
 Refusal to reasonably modify the scope of a request or arrange
 an alternate time frame may affect a requester’s ability to
 obtain judicial review.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360164" >(4) If the FOIA
 Officer reasonably believes that multiple requests submitted by
 a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert,
 constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual
 circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters,
 the FOIA Officer may aggregate them. Multiple requests involving
 unrelated matters will not be aggregated.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360168" >(d) 
 <i>Multitrack
 processing
 </i>.
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360174" >(1) The FOIA
 Officer may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing
 between simple and more complex requests based on the number of
 pages involved, or some other measure of the amount of work
 and/or time needed to process the request, and whether the
 request qualifies for expedited processing as described in
 paragraph (e) of this section.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360178" >(2) The FOIA
 Officer may provide requesters in a slower track with an
 opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to
 qualify for faster processing. The FOIA Officer may contact the
 requester by telephone or by letter, whichever is most efficient
 in each case.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360182" >(e) 
 <i>Expedited
 processing
 </i>.
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360188" >(1) Requests and
 appeals shall be taken out of order and given expedited
 treatment whenever it is determined they
 involve:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360192" >(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment
 could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to
 the life or physical safety of an
 individual;
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360196" >(ii) The
 loss of substantial due process rights;
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360200" >(iii) A
 matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in
 which there exist questions about the Government’s
 integrity that affect public confidence;
 or
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360204" >(iv) An
 urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged
 Federal Government activity, if made by a person primarily
 engaged in disseminating information.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360208" >(2) A request
 for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial
 request for records or at any later time. For a prompt
 determination, a request for expedited processing should be sent
 to the FOIA Officer.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360212" >(3) A requester
 who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement,
 certified to be true and correct to the best of that person’s
 knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for
 requesting expedited processing. For example, a requester within
 the category described in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section,
 if not a full-time member of the news media, must establish that
 he or she is a person whose main professional activity or
 occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be
 his or her sole occupation. A requester within the category
 described in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section must also
 establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the
 Government activity involved in the request, beyond the public’s
 right to know about Government activity generally. The formality
 of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative
 discretion.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360216" >(4) Within ten
 calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited processing,
 the FOIA Officer will decide whether to grant it and shall
 notify the requester of the decision. If a request for expedited
 treatment is granted, the request shall be given priority and
 processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited
 processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted
 on expeditiously.

 under §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e360452">102.11</a> and
 disclose records to the requester promptly upon payment of any
 applicable fee. Records disclosed in part shall be marked or annotated
 to show each applicable FOIA exemption and the amount of information
 deleted, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an
 applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted shall
 also be indicated on the record, if feasible.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360240" >(b) 
 <i>Adverse determinations of
 requests
 </i>. If the FOIA Officer makes an adverse determination
 regarding a request, the FOIA Officer will notify the requester of
 that determination in writing. An adverse determination is a denial of
 a request in any respect, namely: A determination to withhold any
 requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested
 record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that a
 record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the
 requester; a determination that what has been requested is not a
 record subject to FOIA (except that a determination under
 §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e360452">102.11(j)</a> that
 records are to be made available under a fee statute other than FOIA
 is not an adverse determination); a determination against the
 requester on any disputed fee matter, including a denial of a request
 for a fee waiver; or a denial of a request for expedited treatment.

 1450, Alexandria, Virginia 22313-1450. Both the letter and the appeal
 envelope should be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Appeal”. The
 appeal must include a copy of the original request and the initial
 denial, if any, and may include a statement of the reasons why the
 records requested should be made available and why the initial denial,
 if any, was in error. No opportunity for personal appearance, oral
 argument or hearing on appeal is provided.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360415" >(c) If an appeal is
 granted, the person making the appeal shall be immediately notified
 and copies of the releasable documents shall be made available
 promptly thereafter upon receipt of appropriate fees determined in
 accordance with §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e360452">102.11</a>.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360422" >(d) If no

 twenty-working-day period specified in §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e360105">102.6(b)</a> or the last extension thereof, the
 requester is deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with
 respect to the request, giving rise to a right of judicial review
 under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C). If the person making a request initiates
 a civil action against USPTO based on the provision in this paragraph,
 the administrative appeal process may continue.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360429" >(e) A determination on

 <div id="d0e360459" class="List">
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360460" >(a) 
 <i>In general</i>. USPTO shall charge for
 processing requests under FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of
 this section, except when fees are limited under paragraph (d) of this
 section or when a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under
 paragraph (k) of this section. USPTO shall collect all applicable fees
 before sending copies of requested records to a requester. Requesters
 must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of
 the United States.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360466" >(b) 
 <i>Definitions</i>. For purposes of this
 section:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360472" >(1) 
 <i>Commercial use request</i> means
 a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information
 for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade,
 or profit interests, which can include furthering those
 interests through litigation. The FOIA Officer shall determine,
 whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will
 put the requested records. When it appears that the requester
 will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the
 nature of the request itself or because the FOIA Officer has
 reasonable cause to doubt a requester’s stated use, the FOIA
 Officer shall provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to
 submit further clarification.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360478" >(2) 
 <i>Direct costs</i> means those
 expenses USPTO incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in
 the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records to
 respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example,
 the labor costs of the employee performing the work (the basic
 rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to
 cover benefits). Not included in direct costs are overhead
 expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of
 the facility in which the records are kept.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360484" >(3) 
 <i>Duplication</i> means the making
 of a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it,
 necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies may take the form
 of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or electronic
 records (for example, magnetic tape or disk), among others. The
 FOIA Officer shall honor a requester’s specified preference of
 form or format of disclosure if the record is readily
 reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or
 format.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360490" >(4) 
 <i>Educational institution</i>
 means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary
 school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an
 institution of graduate higher education, an institution of
 professional education, or an institution of vocational
 education, that operates a program of scholarly research. To be
 in this category, a requester must show that the request is
 authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying
 institution, and that the records are sought to further
 scholarly research rather than for a commercial
 use.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360496" >(5) 
 <i>Noncommercial scientific
 institution
 </i> means an institution that is not
 operated on a “commercial” basis, as that term is defined in
 paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely
 for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results
 of which are not intended to promote any particular product or
 industry. To be in this category, a requester must show that the
 request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a
 qualifying institution and that the records are sought to
 further scientific research rather than for a commercial use.
 
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360502" >(6) 
 <i>Representative of the news media, or
 news media requester
 </i> means any person actively
 gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to
 publish or broadcast news to the public. The term “news” means
 information that is about current events or that would be of
 current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities
 include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public
 at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if they can
 qualify as disseminators of “news”) that make their products
 available for purchase or subscription by the general public.
 For “freelance” journalists to be regarded as working for a news
 organization, they must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting
 publication through that organization. A publication contract
 would be the clearest proof, but the FOIA Officer shall also
 look to the past publication record of a requester in making
 this determination. To be in this category, a requester must not
 be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However,
 a request for records supporting the news-dissemination function
 of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial
 use.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360508" >(7) 
 <i>Review</i> means the examination
 of a record located in response to a request in order to
 determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure.
 It also includes processing any record for disclosure—for
 example, doing all that is necessary to redact it and prepare it
 for disclosure. Review costs are recoverable even if a record
 ultimately is not disclosed. Review time does not include time
 spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the
 application of exemptions.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360514" >(8) 
 <i>Search</i> means the process of
 looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to
 a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line
 identification of information within records and also includes
 reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from
 records maintained in electronic form or format. The FOIA
 Officer shall ensure that searches are done in the most
 efficient and least expensive manner reasonably
 possible.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360520" >(c) 
 <i>Fees</i>. In responding to FOIA
 requests, the FOIA Officer shall charge the fees summarized in chart
 form in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section and explained in
 paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(5) of this section, unless a waiver or
 reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this
 section.

 <i>Search</i>.
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360668" >(i) Search
 fees shall be charged for all requests—other than requests
 made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific
 institutions, or representatives of the news media—subject
 to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. The
 FOIA Officer will charge for time spent searching even if
 no responsive records are located or if located records
 are entirely exempt from disclosure. Search fees shall be
 the direct costs of conducting the search by the involved
 employees
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360672" >(ii) For
 computer searches of records, requesters will be charged
 the direct costs of conducting the search, although
 certain requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of
 this section) will be charged no search fee and certain
 other requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this
 section) are entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours
 of manual search time without charge. These direct costs
 include the costs, attributable to the search, of
 operating a central processing unit and
 operator/programmer salary.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360676" >(4) 
 <i>Duplication</i>. Duplication
 fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the
 limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. For a paper
 photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of which need be
 supplied), the fee shall be $.15 cents per page. For copies
 produced by computer, such as tapes or printouts, the FOIA
 Officer shall charge the direct costs, including operator time,
 of producing the copy. For other forms of duplication, the FOIA
 Officer will charge the direct costs of that
 duplication.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360682" >(5) 
 <i>Review</i>. Review fees shall be
 charged to requesters who make a commercial use request. Review
 fees shall be charged only for the initial record review—the
 review done when the FOIA Officer determines whether an
 exemption applies to a particular record at the initial request
 level. No charge will be made for review at the administrative
 appeal level for an exemption already applied. However, records
 withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not
 to apply may be reviewed again to determine whether any other
 exemption not previously considered applies, and the costs of
 that review are chargeable. Review fees shall be the direct
 costs of conducting the review by the involved
 employees.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360688" >(d) 
 <i>Limitations on charging fees.</i>
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360693" >(1) No search
 fee will be charged for requests by educational institutions,
 noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the
 news media.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360697" >(2) No search
 fee or review fee will be charged for a quarter-hour period
 unless more than half of that period is required for search or
 review.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360701" >(3) Except for
 requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the FOIA
 Officer will provide without charge:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360705" >(i) The
 first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent);
 and
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360709" >(ii) The
 first two hours of search (or the cost
 equivalent).
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360713" >(4) Whenever a
 total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is
 $20.00 or less for any request, no fee will be
 charged.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360717" >(5) The
 provisions of paragraphs (d) (3) and (4) of this section work
 together. This means that for requesters other than those
 seeking records for a commercial use, no fee will be charged
 unless the cost of the search in excess of two hours plus the
 cost of duplication in excess of 100 pages totals more than
 $20.00.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360721" >(e) 
 <i>Notice of anticipated fees over
 $20.00
 </i>. When the FOIA Officer determines or estimates
 that the fees to be charged under this section will be more than
 $20.00, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester of the actual or
 estimated fees, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to
 pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee
 can be estimated readily, the FOIA Officer shall advise the requester
 that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee. If the
 FOIA Officer has notified a requester that actual or estimated fees
 are more than $20.00, the FOIA Officer shall not consider the request
 received or process it further until the requester agrees to pay the
 anticipated total fee. Any such agreement should be in writing. A
 notice under this paragraph shall offer the requester an opportunity
 to discuss the matter with USPTO personnel in order to reformulate the
 request to meet the requester’s needs at a lower cost.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360727" >(f) 
 <i>Charges for other services</i>. Apart
 from the other provisions of this section, the FOIA Officer shall
 ordinarily charge the direct cost of special services. Such special
 services could include certifying that records are true copies or
 sending records by other than ordinary mail.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360733" >(g) 
 <i>Charging interest</i>. The FOIA
 Officer shall charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st
 calendar day following the date of billing the requester. Interest
 charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and
 accrue from the date of the billing until payment is received by the
 FOIA Officer. The FOIA Officer shall follow the provisions of the Debt
 Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134), as amended, and
 its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting
 agencies, collection agencies, and offset.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360739" >(h) 
 <i>Aggregating requests</i>. If a FOIA
 Officer reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters
 acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of
 requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the FOIA Officer may
 aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The FOIA Officer may
 presume that multiple requests of this type made within a
 30-calendar-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. If
 requests are separated by a longer period, the FOIA Officer shall
 aggregate them only if a solid basis exists for determining that
 aggregation is warranted under all the circumstances involved.
 Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be
 aggregated.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360745" >(i) 
 <i>Advance payments.</i>
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360750" >(1) For requests
 other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) and (3) of this
 section, the FOIA Officer shall not require the requester to
 make an advance payment: a payment made before work is begun or
 continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed
 (
 <i>i.e.,</i> a payment before
 copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance
 payment.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360757" >(2) If the FOIA
 Officer determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged
 under this section will be more than $250.00, the requester must
 pay the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the
 request, unless the FOIA Officer receives a satisfactory
 assurance of full payment from a requester who has a history of
 prompt payment.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360761" >(3) If a
 requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA
 fee to USPTO or another responsible Federal agency within 30
 calendar days of the date of billing, the FOIA Officer shall
 require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus any
 applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full
 amount of any anticipated fee, before the FOIA Officer begins to
 process a new request or continues to process a pending request
 from that requester.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360765" >(4) In cases in
 which the FOIA Officer requires payment under paragraphs (i)(2)
 or (3) of this section, the request shall not be considered
 received and further work will not be done on it until the
 required payment is received.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360769" >(5) Upon the
 completion of processing of a request, when a specific fee is
 determined to be payable and appropriate notice has been given
 to the requester, the FOIA Officer shall make records available
 to the requester only upon receipt of full payment of the
 fee.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360773" >(j) 
 <i>Other statutes specifically providing for
 fees
 </i>. The fee schedule of this section does not apply to
 fees charged under any statute (except for FOIA) that specifically
 requires USPTO or another responsible Federal agency to set and
 collect fees for particular types of records. If records responsive to
 requests are maintained for distribution by agencies operating such
 statutorily based fee schedule programs, the FOIA Officer shall inform
 requesters of how to obtain records from those
 sources.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360779" >(k) 
 <i>Requirements for waiver or reduction of
 fees
 </i>.
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360785" >(1) Records
 responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a
 charge reduced below that established under paragraph (c) of
 this section if the FOIA Officer determines, based on all
 available information, that the requester has demonstrated
 that:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360789" >(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public
 interest because it is likely to contribute significantly
 to public understanding of the operations or activities of
 the Government; and
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360793" >(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the
 commercial interest of the requester.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360797" >(2) To determine
 whether the first fee waiver requirement is met, the FOIA
 Officer shall consider the following factors:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360801" >(i) 
 <i>The subject of the
 request
 </i>: whether the subject of the requested
 records concerns the operations or activities of the
 Government. The subject of the requested records must
 concern identifiable operations or activities of the
 Federal Government, with a connection that is direct and
 clear, not remote or attenuated.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360807" >(ii) 
 <i>The informative value of the
 information to be disclosed:
 </i> whether the
 disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding
 of Government operations or activities. The disclosable
 portions of the requested records must be meaningfully
 informative about Government operations or activities in
 order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public
 understanding of those operations or activities. The
 disclosure of information that already is in the public
 domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially
 identical form, would not be likely to contribute to such
 understanding.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360813" >(iii) 
 <i>The contribution to an
 understanding of the subject by the public likely to
 result from disclosure:
 </i> whether disclosure of
 the requested information will contribute to the
 understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons
 interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual
 understanding of the requester. A requester’s expertise in
 the subject area and ability and intention to effectively
 convey information to the public shall be considered. It
 shall be presumed that a representative of the news media
 satisfies this consideration. It shall be presumed that a
 requester who merely provides information to media sources
 does not satisfy this consideration.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360819" >(iv) 
 <i>The significance of the
 contribution to public understanding:
 </i> whether
 the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to
 public understanding of Government operations or
 activities. The public’s understanding of the subject in
 question prior to the disclosure must be significantly
 enhanced by the disclosure.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360825" >(3) To determine
 whether the second fee waiver requirement is met, the FOIA
 Officer shall consider the following factors:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e360829" >(i) 
 <i>The existence and magnitude of a
 commercial interest
 </i>: whether the requester
 has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the
 requested disclosure. The FOIA Officer shall consider any
 commercial interest of the requester (with reference to
 the definition of “commercial use request” in paragraph
 (b)(1) of this section), or of any person on whose behalf
 the requester may be acting, that would be furthered by
 the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an
 opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding
 this consideration.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360835" >(ii) 
 <i>The primary interest in
 disclosure:
 </i> whether any identified commercial
 interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in
 comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that
 disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the
 requester.” A fee waiver or reduction is justified if the
 public interest standard (paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this
 section) is satisfied and the public interest is greater
 than any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The
 FOIA Officer ordinarily shall presume that if a news media
 requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the
 public interest is the primary interest served by
 disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers
 or others who merely compile and market Government
 information for direct economic return shall not be
 presumed to primarily serve the public
 interest.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360841" >(4) If only some
 of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a fee
 waiver, a waiver shall be granted for those
 records.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360845" >(5) Requests for
 the waiver or reduction of fees should address the factors
 listed in paragraphs (k)(2) and (3) of this section, insofar as
 they apply to each request.

 <li id="d0e360864" >(a) The purpose of
 this subpart is to establish policies and procedures for implementing
 the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a) (the Act). The
 main objectives are to facilitate full exercise of rights conferred on
 individuals under the Act and to ensure the protection of privacy as
 to individuals on whom USPTO maintains records in systems of records
 under the Act. USPTO accepts the responsibility to act promptly and in
 accordance with the Act upon receipt of any inquiry, request or appeal
 from a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for
 permanent residence into the United States, regardless of the age of
 the individual. Further, USPTO accepts the obligations to maintain
 only such information on individuals as is relevant and necessary to
 the performance of its lawful functions, to maintain that information
 with such accuracy, relevancy, timeliness, and completeness as is
 reasonably necessary to assure fairness in determinations made by
 USPTO about the individual, to obtain information from the individual
 to the extent practicable, and to take every reasonable step to
 protect that information from unwarranted disclosure. USPTO will
 maintain no record describing how an individual exercises rights
 guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by
 statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or
 unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law
 enforcement activity. An individual’s name and address will not be
 sold or rented by USPTO unless such action is specifically authorized
 by law; however, this provision shall not be construed to require the
 withholding of names and addresses otherwise permitted to be made
 public.

 </li>
 <li id="d0e360894" >(d) Any request for

 individual but does not know which system of records might contain
 such a record, the USPTO Privacy Officer will provide assistance in
 person or by mail.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e360984" >(b) Inquiries
 submitted by mail should include the words “PRIVACY ACT INQUIRY” in
 capital letters at the top of the letter and on the face of the

 reserves the right to require compliance with the identification
 procedures appearing at §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e361069">102.24(d)</a> where circumstances warrant. If the
 inquiry is a request that USPTO determine whether it has, in a given

 is not addressed as specified in paragraph (a) of this section or
 which is not marked as specified in paragraph (b) of this section will
 be so addressed and marked by USPTO personnel and forwarded
 immediately to the Privacy Officer. An inquiry which is not properly
 addressed by the individual will not be deemed to have been “received”
 for purposes of measuring the time period for response until actual
 receipt by the Privacy Officer. In each instance when an inquiry so
 forwarded is received, the Privacy Officer shall notify the individual
 that his or her inquiry was improperly addressed and the date the
 inquiry was received at the proper address.

 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e361047" >(1) Each inquiry
 received shall be acted upon promptly by the Privacy Officer.
 Every effort will be made to respond within ten working days
 (
 <i>i.e.,</i> excluding
 Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) of the date of
 receipt. If a response cannot be made within ten working days,
 the Privacy Officer shall send an acknowledgment during that
 period providing information on the status of the inquiry and
 asking for such further information as may be necessary to
 process the inquiry. The first correspondence sent by the
 Privacy Officer to the requester shall contain USPTO’s control
 number assigned to the request, as well as a note that the
 requester should use that number in all future contacts in order
 to facilitate processing. USPTO shall use that control number in

 </li>
 <li id="d0e361054" >(2) If the
 Privacy Officer fails to send an acknowledgment within ten
 working days, as provided above, the requester may ask the
 General Counsel to take corrective action. No failure of the

 administrative finality for purposes of judicial
 review.

 should be taken of the fact that certain agencies are responsible for
 publishing notices of systems of records having Government-wide
 application to other agencies, including USPTO. The agencies known to
 be publishing these general notices and the types of records covered
 therein appear in an appendix to this part. The provisions of this
 section, and particularly paragraph (a) of this section, should be
 followed in making inquiries with respect to such records. Such
 records in USPTO are subject to the provisions of this part to the
 extent indicated in the appendix to this part. The exemptions, if any,
 determined by an agency publishing a general notice shall be invoked
 and applied by USPTO after consultation, as necessary, with that other
 agency.

 lawfully admitted for permanent residence into the United States may
 submit a request for access to records to USPTO. The request should be

 Street, Alexandria, Virginia, or by mail addressed to the Privacy
 Officer, United States Patent and Trademark Office, P.O. Box 1450,
 Alexandria, Virginia 22313-1450.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e361081" >(b) Requests submitted
 by mail should include the words “PRIVACY ACT REQUEST” in capital
 letters at the top of the letter and on the face of the envelope. Any
 request which is not addressed as specified in paragraph (a) of this
 section or which is not marked as specified in this paragraph will be
 so addressed and marked by USPTO personnel and forwarded immediately
 to the Privacy Officer. A request which is not properly addressed by
 the individual will not be deemed to have been “received” for purposes
 of measuring time periods for response until actual receipt by the

 <li id="d0e361085" >(c) If the request
 follows an inquiry under §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e360968">102.23</a> in connection with which the
 individual’s identity was established by USPTO, the individual need
 only indicate the record to which access is sought, provide the USPTO
 control number assigned to the request, and sign and date the request.
 If the request is not preceded by an inquiry under §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e360968">102.23</a> , the procedures of this section should
 be followed.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e361095" >(d) The requirements
 for identification of individuals seeking access to records are as
 follows:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e361099" >(1) 
 <i>In person</i>. Each individual
 making a request in person shall be required to present
 satisfactory proof of identity. The means of proof, in the order
 of preference and priority, are:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e361105" >(i) A
 document bearing the individual’s photograph (for example,
 driver’s license, passport or military or civilian
 identification card);
 </li>
 <li id="d0e361109" >(ii) A
 document, preferably issued for participation in a
 federally sponsored program, bearing the individual’s
 signature (for example, unemployment insurance book,
 employer’s identification card, national credit card, and
 professional, craft or union membership card);
 and
 </li>
 <li id="d0e361113" >(iii) A
 document bearing neither the photograph nor the signature
 of the individual, preferably issued for participation in
 a federally sponsored program (for example, Medicaid
 card). In the event the individual can provide no suitable
 documentation of identity, USPTO will require a signed
 statement asserting the individual’s identity and
 stipulating that the individual understands the penalty
 provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3) recited in § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e361870">102.32(a)</a>. In order to avoid any
 unwarranted disclosure of an individual’s records, USPTO
 reserves the right to determine the adequacy of proof of
 identity offered by any individual, particularly when the
 request involves a sensitive record.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e361120" >(2) 
 <i>Not in person</i>. If the
 individual making a request does not appear in person before the
 Privacy Officer or other employee authorized to determine
 identity, a certification of a notary public or equivalent
 officer empowered to administer oaths must accompany the request
 under the circumstances prescribed in §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e360968">102.23(b)(9)</a>. The certification in or
 attached to the letter must be substantially in accordance with

 <i>Parents of minors and legal
 guardians
 </i>. An individual acting as the parent of a
 minor or the legal guardian of the individual to whom a record
 pertains shall establish his or her personal identity in the
 same manner prescribed in either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of
 this section. In addition, such other individual shall establish
 his or her identity in the representative capacity of parent or
 legal guardian. In the case of the parent of a minor, the proof
 of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the
 minor’s birth certificate. In the case of a legal guardian of an
 individual who has been declared incompetent due to physical or
 mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction,
 the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy
 of the court’s order. For purposes of the Act, a parent or legal
 guardian may represent only a living individual, not a decedent.
 A parent or legal guardian may be accompanied during personal
 access to a record by another individual, provided the
 provisions of §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e361164">102.25(f)</a> are satisfied.

 <li id="d0e361245" >(i) Inspection in person may be had in a location specified
 by the Privacy Officer during business
 hours;

 <li id="d0e361249" >(ii) Transfer of records to a Federal facility more convenient
 to the individual may be arranged, but only if the Privacy
 Officer determines that a suitable facility is available,
 that the individual’s access can be properly supervised at
 that facility, and that transmittal of the records to that
 facility will not unduly interfere with operations of
 USPTO or involve unreasonable costs, in terms of both
 money and manpower; and
 </li>
 <li id="d0e361253" >(iii) Copies
 may be mailed at the request of the individual, subject to
 payment of the fees prescribed in §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e361841">102.31</a>. USPTO, on its own initiative,
 may elect to provide a copy by mail, in which case no fee
 will be charged the individual.
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li id="d0e361260" >(c) Access to medical

 <li id="d0e361271" >(e) USPTO reserves the
 right to limit access to copies and abstracts of original records,
 rather than the original records. This election would be appropriate,
 for example, when the record is in an automated data media such as
 tape or diskette, when the record contains information on other
 individuals, and when deletion of information is permissible under
 exemptions (for example, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)). In no event shall
 original records of USPTO be made available to the individual except
 under the immediate supervision of the Privacy Officer or the Privacy
 Officer’s designee.

 the presence of the other individual in writing. The authorization
 shall include the name of the other individual, a specific description
 of the record to which access is sought, the USPTO control number
 assigned to the request, the date, and the signature of the individual
 to whom the record pertains. The other individual shall sign the

 <i>Administrative review</i>. When
 an initial denial of a request is issued by the Privacy Officer,
 the individual’s opportunities for further consideration shall
 be as follows:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e361352" >(i) As to
 denial under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, two
 opportunities for further consideration are available in
 the alternative:
 <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
 <li id="d0e361356" >(A) If the individual contests the application of the
 exemption to the records, review procedures in § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e361164">102.25(g)(3)(ii)</a> shall apply;
 or
 </li>
 <li id="d0e361363" >(B) If the individual challenges the exemption itself,
 the procedure is a petition for the issuance,
 amendment, or repeal of a rule under 5 U.S.C.
 553(e). If the exemption was determined by USPTO,
 such petition shall be filed with the General
 Counsel. If the exemption was determined by another
 agency (as described in § 
 <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e360968">102.23(f)</a> ), USPTO will provide
 the individual with the name and address of the
 other agency and any relief sought by the individual
 shall be that provided by the regulations of the
 other agency. Within USPTO, no such denial is
 administratively final until such a petition has
 been filed by the individual and disposed of on the
 merits by the General Counsel.

 the Privacy Officer’s initial denial notification. The
 procedures appearing in §  <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e361487">102.28</a> shall be followed by both the individual and USPTO to the
 maximum extent practicable.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e361377" >(iii) As to
 denial under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, no
 further administrative consideration within USPTO is
 available because the denial is not administratively final
 until expiration of the time period indicated in § <a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e361391">102.26(a)</a>.

 lawfully admitted for permanent residence into the United States may
 submit a request for correction or amendment to USPTO. The request
 should be made either in person or by mail addressed to the Privacy
 Officer who processed the individual’s request for access to the
 record, and to whom is delegated authority to make initial
 determinations on requests for correction or amendment. The office of
 the Privacy Officer is open to the public between the hours of 9 a.m.
 and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday (excluding legal public
 holidays).
 </li>

 so addressed and marked by USPTO personnel and forwarded immediately
 to the Privacy Officer. A request which is not properly addressed by
 the individual will not be deemed to have been “received” for purposes
 of measuring the time period for response until actual receipt by the
 Privacy Officer. In each instance when a request so forwarded is
 received, the Privacy Officer shall notify the individual that his or
 her request was improperly addressed and the date the request was
 received at the proper address.

 individual’s record is corrected or amended pursuant to a request by
 that individual, the Privacy Officer shall be responsible for
 notifying all persons and agencies to which the corrected or amended
 portion of the record had been disclosed prior to its correction or
 amendment, if an accounting of such disclosure required by the Act was
 made. The notification shall require a recipient agency maintaining
 the record to acknowledge receipt of the notification, to correct or

 disclosed the record of the substance of the correction or
 amendment.

 </li>
 <li id="d0e361645" >(b) An appeal should

 Although the foregoing normally will comprise the entire record on
 appeal, the General Counsel may seek additional information necessary
 to assure that the final determination is fair and equitable and, in
 such instances, disclose the additional information to the individual
 to the greatest extent possible, and provide an opportunity for
 comment thereon.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e361653" >(d) No personal

 the General Counsel may extend the thirty days upon deciding that a
 fair and equitable review cannot be made within that period, but only
 if the individual is advised in writing of the reason for the
 extension and the estimated date by which a final determination will
 issue. The estimated date should not be later than the sixtieth
 working day after receipt of the appeal unless unusual circumstances,

 <li id="d0e361678" >(1) The right of
 the individual under the Act to file a concise statement of
 reasons for disagreeing with the final determination. The
 statement ordinarily should not exceed one page and USPTO
 reserves the right to reject a statement of excessive length.
 Such a statement shall be filed with the General Counsel. It
 should provide the USPTO control number assigned to the request,
 indicate the date of the final determination and be signed by
 the individual. The General Counsel shall acknowledge receipt of
 such statement and inform the individual of the date on which it
 was received.
 </li>
 <li id="d0e361682" >(2) The facts
 that any such disagreement statement filed by the individual
 will be noted in the disputed record, that the purposes and uses
 to which the statement will be put are those applicable to the

 will be provided to persons and agencies to which the record is

 <i>Investigative Records—Contract and Grant

 (e)(4) (A) through (F), (e) (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i).
 These exemptions are necessary to ensure the proper functions of the
 law enforcement activity, to protect confidential sources of
 information, to fulfill promises of confidentiality, to prevent
 interference with law enforcement proceedings, to avoid the disclosure
 of investigative techniques, to avoid the endangering of law
 enforcement personnel, to avoid premature disclosure of the knowledge

 actions, and to maintain the integrity of the law enforcement

 foregoing are exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d),
 (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f). The reasons for
 asserting the exemption are to prevent subjects of
 investigation from frustrating the investigatory process,
 to insure the proper functioning and integrity of law
 enforcement activities, to prevent disclosure of
 investigative techniques, to maintain the ability to
 obtain necessary information, to fulfill commitments made
 to sources to protect their identities and the
 confidentiality of information and to avoid endangering
 these sources and law enforcement personnel. Special note
 is taken of the fact that the proviso clause in this
 exemption imports due process and procedural protections
 for the individual. The existence and general character of
 the information exempted will be made known to the

 foregoing are exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d),

 asserting the exemption are to maintain the ability to
 obtain candid and necessary information, to fulfill
 commitments made to sources to protect the confidentiality
 of information, to avoid endangering these sources and,
 ultimately, to facilitate proper selection or continuance
 of the best applicants or persons for a given position or
 contract. Special note is made of the limitation on the
