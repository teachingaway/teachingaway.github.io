            <p id="d0e304555115">Whenever publication or
              disclosure by the publication of an application or by the grant of a patent on an
              invention in which the Government has a property interest might, in the opinion of the
              head of the interested Government agency, be detrimental to the national security, the
              Commissioner of Patents upon being so notified shall order that the invention be kept
              secret and shall withhold the publication of an application or the grant of a patent
              therefor under the conditions set forth hereinafter.

           </div>
           <p id="d0e3133">All provisional applications filed under
            <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302673">35
               U.S.C. 111(b)</a></b>, nonprovisional applications filed under
            <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302673">35&nbsp;U.S.C. 111(a)</a></b>, and international applications filed under the
            PCT, in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) are reviewed for the purposes of
            issuance of a foreign filing license pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e304599">35&nbsp;U.S.C. 184</a></b>. See also
            <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e337078">37 CFR
               5.1(b)</a></b>. These applications are screened upon receipt in the USPTO for
            subject matter that, if disclosed, might impact the national security. Such applications
            are referred to the appropriate agencies for consideration of restrictions on disclosure of
            the subject matter as provided for in <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e304551">35 U.S.C. 181</a></b>. 
           </p>
           <p id="d0e3155">If a defense agency concludes that
            disclosure of the invention would be detrimental to the national security, a secrecy order
            is recommended to the Commissioner for Patents. The Commissioner then issues a Secrecy
            Order and withholds the publication of the application or the grant of a patent for such
            period as the national interest requires. 
           </p>
           <p id="d0e3160">For those applications in which the
            Government has a property interest (including applications indicating national security
            classified subject matter), responsibility for notifying the Commissioner for Patents of
            the need for a Secrecy Order resides with the agency having that interest. Applications
            that are national security classified (see <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313866">37 CFR 1.9(i))</a></b> may be so
            indicated by use of authorized national security markings (e.g., “Confidential,” “Secret,”
            or “Top Secret”). National security classified documents filed in the USPTO must be either
            hand-carried to Licensing and Review or mailed to the Office in compliance with
            <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e337078">37 CFR
               5.1(a)</a></b> and Executive Order 13526 of December 29, 2009. However, the
            Office will accept such applications filed with the USPTO via the Department of Defense
            Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) and consider them as filed via the
            USPTO’s electronic filing system for purposes of <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e314702">37 CFR 1.16(t)</a></b> and <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e328182">37 CFR
               1.445(a)(ii)</a></b>. As set forth in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e337078">37 CFR 5.1(d)</a></b>, the
            applicant in a national security classified patent application must obtain a secrecy order
            from the appropriate defense agency or provide authority to cancel the markings. A list of
            contacts at the appropriate defense agency can be obtained by contacting Licensing and
            Review.
           </p>
           <p id="d0e3179">A second purpose for the screening of all
            applications, with an exception for provisional applications, is to identify inventions in
            which DOE or NASA might have property rights. See 42 U.S.C. 2182, 51 U.S.C. 20135, and
            <b><a href="s150.html#d0e4343">MPEP §
               150</a></b>.
           </p>
           <p id="d0e3185">A third function of the screening
            procedure is to process foreign filing license petitions under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e337427">37 CFR
               5.12(a)</a></b>. See <b><a href="s140.html#d0e3682">MPEP § 140</a></b>.
           </p>
           <p id="d0e3194">Provisional applications filed in a
            foreign language are also screened under these provisions. The Office will make an attempt
            to determine the subject matter of the application, but the applicant may be required to
            provide at least an English language abstract of the information for screening purposes. It
            is strongly recommended that if the applicant is in possession of an English language
            description of the technology, it should be filed with the provisional application to
            prevent screening delays.
           </p>
           <p id="d0e3200">All applications are required to be
            cleared from secrecy review before forwarding to issue. If the L&amp;R code on the general
            information display does not equal 1, then in an IFW application, a message should be sent
            to LREVINCOMINGDOCS. 
           </p>
           <p id="d0e3206">The Patent Application Locating and
            Monitoring (PALM) System's general information display discloses the current Licensing and
            Review status as well as the historical status. The indicator “L&amp;R code” displays the
            current status of the application while the indicators “Third Level Review” and “Secrecy
            Order” display the historical status of the application. An L&amp;R code of “3” or a “Third
            Level Review” of “Yes” indicates that application is/has been considered for security
            screening.
           </p>
           <p id="d0e3210">An L&amp;R code of “4” indicates that
            application is currently under Secrecy Order. In this case, the application has been
            converted to a paper application file and there should be no images maintained in the Image
            File Wrapper system (IFW).
           </p>
           <p id="d0e3214">While the initial screening is performed
            only by designated personnel, all examiners have a responsibility to be alert for obviously
            sensitive subject matter either in the original disclosure or subsequently introduced, for
            example, by amendment. If the examiner is aware of subject matter which should be subject
            to screening by appropriate office personnel, this should be brought to the attention of
            Licensing and Review, to any of the supervisory patent examiners (SPEs) of Technology
            Center Working Group 3640.
