                        identified a number of rationales to support a conclusion of obviousness which are
                        consistent with the proper “functional approach” to the determination of obviousness as
                        laid down in <i>Graham</i>. The key to supporting any
                        rejection under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450">35 U.S.C. 103</a></b> is the clear articulation
                        of the reason(s) why the claimed invention would have been obvious. The Supreme Court in
                        <i>KSR</i> noted that the analysis supporting a rejection
                        under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450">35
                              U.S.C. 103</a></b> should be made explicit. In <i>Ball Aerosol v. Ltd.
                           Brands,</i> 555 F.3d 984, 89 USPQ2d 1870 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the Federal Circuit
                        offered additional instruction as to the need for an explicit analysis. The Federal Circuit
                        explained that the Supreme Court’s requirement for an explicit analysis does not require
                        record evidence of an explicit teaching of a motivation to combine in the prior
                        art.
                     </p>
                     <p id=""> "[T]he analysis that "should be made explicit" refers not to the teachings in
                        the prior art of a motivation to combine, but to the court’s analysis. . . . Under the
                        flexible inquiry set forth by the Supreme Court, the district court therefore erred by
                        failing to take account of 'the inferences and creative steps,' or even routine steps, that
                        an inventor would employ and by failing to find a motivation to combine related pieces from
                        the prior art." <i>Ball Aerosol,</i> 555 F.3d at 993, 89 USPQ2d at 1877.

                     <p id="">The Federal Circuit’s directive in <i>Ball Aerosol</i> was
                        addressed to a lower court, but it applies to Office personnel as well. When setting forth
                        a rejection, Office personnel are to continue to make appropriate findings of fact as
                        explained in <b><a href="s2141.html#d0e208143">MPEP §

                        explanation as to why the invention as claimed would have been obvious to a person of
                        ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention. This requirement for explanation
                        remains even in situations in which Office personnel may properly rely on intangible
                        realities such as common sense and ordinary ingenuity.

                                 163 USPQ 673 (1969) was a paving machine which combined several well-known
                                 elements onto a single chassis. Standard prior art paving machines typically
                                 combined equipment for spreading and shaping asphalt onto a single chassis. The

                                 the side of the paver for the purpose of preventing cold joints during continuous
                                 strip paving. The prior art used radiant heat for softening the asphalt to make
                                 patches, but did not use radiant heat burners to achieve continuous strip paving.

                                 single chassis. The Court found that the operation of the heater was in no way
                                 dependent on the operation of the other equipment, and that a separate heater
                                 could also be used in conjunction with a standard paving machine to achieve the
                                 same results. The Court concluded that “[t]he convenience of putting the burner
                                 together with the other elements in one machine, though perhaps a matter of great
                                 convenience, did not produce a ‘new’ or ‘different function’” and that to those
                                 skilled in the art the use of the old elements in combination would have been
                                 obvious. <i>Id.</i> at 60, 163 USPQ at 674.

                                 an argument to combine prior art elements. The invention involved applying enteric
                                 coatings to a drug in pill form for the purpose of ensuring that the drug did not
                                 disintegrate before reaching its intended site of action. The drug at issue was
                                 omeprazole, the generic name for gastric acid inhibitor marketed as Prilosec®. The
                                 claimed formulation included two layers of coatings over the active ingredient. 
                              </p>
                              <p id="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0b2_10b">The district court found that Astra’s
                                 patent in suit was infringed by defendants Apotex and Impax. The district court
                                 rejected Apotex’s defense that the patents were invalid for obviousness. Apotex
                                 had argued that the claimed invention was obvious because coated omeprazole
                                 tablets were known from a prior art reference, and because secondary subcoatings
                                 in pharmaceutical preparations generally were also known. There was no evidence of
                                 unpredictability associated with applying two different enteric coatings to
                                 omeprazole. However, Astra’s reason for applying an intervening subcoating between
                                 the prior art coating and omeprazole had been that the prior art coating was
                                 actually interacting with omeprazole, thereby contributing to undesirable
                                 degradation of the active ingredient. This degradation of omeprazole by
                                 interaction with the prior art coating had not been recognized in the prior art.
                                 Therefore, the district court reasoned that based on the evidence available, a
                                 person of ordinary skill in the art would have had no reason to include a
                                 subcoating in an omeprazole pill formulation.

                                 district court’s decision that the claimed invention was not obvious. Even though
                                 subcoatings for enteric drug formulation were known, and there was no evidence of
                                 undue technical hurdles or lack of a reasonable expectation of success, the
                                 formulation was nevertheless not obvious because the flaws in the prior art

                                 known, successfully marketed formulation. The proposed modification thus amounted
                                 to extra work and greater expense for no apparent reason. This is not the same as

                                 product obtained according to the proposed modifications would merely have been

                                 analyzed in view of the discovery of a previously unknown problem by the patentee.
                                 If the adverse interaction between active agent and coating had been known, it
                                 might well have been obvious to use a subcoating. However, since the problem had
                                 not been previously known, there would have been no reason to incur additional
                                 time and expense to add another layer, even though the addition would have been

                                 which a one-piece molded foam base section formed the top of the shoe (the upper)
                                 and the sole. A strap also made of foam was attached to the foot opening of the

                                 heel strap was constantly in contact with the wearer’s foot. In the claimed
                                 footwear, the foam heel strap contacted the wearer’s foot only when needed to help
                                 reposition the foot properly in the shoe, thus reducing wearer discomfort that
                                 could arise from constant contact. This desirable feature was a result of the
                                 friction between the base section and the strap that kept the strap in place
                                 behind the Achilles portion of the wearer’s foot. The Federal Circuit pointed out
                                 that this combination “yielded more than predictable results.”

                                 friction between the base section and the strap was a problem rather than an
                                 advantage, and had suggested the use of nylon washers to reduce friction. Thus the

                                 taught by the prior art, the claims would not have been obvious because the
                                 combination yielded more than predictable results.

                              </p>
                              <p id="ch2100_d1b1a1_239bd_81">The court discussed two different sets
                                 of claims in <i>Wyers,</i> both drawn to improvements over the prior
                                 art hitch pin locks. The first improvement was a removable sleeve that could be
                                 placed over the shank of the hitch pin lock so that the same lock could be used
                                 with towing apertures of varying sizes. The second improvement was an external
                                 flat flange seal adapted to protect the internal lock mechanism from contaminants.
                                 Wyers had admitted that each of several prior art references taught every element
                                 of the claimed inventions except for the removable sleeve and the external
                                 covering. Master Lock had argued that these references, in combination with
                                 additional references teaching the missing elements, would have rendered the
                                 claims obvious. The court first addressed the question of whether the additional
                                 references relied on by Master Lock were analogous prior art. As to the reference
                                 teaching the sleeve improvement, the court concluded that it dealt specifically
                                 with using a vehicle to tow a trailer, and was therefore in the same field of
                                 endeavor as Wyers’ sleeve improvement. The reference teaching the sealing
                                 improvement dealt with a padlock rather than a lock for a tow hitch. The court
                                 noted that Wyers’ specification had characterized the claimed invention as being
                                 in the field of locking devices, thus at least suggesting that the sealed padlock
                                 reference was in the same field of endeavor. However, the court also observed that
                                 even if sealed padlocks were not in the same field of endeavor, they were
                                 nevertheless reasonably pertinent to the problem of avoiding contamination of a
                                 locking mechanism for tow hitches. The court explained that the Supreme Court’s
                                 decision in KSR “directs [it] to construe the scope of analogous art broadly.”
                                 <i>Id.</i> at 1238, 95 USPQ2d at 1530. For these reasons, the court
                                 found that Master Lock’s asserted references were analogous prior art, and
                                 therefore relevant to the obviousness inquiry.

                                 of whether there would have been adequate motivation to combine the prior art
                                 elements as had been urged by Master Lock. The court recalled the
                                 <i>Graham</i> inquiries, and also emphasized the “expansive and
                                 flexible” post-KSR approach to obviousness that must not “deny factfinders

                                 premium, and that removable sleeves addressed this economic concern. As to the
                                 sealing improvement, the court pointed out that both internal and external seals
                                 were well-known means to protect locks from contaminants. The court concluded that
                                 the constituent elements were being employed in accordance with their recognized
                                 functions, and would have predictably retained their respective functions when
                                 combined as suggested by Master Lock. The court cited <i>In re
                                    O’Farrell,</i> 853 F.2d 894, 904 (Fed. Cir. 1988) for the proposition

                                 (Fed. Cir. 2009), was directed to a polyaxial pedicle screw used in spinal
                                 surgeries that included a compression member for pressing a screw head against a
                                 receiver member. A prior art reference (Puno) disclosed all of the elements of the
                                 claim except for the compression member. Instead, the screw head in Puno was
                                 separated from the receiver member to achieve a shock absorber effect, allowing
                                 some motion between receiver member and the vertebrae. The missing compression
                                 member was readily found in another prior art reference (Anderson), which
                                 disclosed an external fracture immobilization splint for immobilizing long bones
                                 with a swivel clamp capable of polyaxial movement until rigidly secured by a
                                 compression member. It was asserted during trial that a person of ordinary skill
                                 would have recognized that the addition of Anderson’s compression member to Puno’s
                                 device would have achieved a rigidly locked polyaxial pedicle screw covered by the
                                 claim.

                              <p id="ch2100_d1b1a1_24b4d_134">In conducting its analysis, the Federal
                                 Circuit noted that the “predictable result” discussed in <i>KSR</i>
                                 refers not only to the expectation that prior art elements are capable of being
                                 physically combined, but also that the combination would have worked for its
                                 intended purpose. In this case, it was successfully argued that Puno “teaches
                                 away” from a rigid screw because Puno warned that rigidity increases the
                                 likelihood that the screw will fail within the human body, rendering the device
                                 inoperative for its intended purpose. In fact, the reference did not merely
                                 express a general preference for pedicle screws having a “shock absorber” effect,
                                 but rather expressed concern for failure and stated that the shock absorber
                                 feature “decrease[s] the chance of failure of the screw of the bone-screw
                                 interface” because “it prevent[s] direct transfer of load from the rod to the
                                 bone-screw interface.” Thus, the alleged reason to combine the prior art elements
                                 of Puno and Anderson—increasing the rigidity of the screw—ran contrary to the
                                 prior art that taught that increasing rigidity would result in a greater
                                 likelihood of failure. In view of this teaching and the backdrop of collective
                                 teachings of the prior art, the Federal Circuit determined that Puno teaches away
                                 from the proposed combination such that a person of ordinary skill would have been
                                 deterred from combining the references as proposed. Secondary considerations
                                 evaluated by the Federal Circuit relating to failure by others and copying also
                                 supported the view that the combination would not have been obvious at the time of
                                 the invention.

                                 follows a path from DNA to mRNA. Although the prior art Polisky article (authored
                                 by two of the three inventors of the application) had explicitly suggested
                                 employing the method described for protein synthesis, the inserted heterologous
                                 gene exemplified in the article was one that normally did not proceed all the way

                                 provide a force pushing the bed closed at all times. The dual-action spring
                                 reduced the force required to open the bed from the closed position, while

                                 focus on treadmills, but rather generally addressed problems of supporting the

                              <p id="ch2100_d1b1a1_24cbf_86">The court also considered whether one
                                 skilled in the art would have been led to combine the teachings of Damark and
                                 Teague. Appellant argued that Teague teaches away from the invention because it
                                 directs one skilled in the art not to use single-action springs and does not
                                 satisfy the claim limitations as the dual-action springs would render the
                                 invention inoperable. The Federal Circuit considered these arguments and found
                                 that, while Teague at most teaches away from using single-action springs to
                                 decrease the opening force, it actually instructed that single-action springs
                                 provide the result desired by the inventors, which was to increase the opening
                                 force provided by gravity. As to inoperability, the claims were not limited to
                                 single-action springs and were so broad as to encompass anything that assists in
                                 stably retaining the tread base, which is the function that Teague accomplished.
                                 Additionally, the fact that the counterweight mechanism from Teague used a large
                                 spring, which appellant argued would overpower the treadmill mechanism, ignores
                                 the modifications that one skilled in the art would make to a device borrowed from
                                 the prior art. One skilled in the art would size the components from Teague
                                 appropriately for the application.

                                 claims were drawn to the 5(S) stereoisomer of the blood pressure drug ramipril in
                                 stereochemically pure form, and to compositions and methods requiring 5(S)
                                 ramipril. The 5(S) stereoisomer is one in which all five stereocenters in the
                                 ramipril molecule are in the S rather than the R configuration. A mixture of
                                 various stereoisomers including 5(S) ramipril had been taught by the prior art.
                                 The question before the court was whether the purified single stereoisomer would
                                 have been obvious over the known mixture of stereoisomers.

                                 with enhanced therapeutic efficacy. For example, when all of the stereocenters
                                 were in the S form in the related drug enalapril (SSS enalapril) as compared with
                                 only two stereocenters in the S form (SSR enalapril), the therapeutic potency was
                                 700 times as great. There was also evidence to indicate that conventional methods
                                 could be used to separate the various stereoisomers of ramipril.

                                 lansoprazole was useful for the same indications as rabeprazole, and differed from

                                 rejection of a claimed compound that is useful as a drug might be made beginning
                                 with an inactive compound, if, for example, the reasons for modifying a prior art
                                 compound to arrive at the claimed compound have nothing to do with pharmaceutical
                                 activity. The inactive compound would not be considered to be a lead compound by
                                 pharmaceutical chemists, but could potentially be used as such when considering
                                 obviousness. Office personnel might also base an obviousness rejection on a known
                                 compound that pharmaceutical chemists would not select as a lead compound due to
                                 expense, handling issues, or other business considerations. However, there must be
                                 some reason for starting with that lead compound other than the mere fact that the

                                 selected as a lead compound. Rather, the Federal Circuit reasoned that, if 2-pyr

                                 even if a <i>prima facie</i> case of obviousness had been established,
                                 sufficient evidence of unexpected results was introduced to rebut such a showing.
                                 At trial, the witnesses consistently testified that the properties of risedronate
                                 were not expected, offering evidence that researchers did not predict either the
                                 potency or the low dose at which the compound was effective. Tests comparing
                                 risedronate to a compound in the prior art reference showed that risedronate
                                 outperformed the other compound by a substantial margin, could be administered in
                                 a greater amount without an observable toxic effect, and was not lethal at the
                                 same levels as the other compound. The weight of the evidence and the credibility
                                 of the witnesses were sufficient to show unexpected results that would have
                                 rebutted an obviousness determination. Thus, nonobviousness can be shown when a
                                 claimed invention is shown to have unexpectedly superior properties when compared
                                 to the prior art.

                                 of commercial success of risedronate and the evidence that risedronate met a long
                                 felt need. The court pointed out that little weight was to be afforded to the
                                 commercial success because the competing product was also assigned to Procter
                                 &amp; Gamble. However, the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s
                                 conclusion that risedronate met a long-felt, but unsatisfied need. The court
                                 rejected Teva’s contention that because the competing drug was available before
                                 Actonel7, there was no unmet need that the invention satisfied. The court
                                 emphasized that whether there was a long-felt but unsatisfied need is to be

                                 compound cases do not stand for the proposition that identification of a single

                                 For example, one might envision a suggestion in the prior art to formulate a
                                 compound having certain structurally defined moieties, or moieties with certain
                                 properties. If a person of ordinary skill would have known how to synthesize such
                                 a compound, and the structural and/or functional result could reasonably have been
                                 predicted, then a <i>prima facie</i> case of obviousness of the
                                 claimed chemical compound might exist even without identification a particular
                                 lead compound. As a second example, it could be possible to view a claimed
                                 compound as consisting of two known compounds attached via a chemical linker. The
                                 claimed compound might properly be found to have been obvious if there would have
                                 been a reason to link the two, if one of ordinary skill would have known how to do
                                 so, and if the resulting compound would have been the predictable result of the
                                 linkage procedure. Thus, Office personnel should recognize that in certain
                                 situations, it may be proper to reject a claimed chemical compound as obvious even

                                 processing equipment and computer software in the banking industry was that banks
                                 routinely did much of the record-keeping automatically. In routine check
                                 processing, the system read any magnetic ink characters identifying the account
                                 and routing. The system also read the amount of the check and then printed that
                                 value in a designated area of the check. The check was then sent through a further
                                 data processing step which used the magnetic ink information to generate the
                                 appropriate records for transactions and for posting to the appropriate accounts.
                                 These systems included generating periodic statements for each account, such as
                                 the monthly statement sent to checking account customers.

                                 deposit slip) which will be read, converted into a magnetic ink imprint, and then
                                 processed in the data system to include the category code. This enabled reporting
                                 of data by category as opposed to only allowing reporting by account number.

                                 technique from the prior art – the use of account numbers (generally used to track
                                 an individual's total transactions) to solve the problem of how to track
                                 categories of expenditures to more finely account for a budget. That is, account
                                 numbers (identifying data capable of processing in the automatic data processing
                                 system) were used to distinguish between different customers. Furthermore, banks
                                 have long segregated debits attributable to service charges within any given
                                 separate account and have rendered their customers subtotals for those charges.
                                 Previously, one would have needed to set up separate accounts for each category
                                 and thus receive separate reports. Supplementing the account information with
                                 additional digits (the category codes) solved the problem by effectively creating
                                 a single account that can be treated as distinct accounts for tracking and
                                 reporting services. That is, the category code merely allowed what might
                                 previously have been separate accounts to be handled as a single account, but with
                                 a number of sub-accounts indicated in the report.

                                 precisely to the use of either a normal pill or an enteric-coated pill.

                                 clopidogrel, which is the dextrorotatory isomer of methyl alpha-
                                 5(4,5,6,7-tetrahydro(3,2-c)thienopyridyl)(2-chlorophenyl)-acetate. Clopidogrel is
                                 an anti-thrombotic compound used to treat or prevent heart attack or stroke. The
                                 racemate, or mixture of dextrorotatory and levorotatory (D- and L-) isomers of the
                                 compound, was known in the prior art. The two forms had not previously been

                                    facie</i> obvious over the known racemate. However, in view of the
                                 evidence of unpredicted therapeutic advantages of the D-isomer presented in the
                                 case, the district court found that any <i>prima facie</i> case of
                                 obviousness had been overcome. At trial, the experts for both parties testified
                                 that persons of ordinary skill in the art could not have predicted the degree to
                                 which the isomers would have exhibited different levels of therapeutic activity
                                 and toxicity. Both parties’ experts also agreed that the isomer with greater
                                 therapeutic activity would most likely have had greater toxicity. Sanofi witnesses
                                 testified that Sanofi’s own researchers had believed that the separation of the
                                 isomers was unlikely to have been productive, and experts for both parties agreed
                                 that it was difficult to separate isomers at the time of the invention.
                                 Nevertheless, when Sanofi ultimately undertook the task of separating the isomers,
                                 it found that they had the “rare characteristic of ‘absolute stereoselectivity,’”
                                 whereby the D-isomer provided all of the favorable therapeutic activity but no
                                 significant toxicity, while the L-isomer produced no therapeutic activity but
                                 virtually all of the toxicity. Based on this record, the district court concluded
                                 that Apotex had not met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence

                                 art fan blades from rearward to forward sweep, in order to reduce endwall shock.
                                 The Federal Circuit disagreed with United’s assessment that the claimed fan blade
                                 would have been obvious based on an obvious to try rationale. The Federal Circuit
                                 pointed out that in a proper obvious to try approach to obviousness, the possible
                                 options for solving a problem must have been “known and finite.”

                                 which adjusted the throttle based on the travel of the pedal from a set position.
                                 The throttle controlled the combustion process and the available power generated
                                 by the engine. Newer cars used computer controlled throttles in which a sensor
                                 detected the motion of the pedal and sent signals to the engine to adjust the
                                 throttle accordingly. At the time of the invention, the marketplace provided a
                                 strong incentive to convert mechanical pedals to electronic pedals, and the prior
                                 art taught a number of methods for doing so. The prior art (Asano) taught an
                                 adjustable pedal with a fixed pivot point with mechanical throttle control. The
                                 prior art (‘936 patent to Byler) taught an electronic pedal sensor which was
                                 placed on a pivot point in the pedal assembly and that it was preferable to detect
                                 the pedal’s position in the pedal mechanism rather than in the engine. The prior
                                 art (Smith) taught that to prevent the wires connecting the sensor to the computer
                                 from chafing and wearing out, the sensor should be put on a fixed part of the
                                 pedal assembly rather than in or on the pedal’s footpad. The prior art (Rixon)
                                 taught an adjustable pedal assembly (sensor in the footpad) with an electronic
                                 sensor for throttle control. There was no prior art electronic throttle control
                                 that was combined with a pedal assembly which kept the pivot point fixed when
                                 adjusting the pedal.

                              “pointing”) orientation was the “most desirable” configuration for the projections,
                              and (2) the prior art “taught away” by showing desirability of the “pointing

                              which need not be supported by a finding that the prior art suggested that the
