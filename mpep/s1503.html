                              lines in the drawings may be directed to only a portion of the article. However, the
                              title may not be directed to less than the claimed design shown in full lines in the
                              drawings. A title descriptive of the actual article aids the examiner in developing a
                              complete field of search of the prior art and further aids in the proper assignment
                              of new applications to the appropriate class, subclass, and patent examiner, and the
                              proper classification of the patent upon allowance of the application. It also helps
                              the public in understanding the nature and use of the article embodying the design
                              after the patent has been issued. For example, a broad title such as “Adapter Ring”
                              provides little or no information as to the nature and intended use of the article
                              embodying the design. If a broad title is used, the description of the nature and
                              intended use of the design may be incorporated into the preamble. Absent an amendment
                              requesting deletion of the description, it would be printed on any patent that would
                              issue.

                              must be taken into consideration. <i>In re Rosen</i>,

                              is considered necessary to show the environment in which the design is associated,
                              may be represented in the drawing by broken lines. This includes any portion of an
                              article in which the design is embodied or applied to that is not considered part of
                              the claimed design. <i>In re Zahn</i>, 617 F.2d 261, 204
                              USPQ 988 (CCPA 1980). Unclaimed subject matter may be shown in broken lines for the
                              purpose of illustrating the environment in which the article embodying the design is
                              used. Unclaimed subject matter must be described as forming no part of the claimed
                              design or of a specified embodiment thereof. A boundary line may be shown in broken
                              lines if it is not intended to form part of the claimed design. Applicant may choose
                              to define the bounds of a claimed design with broken lines when the boundary does not
                              exist in reality in the article embodying the design. It would be understood that the
                              claimed design extends to the boundary but does not include the boundary. When a
                              boundary line is introduced via amendment or in a continuation application, the
                              introduction of the boundary line must comply with the written description

                              written description requirement where they make explicit a boundary that already
                              exists, but was unclaimed in the original disclosure. <i>See Owens</i>,

                              application as originally filed, but it is clear from the design specification that
                              the boundary of the claimed design is a straight broken line connecting the ends of

                              importance in the design. <i>In re Blum</i>, 374 F.2d
                              904, 153 USPQ 177 (CCPA 1967). Broken lines may not be used to show hidden planes and
                              surfaces which cannot be seen through opaque materials. The use of broken lines
                              indicates that the environmental structure or the portion of the article depicted in
                              broken lines forms no part of the design, and is not to indicate the relative
                              importance of parts of a design.

                           <p id="d0e151601">In general, when broken lines are
                              used, they should not intrude upon or cross the showing of the claimed design and
                              should not be of heavier weight than the lines used in depicting the claimed design.
                              When broken lines cross over the full line showing of the claimed design and are
                              defined as showing environment, it is understood that the surface which lies beneath
                              the broken lines is part of the claimed design. When the broken lines crossing over
                              the design are defined as boundaries, it is understood that the area within the
                              broken lines is not part of the claimed design. Therefore, when broken lines are used
                              which cross over the full line showing of the design, it is critical that the
                              description of the broken lines in the specification explicitly identifies their
                              purpose so that the scope of the claim is clear. As it is possible that broken lines
                              with different purposes may be included in a single application, the description must
                              make a visual distinction between the two purposes; such as --The broken lines
                              immediately adjacent the shaded areas represent the bounds of the claimed design
                              while all other broken lines are directed to environment and are for illustrative
                              purposes only; the broken lines form no part of the claimed design.-- Where a broken
                              line showing of environmental structure must necessarily cross or intrude upon the
                              representation of the claimed design and obscures a clear understanding of the
                              design, such an illustration should be included as a separate figure in addition to
                              the other figures which fully disclose the subject matter of the design. Further,
                              surface shading should not be used on unclaimed subject matter shown in broken lines
                              to avoid confusion as to the scope of the claim.

                              <p id="fp-pt-d636e9"> Informal color photographs or drawings
                                 have been submitted for the purposes of obtaining a filing date. When formal drawings are
                                 submitted, any showing of color in a black and white drawing is limited to the symbols
                                 used to line a surface to show color (<b><a href="s608.html#d0e47639">MPEP § 608.02</a></b>). Lining entire surfaces
                                 of a design to show color(s) may interfere with a clear showing of the design as required
                                 by <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">35 U.S.C.
                                       112</a></b> because surface shading cannot be used simultaneously to
                                 define the contours of those surfaces. However, a surface may be partially lined for color
                                 with a description that the color extends across the entire surface; this technique would
                                 allow for the use of shading on the rest of the surface showing the contours of the design
                                 (<b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324205">37 CFR
                                       1.152</a></b>). In the alternative, a separate view, properly shaded to
                                 show the contours of the design but omitting the color(s), may be submitted if identified
                                 as shown only for clarity of illustration.

                                 may be identified for clarity):

                              <p id="fp-pt-d636e28">However, some designs disclosed in informal color photographs/drawings cannot be depicted in black and white drawings lined
                                 for color. For example, a design may include multiple shades of a single color which cannot be accurately represented by the
                                 single symbol for a specific color. Or, the color may be a shade other than a true primary or secondary color as represented
                                 by the drafting symbols and lining the drawing with one of the drafting symbols would not be an exact representation of the
                                 design as originally disclosed. In these situations, applicant may file a petition to accept formal color drawings or color
