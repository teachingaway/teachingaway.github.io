                              be raised by the examiner until a claim is found allowable.

                           the application thoroughly. The usual procedure is for the assistant examiner to explain
                           the invention and discuss the references which he or she regards as most pertinent. The
                           primary examiner may indicate the action to be taken, whether restriction or election of
                           species is to be required, or whether the claims are to be considered on their merits.
                           If action on the merits is to be given and claims rejected, the primary examiner may
                           indicate how the references are to be applied in any prior art rejection and explain the
                           basis for any non-prior art grounds of rejection. The primary examiner may authorize

                           103-465 amended <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303482">35 U.S.C. 154</a></b> to change the term of
                           a patent to 20 years measured from the filing date of the earliest U.S. application for
                           which benefit under <b><a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#d0e303023">35&nbsp;U.S.C. 120</a></b>, 121 or 365(c) is
                           claimed. The 20-year patent term applies to all utility and plant patents issued on
                           applications filed on or after June 8, 1995. Effective March 16, 2013, Public Law
                           112-196 amended Title 35 of the U.S. Code to change U.S. practice from a first to invent
                           system to a first inventor to file system. In certain circumstances, applicants may
                           cancel their benefit/priority claim by amending the specification to delete any
                           references to prior applications. Therefore, examiners should search all applications
                           based on the actual U.S. filing date of the application rather than on the filing date
                           of any parent U.S. application for which benefit is claimed or foreign application to
                           which priority is claimed. Examiners should cite&nbsp;of interest all material prior art
                           having an effective filing date after the filing date of the U.S. parent application or
                           the foreign priority application but before the actual filing date of the application
                           being examined.

                        <p id="d0e73508">Allowed applications should generally
                           contain a citation of pertinent prior art for printing in the patent, even if no claim
                           presented during the prosecution was considered unpatentable over such prior art. Only
                           in those instances where a proper search has not revealed any prior art relevant to the
                           claimed invention is it appropriate to send an application to issue with no art cited.
                           In the case where no prior art is cited, the examiner must indicate “None” on a form
                           PTO-892 and include it in the application file wrapper. Where references have been cited
                           during the prosecution of parent applications and a continuing application, having no
                           newly cited references, is ready for allowance, the cited references of the parent
                           applications should be listed on a form PTO-892. The form should then be placed in the
                           file of the continuing application. See <b><a href="s1302.html#d0e132508">MPEP § 1302.12</a></b>. In a

                           is not necessary to prepare a new form PTO-892 because the form from the parent
                           application is in the same file wrapper and will be used by the printer.

                        </h1>
                        <p id="d0e76210">Office actions are sometimes returned
                           to the Office because the United States Postal Service has not been able to deliver
                           them. Upon receipt of the returned Office action, the Technology Center (TC) technical
                           support staff will check the application file record to ensure that the Office action
                           was mailed to the correct correspondence address. If the Office action was <span class="Underline">not</span> mailed to the correct correspondence address, it
                           should be stamped “remailed” with the remailing date and mailed to the correct
                           correspondence address. The period running against the application begins with the date
                           of remailing. If the Office action was mailed to the correct correspondence address and
                           it was addressed to an attorney or agent, a letter along with a copy of the Office
                           action may be sent to the applicant, or the first named inventor if more than one
                           inventor is the applicant, informing the applicant of the returned action. The time
                           period for reply to the Office action will be restarted to run from the mailing date of
                           the letter informing applicant of the returned action .
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e76226">A copy of the letter and a copy of
                           the envelope should be added to the IFW. If the period dating from the remailing elapses
                           with no communication from applicant, the application is abandoned.
