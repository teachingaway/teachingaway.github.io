                        Cosmetic Act, but is approved under the Public Health Service Act; or to a situation where
                        approval is sought for use of a particular medical device with a specific drug product
                        which may require approval under more than a single provision of law. The product that
                        forms the basis of an application for patent term extension must be either a medical device
                        or a drug product; any extension will be granted based upon the review of the product as
                        either a medical device or a drug productit cannot be a combination of those separate
                        products. See the file history of U.S. Patent No. 4,428,744 for an example of the
                        application of this principle.
