                           assist Office personnel in their review of applications for compliance with the utility
                           requirement. The Guidelines do not alter the substantive requirements of
                           <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35

                           are they designed to obviate the examiner’s review of applications for compliance with
                           all other statutory requirements for patentability. The Guidelines do not constitute
                           substantive rulemaking and hence do not have the force and effect of law. Rejections
                           will be based upon the substantive law, and it is these rejections which are appealable.
                           Consequently, any perceived failure by Office personnel to follow these Guidelines is
                           neither appealable nor petitionable.

                                       subject matter (i.e., a process, machine, manufacture, composition of
                                       matter, or improvement thereof).

                                       utility. An invention has a well-established utility if (i) a person of
                                       ordinary skill in the art would immediately appreciate why the invention
                                       is useful based on the characteristics of the invention (e.g., properties
                                       or applications of a product or process), and (ii) the utility is
                                       specific, substantial, and credible.

                                 description to determine if the applicant has asserted for the claimed
                                 invention any specific and substantial utility that is
                                 credible:

                                       claimed invention is useful for any particular practical purpose (i.e.,
                                       it has a “specific and substantial utility”) and the assertion would be
                                       considered credible by a person of ordinary skill in the art, do not
                                       impose a rejection based on lack of utility.

                                             specific and substantial utility. This requirement excludes
                                             “throw-away,” “insubstantial,” or “nonspecific” utilities, such as
                                             the use of a complex invention as landfill, as a way of satisfying

                                             perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the
                                             disclosure and any other evidence of record (e.g., test data,

                                             printed publications) that is probative of the&nbsp;applicant’s
                                             assertions. An applicant need only provide one credible assertion

                                             satisfy the utility requirement.

                                       utility for the claimed invention made by the applicant is credible, and
                                       the claimed invention does not have a readily apparent well-established

                                          <li id="d0e198580" class="nobull">(ii) Provide evidence that one of ordinary

                                             and substantial utility was well-established at the time of filing.
                                             The examiner should review any subsequently submitted evidence of

                                       specific and substantial credible utility. Whenever possible, the
                                       examiner should provide documentary evidence regardless of publication

                                       books, or U.S. or foreign patents) to support the factual basis for the

                                       and substantial credible utility. If documentary evidence is not
                                       available, the examiner should specifically explain the scientific basis
                                       for his or her factual conclusions.

                           a declaration under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323552">37 CFR 1.132</a></b> or a patent or a

                           three purposes. First, <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b> limits an inventor to
                           ONE patent for a claimed invention. If more than one patent is sought, a patent
                           applicant will receive a statutory double patenting rejection for claims included in
                           more than one application that are directed to the same invention. See
                           <b><a href="s804.html#d0e98894"> MPEP §
                                 804</a></b>. Second, <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b> defines which
                           categories of inventions are eligible for patent protection. An invention that is not a
                           machine, an article of manufacture, a composition or a process cannot be patented. See
                           <i>Diamond</i><i>v.</i><i>Chakrabarty,</i> 447 U.S. 303, 206 USPQ 193 (1980);

                           Third <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b> serves to ensure that patents are granted on only
                           those inventions that are “useful.” This second purpose has a Constitutional footing —
                           Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution authorizes Congress to provide exclusive rights
                           to inventors to promote the “useful arts.” See <i>Carl Zeiss
                              Stiftung</i><i>v.</i><i>Renishaw PLC,</i> 945 F.2d 1173, 20 USPQ2d 1094 (Fed.
                           Cir. 1991). Thus, to satisfy the requirements of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b>, an
                           applicant must claim an invention that is statutory subject matter and must show that
                           the claimed invention is “useful” for some purpose either explicitly or implicitly.
                           Application of this latter element of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b> is
                           the focus of these guidelines.

                           is not apparent why the invention is “useful.” This can occur when an applicant fails to

                              an invention must be “useful.” Courts have recognized that the term “useful” used
                              with&nbsp;reference to the utility requirement can be a difficult term&nbsp;to define. <i>Brenner</i><i>v.</i><i>Manson,</i> 383 U.S. 519, 529, 148 USPQ 689, 693
                              (1966) (simple everyday word like “useful” can be “pregnant with ambiguity when
                              applied to&nbsp;the&nbsp;facts of life.”). Where an applicant has set forth a specific and
                              substantial utility, courts have been reluctant to uphold a rejection under

                              as to the nature of the specific and substantial utility was inaccurate. For example,

                                 that would be applicable to the broad class of the invention. Office personnel
                                 should distinguish between situations where an applicant has disclosed a specific
                                 use for or application of the invention and situations where the applicant merely
                                 indicates that the invention may prove useful without identifying with specificity
                                 why it <span class="Underline">is</span> considered useful. For example,
                                 indicating that a compound may be useful in treating unspecified disorders, or

                                 define a specific utility for the compound. See, e.g., <i>In re Kirk,</i> 376 F.2d 936, 153 USPQ 48 (CCPA 1967); <i>In re Joly,</i> 376&nbsp;F.2d 906, 153 USPQ 45 (CCPA 1967).
                                 Similarly, a claim to a polynucleotide whose use is disclosed simply as a “gene
                                 probe” or “chromosome marker” would not be considered to be <i>specific </i>in the absence of a disclosure of a
                                 specific DNA target. See <i>In re Fisher,</i> 421

                                 of diagnostic utility, such as diagnosing an unspecified disease, would ordinarily
                                 be insufficient absent a disclosure of what condition can be diagnosed. Contrast
                                 the situation where an applicant discloses a specific biological activity and
                                 reasonably correlates that activity to a disease condition. Assertions falling
                                 within the latter category are sufficient to identify a specific utility for the
                                 invention. Assertions that fall in the former category are insufficient to define
                                 a specific utility for the invention, especially if the assertion takes the form

                                 directed to expressed sequence tags (ESTs), which are short nucleotide sequences
                                 that can be used to discover what genes and downstream proteins are expressed in a
                                 cell. The court held that “the claimed ESTs can be used only to gain further
                                 information about the underlying genes and the proteins encoded for by those
                                 genes. The claimed ESTs themselves are not an end of [applicant’s] research
                                 effort, but only tools to be used along the way in the search for a practical
                                 utility…. [Applicant] does not identify the function for the underlying
                                 protein-encoding genes. Absent such identification, we hold that the claimed ESTs
                                 have not been researched and understood to the point of providing an immediate,
                                 well-defined, real world benefit to the public meriting the grant of a patent.”

                                 “substantial utility” defines a “real world” use. Utilities that require or
                                 constitute carrying out further research to identify or reasonably confirm a “real
                                 world” context of use are not substantial utilities. For example, both a
                                 therapeutic method of treating a known or newly discovered disease and an assay
                                 method for identifying compounds that themselves have a “substantial utility”
                                 define a “real world” context of use. An assay that measures the presence of a
                                 material which has a stated correlation to a predisposition to the onset of a
                                 particular disease condition would also define a “real world” context of use in
                                 identifying potential candidates for preventive measures or further monitoring. On
                                 the other hand, the following are examples of situations that require or

                                 they are useful in analyzing compounds). An assessment that focuses on whether an
                                 invention is useful only in a research setting thus does not address whether the
                                 invention is in fact “useful” in a patent sense. Instead, Office personnel must
                                 distinguish between inventions that have a specifically identified substantial
                                 utility and inventions whose asserted utility requires further research to
                                 identify or reasonably confirm. Labels such as “research tool,” “intermediate” or
                                 “for research purposes” are not helpful in determining if an applicant has
                                 identified a specific and substantial utility for the invention.

                              “inoperative” and therefore lacking in utility are rare, and rejections maintained
                              solely on this ground by a Federal court even rarer. In many of these cases, the
                              utility asserted by the applicant was thought to be “incredible in the light of the
                              knowledge of the art, or factually misleading” when initially considered by the
                              Office. <i>In re Citron,</i> 325 F.2d 248, 253, 139 USPQ
                              516, 520 (CCPA 1963). Other cases suggest that on initial evaluation, the Office
                              considered the asserted utility to be inconsistent with known scientific principles
                              or “speculative at best” as to whether attributes of the invention necessary to
                              impart the asserted utility were actually present in the invention. <i>In re Sichert,</i> 566 F.2d 1154, 196 USPQ 209 (CCPA 1977).
                              However cast, the underlying finding by the court in these cases was that, <span class="Underline">based on the factual record of the case</span>, it was clear
                              that the invention could not and did not work as the inventor claimed it did. Indeed,
                              the use of many labels to describe a single problem (e.g., a false assertion
                              regarding utility) has led to some of the confusion that exists today with regard to
                              a rejection based on the “utility” requirement. Examples of such cases include: an
                              invention asserted to change the taste of food using a magnetic field <i>(Fregeau</i><i>v.</i><i>Mossinghoff,</i> 776 F.2d 1034, 227 USPQ 848 (Fed.

                              Thus, in view of the rare nature of such cases, Office personnel should not label an
                              asserted utility “incredible,” “speculative” or otherwise unless it is clear that a
                              rejection based on “lack of utility” is proper.

                              requirement in the context of an interference proceeding. Bowler challenged the
                              patentability of the invention claimed by Nelson on the basis that&nbsp;Nelson had failed
                              to sufficiently and persuasively disclose in his application a practical utility for
                              the invention. Nelson had developed and claimed a class of synthetic prostaglandins
                              modeled on naturally occurring prostaglandins. Naturally occurring prostaglandins are
                              bioactive compounds that, at the time of Nelson’s application, had a recognized value
                              in pharmacology (e.g., the stimulation of uterine smooth muscle which resulted in
                              labor induction or abortion, the ability to raise or lower blood pressure, etc.). To
                              support the utility he identified in his disclosure, Nelson included in his
                              application the results of tests demonstrating the bioactivity of his new substituted
                              prostaglandins relative to the bioactivity of naturally occurring prostaglandins. The
                              court concluded that&nbsp;Nelson had satisfied the practical utility requirement in
                              identifying the synthetic prostaglandins as pharmacologically active compounds. In
                              reaching this conclusion, the court considered and rejected arguments advanced by
                              Bowler that attacked the evidentiary basis for Nelson’s assertions that the compounds
                              were pharmacologically active.

                           <p id="d0e199427">The claimed invention is the focus of the assessment of
                              whether an applicant has satisfied the utility requirement. Each claim (i.e., each
                              “invention”), therefore, must be evaluated on its own merits for compliance with all
                              statutory requirements. Generally speaking, however, a dependent claim will define an
                              invention that has utility if the independent claim from which the dependent claim
                              depends is drawn to the same statutory class of invention as the dependent claim and
                              the independent claim defines an invention having utility. An exception to this
                              general rule is where the utility specified for the invention defined in a dependent
                              claim differs from that indicated for the invention defined in the independent claim
                              from which the dependent claim depends. Where an applicant has established utility
                              for a species that falls within an identified genus of compounds, and presents a
                              generic claim covering the genus, as a general matter, that claim should be treated
                              as being sufficient under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b>. Only where it can
                              be established that other species clearly encompassed by the claim do not have
                              utility should a rejection be imposed on the generic claim. In such cases, the
                              applicant should be encouraged to amend the generic claim so as to exclude the
                              species that lack utility.

                           <p id="d0e199442">It is common and sensible for an applicant to identify
                              several specific utilities for an invention, particularly where the invention is a
                              product (e.g., a machine, an article of manufacture or a composition of matter).
                              However, regardless of the category of invention that is claimed (e.g., product or
                              process), an applicant need only make one credible assertion of specific utility for
                              the claimed invention to satisfy <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b> and

                                 (Fed. Cir. 1995). For obvious reasons of efficiency and in deference to an
                                 applicant’s understanding of his or her invention, when a statement of utility is
                                 evaluated, Office personnel should not begin by questioning the truth of the
                                 statement of utility. Instead, any inquiry must start by asking if there is any
                                 reason to question the truth of the statement of utility. This can be done by
                                 simply evaluating the logic of the statements made, taking into consideration any
                                 evidence cited by the applicant. If the asserted utility is credible (i.e.,
                                 believable based on the record or the nature of the invention), a rejection based
                                 on “lack of utility” is not appropriate. Clearly, Office personnel should not
                                 begin an evaluation of utility by assuming that an asserted utility is likely to
                                 be false, based on the technical field of the invention or for other general
                                 reasons.

                                 and reasoning in order to assess the truth of a statement. This means that if the

                              337 (CCPA1962). In <i>In re Citron,</i> the court held
                              that when an “alleged utility appears to be incredible in the light of the knowledge
                              of the art, or factually misleading, applicant must establish the asserted utility by
                              acceptable proof.” 325 F.2d at 253, 139 USPQ at 520. The court approved of the
                              board’s decision which affirmed the rejection under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35 U.S.C.

                              (emphasis in original). The court thus established a higher burden on the applicant
                              where the statement of use is incredible or misleading. In such a case, the examiner
                              should challenge the use and require sufficient evidence of operativeness. The
                              purpose of this authority is to enable an applicant to cure an otherwise defective
                              factual basis for the operability of an invention. Because this is a curative
                              authority (e.g., evidence is requested to enable an applicant to support an assertion
                              that is inconsistent with the facts of record in the application), Office personnel
                              should indicate not only why the factual record is defective in relation to the
                              assertions of the applicant, but also, where appropriate, what type of evidentiary
                              showing can be provided by the applicant to remedy the problem.

                              USPQ2d at 1441. As courts have stated, “it is clearly improper for the examiner to

                              and would seem to serve for nothing except perhaps to unduly burden the applicant.”

                              An applicant can establish this reasonable correlation by relying on statistically
                              relevant data documenting the activity of a compound or composition, arguments or
                              reasoning, documentary evidence (e.g., articles in scientific journals), or any
                              combination thereof. The applicant does not have to prove that a correlation exists
                              between a particular activity and an asserted therapeutic use of a compound as a

                              similarity to a compound known to have a particular therapeutic or pharmacological
                              utility as being supportive of an assertion of therapeutic utility for a

                              USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980), the claimed compounds were found to have utility based on a
                              finding of a&nbsp;close structural relationship to daunorubicin and doxorubicin and shared
                              pharmacological activity with those compounds, both of which were known to be useful
                              in cancer chemotherapy. The evidence of close structural similarity with the known
                              compounds was&nbsp;presented in conjunction with evidence demonstrating substantial
                              activity of the claimed compounds&nbsp;in animals customarily employed for screening
                              anticancer agents. Such evidence should be given appropriate weight in determining
                              whether one skilled in the art would find the asserted utility credible. Office
                              personnel should evaluate not only the existence of the structural relationship, but
                              also the reasoning used by the applicant or a declarant to explain why that
                              structural similarity is believed to be relevant to the applicant's assertion of
                              utility.

                              personnel must be able to carry their burden that there is no sound rationale for the
                              asserted utility even though experts designated by Congress to decide the issue have
                              come to an opposite conclusion. “FDA approval, however, is not a prerequisite for
                              finding a compound useful within the meaning of the patent laws.” <i>In re Brana,</i> 51 F.3d 1560, 34&nbsp;USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir.

                              The credibility of an asserted utility for treating a human disorder may be more
                              difficult to establish where current scientific understanding suggests that such a
                              task would be impossible. Such a determination has always required a good
                              understanding of the state of the art as of the time that the invention was made. For
                              example, prior to the 1980’s, there were a number of cases where an asserted use in
                              treating cancer in humans was viewed as “incredible.” <i>In re

                              Inter. 1981). The fact that there is no known cure for a disease, however, cannot
                              serve as the basis for a conclusion that such an invention lacks utility. Rather,
                              Office personnel must determine if the asserted utility for the invention is credible
                              based on the information disclosed in the application. Only those claims for which an
                              asserted utility is not <span class="Underline">credible</span> should be
                              rejected. In such cases, the Office should carefully review what is being claimed by
                              the applicant. An assertion that the claimed invention is useful in treating a
                              symptom of an incurable disease may be considered credible by a person of ordinary
                              skill in the art on the basis of a fairly modest amount of evidence or support. In
                              contrast, an assertion that the claimed invention will be useful in “curing” the
                              disease may require a significantly greater amount of evidentiary support to be
                              considered credible by a person of ordinary skill in the art. <i>In re Sichert,</i> 566 F.2d 1154, 196 USPQ 209 (CCPA 1977);

                           <p id="d0e200346">In these cases, it is important to note that the Food
                              and Drug Administration has promulgated regulations that enable a party to conduct
                              clinical trials for drugs used to treat life threatening and severely-debilitating
                              illnesses, even where no alternative therapy exists. See 21 CFR 312.80-88 (1994).
                              Implicit in these regulations is the recognition that experts qualified to evaluate
                              the effectiveness of therapeutics can and often do find a sufficient basis to conduct
                              clinical trials of drugs for incurable or previously untreatable illnesses. Thus,
                              affidavit evidence from experts in the art indicating that there is a reasonable
                              expectation of success, supported by sound reasoning, usually should be sufficient to
                              establish that such a utility is <span class="Underline">credible</span>.
