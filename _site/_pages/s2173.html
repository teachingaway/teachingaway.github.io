                        notice to the public of the boundaries of the inventive subject matter protected by a
                        patent grant fosters innovation and competitiveness. Accordingly, providing high quality
                        patents is one of the agency’s guiding principles. The Office recognizes that issuing
                        patents with clear and definite claim language is a key component to enhancing the quality
                        of patents and raising confidence in the patent process.

                        regards as his or her invention. In patent examining parlance, the claim language must be
                        “definite” to comply with<b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215">35 U.S.C. 112(b)</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.

                        provide a clear measure of what applicants regard as the invention so that it can be
                        determined whether the claimed invention meets all the criteria for patentability and
                        whether the specification meets the criteria of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5">35 U.S.C.

                     <p id=""> It is of utmost importance that patents issue with definite claims that
                        clearly and precisely inform persons skilled in the art of the boundaries of protected
                        subject matter. Therefore, claims that do not meet this standard must be rejected under

                        as indefinite. Such a rejection requires that the applicant respond by explaining why the
                        language is definite or by amending the claim, thus making the record clear regarding the
                        claim boundaries prior to issuance. As an indefiniteness rejection requires the applicant
                        to respond by explaining why the language is definite or by amending the claim, such
                        rejections must clearly identify the language that causes the claim to be indefinite and
                        thoroughly explain the reasoning for the rejection.

                           <p id="ch2100_d1b1a0_22e42_354">The first step to examining a claim to
                              determine if the language is definite is to fully understand the subject matter of
                              the invention disclosed in the application and to ascertain the boundaries of that
                              subject matter encompassed by the claim. During examination, a claim must be given
                              its broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification as it would
                              be interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art. Because the applicant has the
                              opportunity to amend claims during prosecution, giving a claim its broadest
                              reasonable interpretation will reduce the possibility that the claim, once issued,
                              will be interpreted more broadly than is justified. In re
                              <i>Yamamoto,</i> 740 F.2d 1569, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <i>In re
                                 Zletz,</i> 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (“During
                              patent examination the pending claims must be interpreted as broadly as their terms
                              reasonably allow.”). The focus of the inquiry regarding the meaning of a claim should
                              be what would be reasonable from the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art.

                              1640, 1644 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <i>In re Buszard,</i> 504 F.3d 1364, 84
                              USPQ2d 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In <i>Buszard,</i> the claim was directed
                              to a flame retardant composition comprising a flexible polyurethane foam reaction
                              mixture. <i>Buszard,</i> 504 F.3d at 1365, 84 USPQ2d at 1749. The Federal
                              Circuit found that the Board’s interpretation that equated a “flexible” foam with a
                              crushed “rigid” foam was not reasonable. <i>Id.,</i> at 1367, 84 USPQ2d
                              at 1751. Persuasive argument was presented that persons experienced in the field of
                              polyurethane foams know that a flexible mixture is different than a rigid foam
                              mixture. <i>Id.,</i> 504 F.3d at 1366, 84 USPQ2d at 1751. See

                           <p id="ch2100_d1b1a0_22e42_365">Under a broadest reasonable
                              interpretation, words of the claim must be given their plain meaning, unless such
                              meaning is inconsistent with the specification. The plain meaning of a term means the
                              ordinary and customary meaning given to the term by those of ordinary skill in the
                              art at the time of the invention. The ordinary and customary meaning of a term may be
                              evidenced by a variety of sources, including the words of the claims themselves, the
                              specification, drawings, and prior art. However, the best source for determining the
                              meaning of a claim term is the specification - the greatest clarity is obtained when
                              the specification serves as a glossary for the claim terms. The presumption that a
                              term is given its ordinary and customary meaning may be rebutted by the applicant by
                              clearly setting forth a different definition of the term in the specification.
                              <i>In re Morris,</i> 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1028 (Fed.

                              account definitions or other “enlightenment” contained in the written description);

                           <i>Orthokinetics,</i> a claim directed to a wheel chair included the
                           phrase “so dimensioned as to be insertable through the space between the doorframe of an
                           automobile and one of the seats thereof.” 806 F.2d at 1568, 1 USPQ2d at 1082. The court
                           found the phrase to be as accurate as the subject matter permits, since automobiles are
                           of various sizes. <i>Id.,</i> at 1576, 1 USPQ2d at 1088. “As long as those
                           of ordinary skill in the art realized the dimensions could be easily obtained, § 112, 2d
                           para. requires nothing more.” <i>Id.</i> Claim terms are typically given
                           their ordinary and customary meaning as understood by one of ordinary skill in the
                           pertinent art, and the generally understood meaning of particular terms may vary from
                           art to art. Therefore, it is important to analyze claim terms in view of the
                           application’s specification from the perspective of those skilled in the relevant art
                           since a particular term used in one patent or application may not have the same meaning

                           <p id="ch2100_d1d52c_1b4d0_92"> Patented claims enjoy a presumption of
                              validity and are not given the broadest reasonable interpretation during court
                              proceedings involving infringement and validity, and can be interpreted based on a
                              fully developed prosecution record. Accordingly, when possible, courts construe
                              patented claims in favor of finding a valid interpretation. A court will not find a
                              patented claim indefinite unless it is “insolubly ambiguous.” See, e.g.,
                              <i>Exxon Research and Eng’g Co. v. United States,</i> 265 F.3d 1371,
                              1375, 60 USPQ2d 1272, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2001); see also <i>Metabolite Labs., Inc.
                                 v. Lab. Corp. of Am. Holdings,</i> 370 F.3d 1354, 1366, 71 USPQ2d 1081, 1089
                              (Fed. Cir. 2004) (“The requirement to ‘distinctly’ claim means that the claim must
                              have a meaning discernible to one of ordinary skill in the art when construed
                              according to correct principles….Only when a claim remains insolubly ambiguous
                              without a discernible meaning after all reasonable attempts at construction must a
                              court declare it indefinite.”). In other words, the validity of a claim will be
                              preserved if some meaning can be gleaned from the language. 
                           </p>
                           <p id="ch2100_d1d52c_1b4d0_a7">In contrast, no presumption of validity
                              attaches before the issuance of a patent. The Office is not required or even
                              permitted to interpret claims when examining patent applications in the same manner
                              as the courts, which, post-issuance, operate under the presumption of validity.
                              <i>In re Morris,</i> 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1028 (Fed.

                              The Office must construe claims in the broadest reasonable manner during prosecution
                              in an effort to establish a clear record of what applicant intends to claim. In
                              deciding whether a pending claim particularly points out and distinctly claims the
                              subject matter, a lower threshold of ambiguity is applied during prosecution.

                              courts.”). The lower threshold is applied because the patent record is in development
                              and not fixed. As such, applicant has the ability to provide explanation and/or amend
                              the claims to ensure that the meaning of the language is clear and definite prior to

                              arise after patent issuance, for example during infringement litigation, have no
                              place in prosecution of pending claims before the PTO, when any ambiguity or
                              excessive breadth may be corrected by merely changing the claim.”).

                              <i>Zletz,</i> 893 F.2d at 322, 13 USPQ2d at 1322. For example, if the

                              paragraph is appropriate. Examiners, however, are cautioned against confusing claim
                              breadth with claim indefiniteness. A broad claim is not indefinite merely because it
                              encompasses a wide scope of subject matter provided the scope is clearly defined.
                              Instead, a claim is indefinite when the boundaries of the protected subject matter
                              are not clearly delineated and the scope is unclear. For example, a genus claim that
                              covers multiple species is broad, but is not indefinite because of its breadth, which
                              is otherwise clear. But a genus claim that could be interpreted in such a way that it
                              is not clear which species are covered would be indefinite (e.g., because there is
                              more than one reasonable interpretation of what species are included in the claim).

                                 by the Supreme Court in <i>Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku
                                    Kogyo Kabushiki Co</i>., 535 U.S. 722, 122 S.Ct. 1831, 1838, 62 USPQ2d
                                 1705, 1710 (2002), a clear and complete prosecution file record is important in
                                 that “[p]rosecution history estoppel requires that the claims of a patent be
                                 interpreted in light of the proceedings in the PTO during the application
                                 process.” In <i>Festo,</i> the court held that “a
                                 narrowing amendment made to satisfy any requirement of the Patent Act may give
                                 rise to an estoppel.” With respect to amendments made to comply with the
                                 requirements of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, the court
                                 stated that “[i]f a <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">§ 112</a></b> amendment is truly
                                 cosmetic, then it would not narrow the patent’s scope or raise an estoppel. On the
                                 other hand, if a <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">§ 112</a></b> amendment is necessary
                                 and narrows the patent’s scope—even if only for the purpose of better
                                 description—estoppel may apply.” <i>Id.</i> at 1840,
                                 62 USPQ2d at 1712. The court further stated that “when the court is unable to
                                 determine the purpose underlying a narrowing amendment—and hence a rationale for
                                 limiting the estoppel to the surrender of particular equivalents—the court should
                                 presume that the patentee surrendered all subject matter between the broader and
                                 the narrower language…the patentee should bear the burden of showing that the
                                 amendment does not surrender the particular equivalent in question.” <i>Id.</i> at 1842, 62 USPQ2d at 1713. Thus, whenever
                                 possible, the examiner should make the record clear by providing explicit
                                 reasoning for making or withdrawing any rejection related to <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215">35 U.S.C.

                        <p id="d0e217763">The specification should ideally serve as a glossary to the
                           claim terms so that the examiner and the public can clearly ascertain the meaning of the
                           claim terms. Correspondence between the specification and claims is required by
                           <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320296">37 CFR
                                 1.75(d)(1)</a></b>, which provides that claim terms must find clear
                           support or antecedent basis in the specification so that the meaning of the terms may be
                           ascertainable by reference to the specification. To meet the definiteness requirement
                           under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215">35 U.S.C. 112(b)</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, second
                           paragraph, the exact claim terms are not required to be used in the specification as
                           long as the specification provides the needed guidance on the meaning of the terms
                           (e.g., by using clearly equivalent terms) so that the meaning of the terms is readily
                           discernable to a person of ordinary skill in the art. See, e.g., <i>Bancorp
                              Servs., L.L.C. v. Hartford Life Ins. Co.,</i> 359 F.3d 1367, 1373 (Fed. Cir.
                           2004). Nevertheless, glossaries of terms used in the claims are a helpful device for
                           ensuring adequate definition of terms used in claims. Express definitions of claim terms
                           can eliminate the need for any “time-consuming and difficult inquiry into
                           indefiniteness.” <i>Id.</i> Therefore, applicants are encouraged to use
                           glossaries as a best practice in patent application preparation. If the specification
                           does not provide the needed support or antecedent basis for the claim terms, the
                           specification should be objected to under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e320296">37 CFR 1.75(d)(1)</a></b>. See

                           For example, a claim with a limitation of “the clamp means including a clamp body and
                           first and second clamping members, the clamping members being supported by the clamp
                           body” was determined to be indefinite because the terms “first and second clamping
                           members” and “clamp body” were found to be vague in light of the specification which
                           showed no “clamp member” structure being “supported by the clamp body.” <i>In re

                           In <i>Cohn,</i> a claim was directed to a process of treating an aluminum
                           surface with an alkali silicate solution and included a further limitation that the
                           surface has an “opaque” appearance. <i>Id.</i> The specification, meanwhile,
                           associated the use of an alkali silicate with a glazed or porcelain-like finish, which
                           the specification distinguished from an opaque finish. <i>Cohn,</i> 438 F.2d
                           at 993. Noting that no claim may be read apart from and independent of the supporting
                           disclosure on which it is based, the court found that the claim was internally
                           inconsistent based on the description, definitions and examples set forth in the
                           specification relating to the appearance of the surface after treatment, and therefore

                           would be indefinite (e.g., because there is more than one reasonable interpretation of

                                 are used to define the invention whereby the metes and bounds of the claimed
                                 invention can be ascertained. During patent examination, the pending claims must
                                 be given the broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification.

                                 in the art for measuring the meaning of the term of degree). The claim is not

                                 measure a degree even without a precise numerical measurement (e.g., a figure that
                                 provides a standard for measuring the meaning of the term of degree). See, e.g.,

                                 as accurate as the subject matter permits, noting that the patent law does not

                                 specific amounts of nonsodium ingredients which add up to 100%, apparently to the

                           <p id="d0e218324">A claim is indefinite when it contains words or phrases
                              whose meaning is unclear. The lack of clarity could arise where a claim refers to
                              “said lever” or “the lever,” where the claim contains no earlier recitation or
                              limitation of a lever and where it would be unclear as to what element the limitation
                              was making reference. Similarly, if two different levers are recited earlier in the
                              claim, the recitation of “said lever” in the same or subsequent claim would be
                              unclear where it is uncertain which of the two levers was intended. A&nbsp;claim which
                              refers to “said aluminum lever,” but&nbsp;recites only “a lever” earlier in the claim, is
                              indefinite because it is uncertain as to the lever to which reference is made.
                              Obviously, however, the failure to provide explicit antecedent basis for terms does
                              not always render a claim indefinite. If the scope of a claim would be reasonably
                              ascertainable by those skilled in the art, then the claim is not indefinite. <i>Energizer Holdings Inc. v. Int’l Trade Comm’n,</i> 435 F.3d

                              the recitation of the components themselves. For example, the limitation “the outer
                              surface of said sphere” would not require an antecedent recitation that the sphere
                              has an outer surface. See <i>Bose Corp. v. JBL,

                              claims without using the means-plus-function format. See, e.g., <i>K-2 Corp. v.

                              filaments also “consisted of comparatively large crystals” but they were “subject to
                              offsetting” or shifting, and the court further found that the phrase “of such size

                              commercially useful life for a lamp or other device” did not adequately define the
                              structural characteristics of the grains (e.g., the size and contour) to distinguish
                              the claimed invention from the prior art.<i>Id.</i> at 370. Similarly, a
                              claim was held invalid because it recited “sustantially (sic) pure carbon black in

                              limitation: “commercially uniform” meant only the degree of uniformity buyers
                              desired; “comparatively small” did not add anything because no standard for
                              comparison was given; and “spongy” and “porous” are synonyms that the Court found
                              unhelpful in distinguishing the claimed invention from the prior art.

                                 ordinarily must belong to a recognized physical or chemical class or to an
                                 art-recognized class. However, when the Markush group occurs in a claim reciting a
                                 process or a combination (not a single compound), it is sufficient if the members
                                 of the group are disclosed in the specification to possess at least one property
                                 in common which is mainly responsible for their function in the claimed

                                 all of them possess this property. While in the past the test for Markush-type
                                 claims was applied as liberally as possible, present practice which holds that
                                 claims reciting Markush groups are not generic claims (<b><a href="s803.html#d0e98022">MPEP §

                                 propriety of the recited members. Where a Markush expression is applied only to a
                                 portion of a chemical compound, the propriety of the grouping is determined by a
                                 consideration of the compound as a whole, and does not depend on there being a
                                 community of properties in the members of the Markush expression.

                              negatively, the claim complies with the requirements of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215">35 U.S.C.

                              to define the invention in terms of what it was not, rather than pointing out the
                              invention. Thus, the court observed that the limitation “R is an alkenyl radical
                              other than 2-butenyl and 2,4-pentadienyl” was a negative limitation that rendered the
                              claim indefinite because it was an attempt to claim the invention by excluding what
                              the inventors did not invent rather than distinctly and particularly pointing out
                              what they did invent. <i>In re Schechter,</i> 205 F.2d

                              the boundaries of the patent protection sought were clear. <i>In re Barr,</i> 444 F.2d 588, 170 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1971).

                              in the specification, they may be explicitly excluded in the claims. See <i>In re Johnson,</i> 558 F.2d 1008, 1019, 194 USPQ 187, 196
                              (CCPA 1977) (“[the] specification, having described the whole, necessarily described

                              <p id="d0e218648">With the passage of the 1952 Patent Act, the courts
                                 and the Board have taken the view that a rejection based on the principle of old

                              <p id="d0e218654">A rejection on the basis of old combination was based
                                 on the principle applied in <i>Lincoln Engineering Co. v.
                                    Stewart-Warner Corp.,</i> 303 U.S. 545, 37 USPQ 1 (1938). The principle
                                 was that an inventor who made an improvement or contribution to but one element of
                                 a generally old combination, should not be able to obtain a patent on the entire
                                 combination including the new and improved element. A rejection required the
                                 citation of a single reference which broadly disclosed a combination of the
                                 claimed elements functionally cooperating in substantially the same manner to
                                 produce substantially the same results as that of the claimed combination. The
                                 case of <i>In re Hall,</i> 208 F.2d 370, 100 USPQ 46
                                 (CCPA 1953) illustrates an application of this principle.

                                 statutory language (particularly point out and distinctly claim) is the only
                                 proper basis for an old combination rejection, and in applying the rejection, that
                                 language determines what an applicant has a right and obligation to do. A majority
                                 opinion of the Board of Appeals held that Congress removed the underlying
                                 rationale of <i>Lincoln Engineering</i> in the 1952
                                 Patent Act, and thereby effectively legislated that decision out of existence.

                                 F.2d 840, 221 USPQ 657 (Fed. Cir. 1984), followed the <i><i>Bernhart</i></i> case, and ruled that a claim was not invalid under <i>Lincoln Engineering</i> because the claim complied with
                                 the requirements of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">35&nbsp;U.S.C. 112</a></b>, second

                              referred to a chemical compound as a “polypeptide of at least 24 amino acids having

                              Chemical compounds may be claimed by a name that adequately describes the material to

                              A compound of unknown structure may be claimed by a combination of physical and
                              chemical characteristics. See <i>Ex parte</i><i>Brian,</i> 118&nbsp;USPQ 242 (Bd. App. 1958). A compound
                              may also be claimed in terms of the process by which it is made without raising an
                              issue of indefiniteness.

                              name is used to identify a source of goods, and not the goods themselves. Thus a

                              scope is uncertain since the trademark or trade name cannot be used properly to
                              identify any particular material or product. In fact, the value of a trademark would
                              be lost to the extent that it became descriptive of a product, rather than used as an
                              identification of a source or origin of a product. Thus, the use of a trademark or
                              trade name in a claim to identify or describe a material or product would not only
                              render a claim indefinite, but would also constitute an improper use of the trademark

                              course of action would be for the examiner to enter two rejections: (A) a rejection
                              based on indefiniteness under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215">35 U.S.C. 112(b)</a></b> or
                              <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, second paragraph; and (B) a rejection
                              over the prior art based on the interpretation of the claims which renders the prior
                              art applicable. See, e.g., <i>Ex parte Ionescu,</i>
                              222&nbsp;USPQ 537 (Bd. App. 1984). When making a rejection over prior art in these
                              circumstances, it is important for the examiner to point out how the claim is being
                              interpreted. Second, where there is a great deal of confusion and uncertainty as to
                              the proper interpretation of the limitations of a claim, it would not be proper to
                              reject such a claim on the basis of prior art. As stated in <i>In re</i><i>Steele,</i> 305 F.2d 859, 134&nbsp;USPQ 292 (CCPA 1962), a
                              rejection under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302450">35&nbsp;U.S.C. 103</a></b> should not be based
                              on considerable speculation about the meaning of terms employed in a claim or
                              assumptions that must be made as to the scope of the claims. 
                           </p>
                           <p id="d0e219215">The first approach is recommended from an examination
                              standpoint because it avoids piecemeal examination in the event that the examiner’s
                              <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, second paragraph rejection is not affirmed, and
                              may give applicant a better appreciation for relevant prior art if the claims are
                              redrafted to avoid the <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae65_215">35 U.S.C. 112(b)</a></b> or
                              <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, second paragraph
                              rejection.
