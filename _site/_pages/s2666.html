                              errors in the examiner’s action and must reply to&nbsp;every ground of objection and
                              rejection in the prior Office action. The reply must present arguments pointing

                              language of the claims patentably distinguishes them from the references does
                              not comply with the requirements of this section.

                           first Office action on the merits has been issued. The first Office action on the merits
                           will ordinarily be mailed with the order. In some instances, however, it may not be

                           provide an amendment prior to the first Office action. Such an amendment would not be
                           considered, and it would be returned to the patent owner as an improper
                           paper.

                           change/amend the drawings, the patent owner should submit a sketch in permanent ink
                           showing the proposed change(s)/ amendment(s), for approval by the examiner. The
                           submitted sketch should be presented as a separate paper, which is clearly labeled as
                           “Annotated Sheet,” and it will be made part of the record. Once the proposed changes are
                           approved, sheets of substitute or new drawings must be submitted for each drawing sheet
                           that is to be changed/amended. If a new drawing sheet contains multiple figures, each
                           figure must be marked as “amended” or “new,” if applicable, to comply with the
                           requirements of 37 CFR 1.530(d)(3). For example, if the new drawing sheet contains
                           Figures 1-3 but only Figure 2 is amended, the new drawing sheet must identify Figure 2
                           as “Amended.” It is not sufficient to generally indicate that the entire sheet is
                           amended by, e.g., placing the term “Amended” in the header of the drawing sheet. The new
                           sheets of drawings should be entered in the reexamination file.

                              proposed rejection. The third party requester must present each newly proposed
                              rejection in compliance with the guidelines set forth in <b><a href="s2617.html#d0e251313">MPEP § 2617</a></b>, since
                              any such new proposed rejection stands on the same footing as a proposed rejection
                              presented with the request for reexamination, and is treated the same way as to
                              future Office actions and any appeal. See <b><a href="s2617.html#d0e251313">MPEP § 2617</a></b> as to
                              the required discussion of the pertinency of each reference to the patentability of
                              at least one claim presented for the newly submitted prior art. An explanation
                              pursuant to the requirements of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306631912">35 U.S.C. 311</a></b> of how the art is
                              applied is no less important at this stage of the prosecution, than it is when filing
                              the request. (It is to be understood that a rejection may be “proposed” by requester
                              if the examiner withdrew that rejection in a prior Office action, and this is the
                              first time requester has had an entry right to make it a “proposed” rejection;
                              however, such is not being discussed here, since, although it is “newly proposed,” it
                              is an old rejection to the case, based on art already of record).

                           submission of a fee clearly adds nothing on the merits. An example of this would be

                           terminal disclaimer on the third party requester. Where the patent owner then completes

                           comment. However, if the patent owner’s response is not limited to the bare submission
                           of the fee, i.e., if the response also includes argument, then the third party can
                           comment since the patent owner has addressed the merits of the case.

                           of the case. This would be the case, for example, where the failure to provide a
                           signature or a certificate of service is corrected, or where a permanent copy is
                           submitted to replace an “easily erasable” paper that was originally submitted.

                        <p id="d0e259669">In the case of correcting a
                           defective amendment, however, other issues come into play. Where for example, new claims
                           10-20 are improperly presented in a patent owner response (e.g., not properly
                           underlined), they generally will not be entered and form PTOL-2069 (Box 4) will be used
                           to notify the patent owner of the need to correct this defect. Until the defect is
                           corrected, claims 10-20 do not yet exist in the proceeding for the third party requester
                           to comment on. Likewise, any argument that was directed to such claims is not truly ripe
                           for the third party requester comment. After the patent owner corrects the defect,
                           claims 10-20 come into existence in the proceeding, and the argument presented by the
                           patent owner becomes relevant. At this point, the third party requester has a right to
                           provide comments in response to the patent owner’s argument, whether or not the argument
                           that was included in the original patent owner submission is re-presented with the paper
                           correcting the defect. Thus, any third party requester comments submitted either in
                           response to the patent owner’s initial paper (presenting the informal claims) or in
                           response to the patent owner’s supplemental paper (correcting the informality) will be
                           considered by the examiner.
