                        Regulatory Agency Determination of the Length of the Regulatory
                        Review Period [R-11.2013]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e277416">Under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303884">35 U.S.C.
                              156</a></b>, the regulatory agency is responsible for the determination of
                        the length of the regulatory review period for the approved product on which the
                        application for patent term extension is based. The determination by the regulatory agency
                        is made based on the application as well as the official regulatory agency records for the
                        approved product. See, e.g., 21 CFR Ch. 1, Subpart C. The determination of the length of
                        the regulatory review period is solely the responsibility of the regulatory agency.
                        <i>Aktiebolaget Astra v. Lehman,</i> 71 F.3d 1578, 1580-81,
                        37&nbsp;USPQ2d 1212, 1214-15 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (regarding U.S. Patent No. 4,215,113). To
                        determine the regulatory review period for an animal drug where the New Animal Drug
                        Application (NADA) components were submitted to FDA in a phased review, the approval phase,
                        as defined by <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e304273">35 U.S.C.
                              156(g)(4)(B)(ii)</a></b> , begins on the date of the submission of the
                        administrative NADA. See <i>Wyeth Holdings Corp. v. Sebelius,</i> 603 F.3d
                        1291, 1299-1300, 95 USPQ2d 1233,1240 (Fed. Cir. 2010).
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e277425">Once the determination has been made,
                        the regulatory agency publishes the information in the Federal Register and forwards a
                        letter to the Office with the same information. Included in both the Federal Register
                        Notice and the letter to the Office are the total length of the regulatory review period
                        and the relevant dates on which the determination is based. Both the letter to the Office
                        and the Federal Register Notice separate the total regulatory period into the initial or
                        testing phase and the final approval phase. This provides the Office with the information
                        necessary to determine the actual length of extension for which the patent may be eligible.
                        The Federal Register Notice also sets a date, 180 days after publication of the notice, as
                        a deadline for filing written comments concerning any of the information set forth in the
                        notice or a petition for a determination regarding whether the marketing applicant has
                        acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. The letter to the Office
                        makes clear that the determination does not take into account the issue date of the patent
                        nor does it exclude one-half of the testing phase.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e277428">The regulatory review period
                        determination is not final until due diligence petitions and informal hearings, if any,
                        have been resolved. A certificate for extension of the term of a patent may not issue from
                        the Office until the regulatory review period determination is final unless an interim
                        extension appears warranted under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303884">35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5)</a></b> and

                        </h1>
                        <p id="d0e277438">If a due diligence petition is filed
                           during the 180-day period following publication of the regulatory agency determination
                           of the regulatory review period, the regulatory agency (e.g., FDA) makes the
                           determination under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303884">35 U.S.C. 156(d)(2)(B)</a></b> whether the
                           applicant for patent term extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory
                           review proceedings. The term “due diligence” is defined in <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303884">35 U.S.C.
                                 156(d)(3)</a></b> as “that degree of attention, continuous directed
                           effort, and timeliness as may reasonably be expected from, and are ordinarily exercised
                           by, a person during a regulatory review period.” After affirming or revising the
                           determination of the regulatory review period, the regulatory agency notifies the Office
                           and publishes the results in the Federal Register. If no comment or petition is filed in
                           the time period provided, the regulatory agency notifies the Office that the period for
                           filing a due diligence petition pursuant to the notice has expired and that the
                           regulatory agency therefore considers its determination of the regulatory review period
                           for the product to be final. Following notification from the regulatory agency, the
                           Office will proceed with the final eligibility determination. See 21 CFR Ch. 1, Subparts
                           D and E.
