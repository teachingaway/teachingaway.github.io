                        final rejection that is not premature has been entered in a reexamination proceeding, the
                        patent owner no longer has any right to unrestricted further prosecution. Consideration of
                        amendments submitted after final rejection and prior to, or with, the appeal will be
                        governed by the strict standards of <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e322826">37 CFR 1.116</a></b>. Further, consideration of

                        <p id="d0e233321">The statutory period for response to
                           a final rejection in a reexamination proceeding will normally be two (2) months. If a
                           response to the final rejection is filed, the time period set in the final rejection
                           continues to run. The time period is automatically extended by 1&nbsp;month (in accordance
                           with the guidelines set forth in <b><a href="s2265.html#d0e230967">MPEP § 2265</a></b>) if the
                           response is the first response after the final rejection and a notice of appeal has not
                           yet been filed. Any advisory Office action using form PTOL-467, <i><i>Ex Parte</i></i> Reexamination Advisory Action
                           Before the Filing of an Appeal Brief, which is issued in reply to patent owner’s
                           response after final rejection (and prior to the filing of the notice of appeal) will
                           inform the patent owner of the automatic 1 month extension of time. It should be noted
                           that the filing of any timely first response to a final rejection (even an informal
                           response or even a response that is not signed) will automatically result in the
                           extension of the shortened statutory period for an additional month. Note further that
                           the patent owner is entitled to know the examiner’s ruling on a timely response filed
                           after final rejection before being required to file a notice of appeal. Notification of
                           the examiner’s ruling should reach the patent owner with sufficient time for the patent
                           owner to consider the ruling and act on it. Accordingly, the period for response to the
                           final rejection should be appropriately extended in the examiner’s advisory action. See
                           <i>Theodore Groz &amp; Sohne &amp; Ernst Bechert Nadelfabrik
                              KG v. Quigg</i>, 10&nbsp;USPQ2d 1787 (D.D.C. 1988). The period for response may not,
                           however, be extended to run past 6 months from the date of the final
                           rejection.

                           claims after a final rejection, or reinstate previously canceled claims. For an
                           amendment filed after final rejection and prior to the appeal brief, a showing under

                           whether the issues on appeal are reduced or simplified. Unless the proposed amendment is
                           entered in its entirety, the examiner will briefly explain the reasons for not entering
                           a proposed amendment. For example, if the claims as amended present a new issue
                           requiring further consideration or search, the new issue should be identified and a
                           brief explanation provided as to why a new search or consideration is necessary. The
                           patent owner should be notified if certain portions of the amendment would be entered if
                           a separate paper was filed containing only such amendment.
