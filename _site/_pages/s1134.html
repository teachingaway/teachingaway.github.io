                              be entered. In another example, assuming no notice of allowance has been issued in an
                              application, if a third-party submission is filed on the date that is six months
                              after the date the Office published the application and a first rejection has already
                              been mailed, the submission would not be timely and would not be entered (i.e., if
                              the Office published the application on May 21, a third-party submission filed on
                              November 21, which is the date that is six months after the date the Office published
                              the application, would not be timely as, according to the rule, the submission would
                              need to have been made on November 20 or earlier).

                                    For example, the following statements, presented alone, would not be considered
                                    anything more than bare statements of relevance that do not rise to the level

                                    in drawing the examiner’s attention to the relevant issues. For example, a
                                    description that includes an introductory paragraph describing the field of
                                    technology of a document and a claim chart that maps portions of the document
                                    to different claim elements would likely be considered “concise.” On the other
                                    hand, descriptions that merely repeat in narrative format the same information
                                    that is also depicted in a claim chart or that approach the length of the
                                    documents themselves will not likely be considered “concise.”

                                 examiner consideration. The examiner should consider the listed publications and
                                 accompanying concise descriptions in the third-party submission in the same manner
                                 as information in an information disclosure statement (IDS), generally before
                                 issuing the next Office action. Entry of a third-party submission does not

                                 sign form PTO/SB/429 (or equivalent) in the same manner as an IDS to indicate all
                                 the items and their concise descriptions have been considered. The examiner’s
                                 signature does not indicate the examiner agrees with the third party’s position
                                 regarding the publication, but only that the examiner considered the submission.
                                 Further, the examiner should clear the submission’s IDS flag in PALM and provide a
                                 signed copy of the PTO/SB/429 with the next Office action. There is no need for
                                 the examiner to comment on the submitted documents or the concise descriptions of
                                 relevance in the Office action. However, the examiner should apply the information
                                 as deemed necessary (<i>i.e.,</i> in a rejection of a claim). Also,
                                 the applicant need not respond to the third-party submission in the absence of a

                                 a listed document, the examiner should strike through the document to indicate
