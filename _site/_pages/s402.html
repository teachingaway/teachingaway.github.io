                                 combined declaration and power of attorney form on the USPTO Web site.

                              <p id="ch400_d1fe3e_29fb4_2c6">While a power of attorney may be signed
                                 by the inventor(s), the power of attorney should be signed by the assignee of the

                                 while the inventor is providing the power of attorney, thereby possibly raising an
                                 issue as to who is the practitioner’s client. Additionally, relationships between
                                 an assignee and the inventors may deteriorate. It is not uncommon in these
                                 situations for inventors to stop cooperating and in some cases file powers of
                                 attorney in an attempt to control prosecution of the application. A power of
                                 attorney by the assignee of the entire interest revokes all powers given by the
                                 applicant and prior assignees if the assignee establishes their right to take
