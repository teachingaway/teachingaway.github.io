                     <p id="d0e160900">See <b><a href="mpep-1400.html#d0e134581">MPEP Chapter

                     <p id="d0e160909">For design reissue application filing,

                     <p id="d0e160923">The term of a design patent may not be
                        extended by reissue. <i>Ex parte Lawrence</i>, 70 USPQ 326
                        (Comm’r Pat. 1946). If a reissue application is filed for the purpose of correcting the
                        drawing of a design patent, either by canceling views, amending views or adding new views,
                        the provisions of <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324692">37 CFR
                              1.173(b)(3)</a></b> must be followed. All changes to the patent drawing shall
                        be explained, in detail, beginning on a separate sheet accompanying the papers including
                        the amendment to the drawing. A marked-up copy of any amended drawing figure, including
                        annotations indicating the changes made, should be submitted. The marked-up copy must be
                        clearly labeled as “Annotated Marked-up Drawings” and it must be presented in the amendment
                        or remarks section that explains the change to the drawing.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e160932">A reissue application must be filed
                        with a copy of all drawing views of the design patent regardless of whether certain views
                        are being cancelled or amended in the reissue application. Inasmuch as the drawing is the
                        primary means for showing the design being claimed, it is important for purposes of
                        comparison that the reissue of the design patent shows a changed drawing view in both its
                        canceled and amended versions and/or show a previously printed drawing view that has been
                        canceled but not replaced. In addition to drawing views that are unchanged from the
                        original design patent, the drawing in the reissue application may include the following
                        views, all of which will be printed as part of the design reissue patent:
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e160935">(1) CANCELED drawing view. Such a
                        drawing view must be surrounded by brackets and must be labeled as “Canceled.” For example,
                        FIG. 3 (Canceled). If a drawing view is canceled but not replaced the corresponding figure
                        description in the reissue specification must also be cancelled. However, if a drawing view
                        is cancelled and replaced by an amended drawing view the corresponding figure description
                        in the reissue specification may or may not need to be amended.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e160938">(2) AMENDED drawing view. Such a
                        drawing view must be labeled as “Amended.” For example, FIG. 3 (Amended). When an amended
                        drawing view is present, there may or may not be a corresponding canceled drawing view. If
                        there is such a corresponding canceled drawing view, the amended and canceled drawing views
                        should have the same figure number. The specification of the reissue application need not
                        indicate that there is both a canceled version and an amended version of the drawing
                        view.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e160941">(3) NEW drawing view. Such a drawing
                        view must be labeled as “New” For example, FIG. 5 (New). The new drawing view should have a
                        new figure number, that is, a figure number that did not appear in the original design
                        patent. The specification of the reissue application must include a figure description of
                        the new drawing view.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e160944">If a drawing view includes both a
                        cancelled and amended version, and the change in the amended version is for the purpose of
                        converting certain solid lines to broken lines, the reissue specification must include a
                        statement indicating the purpose of the broken lines.
