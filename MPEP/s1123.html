                        nonpublication request has been rescinded before or on the date of the filing of a
                        counterpart application such that the application may be considered an application in which
                        no nonpublication request under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303117">35 U.S.C. 122(b)(2)(B)(i)</a></b> was made.
                        Since a notice of foreign filing is required by the statute and <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e325399">37 CFR 1.215(c)</a></b>,
                        the benefit of a certificate of mailing or transmission under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313726">37 CFR
                              1.8</a></b> will be given to a notice of foreign filing.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e120593">After either a rescission of a
                        nonpublication request or a notice of foreign filing is received by the Office, the Office
                        will enter the rescission or notice of foreign filing into the Office Pre-Examination
                        System to schedule the application for publication. A notice (e.g., a “Notice Regarding
                        Rescission Of Nonpublication Request and Notice of Foreign Filing”) should be sent to
                        inform the applicant of the projected publication date. The application will be published
                        promptly after the expiration of a period of 18 months from the earliest filing date for
                        which a benefit is sought under title 35, United States Code, or as soon as practicable
                        after mailing this notice. See <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303129">35 U.S.C.
                              122(b)(2)(B)(iv)</a></b>.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e120599">An applicant should not rescind a
                        nonpublication request or provide a notice of foreign filing unless a nonpublication
                        request was actually made, because filing a rescission when one is not needed leads to a
                        waste of Office resources and may delay prosecution in the application. Furthermore, filing
                        a rescission of a nonpublication request where a nonpublication request was not originally
                        made may result in a reduction to any patent term adjustment under <b><a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">35 U.S.C.
