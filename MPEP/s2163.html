                        Guidelines for the Examination of Patent Applications Under the 35
                        U.S.C. 112(a) or Pre-AIA 35&nbsp;U.S.C. 112, para. 1, “Written Description”
                        Requirement [R-11.2013]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e213590">The following Guidelines establish the policies and procedures
                        to be followed by Office personnel in the evaluation of any patent application for
                        compliance with the written description requirement of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>. These
                        Guidelines are based on the Office’s current understanding of the law and are believed to
                        be fully consistent with binding precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as the U.S.
                        Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and its predecessor courts. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e213596">The Guidelines do not constitute substantive rulemaking and
                        hence do not have the force and effect of law. They are designed to assist Office personnel
                        in analyzing claimed subject matter for compliance with substantive law. Rejections will be
                        based upon the substantive law, and it is these rejections which are appealable.
                        Consequently, any perceived failure by Office personnel to follow these Guidelines is
                        neither appealable nor petitionable.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e213599">These Guidelines are intended to form part of the normal
                        examination process. Thus, where Office personnel establish a <i>prima
                           facie</i> case of lack of written description for a claim, a thorough review of
                        the prior art and examination on the merits for compliance with the other statutory
                        requirements, including those of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302376">35&nbsp;U.S.C. 101</a></b>, <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383">102</a></b>,

                        completing an Office action which includes a rejection for lack of written description.

                           358 F.3d 916, 920-23, 69 USPQ2d 1886, 1890-93 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (discussing history and
                           purpose of the written description requirement); <i>In re
                              Curtis,</i> 354 F.3d 1347, 1357, 69 USPQ2d 1274, 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2004)
                           (“conclusive evidence of a claim’s enablement is not equally conclusive of that claim’s
                           satisfactory written description”). The written description requirement has several
                           policy objectives. “[T]he ‘essential goal’ of the description of the invention
                           requirement is to clearly convey the information that an applicant has invented the
                           subject matter which is claimed.” <i>In re Barker,</i> 559
                           F.2d 588, 592 n.4, 194 USPQ 470, 473 n.4 (CCPA 1977). Another objective is to put the
                           public in possession of what the applicant claims as the invention. See <i>Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly,</i> 119 F.3d 1559,
                           1566, 43 USPQ2d 1398, 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1997), <i>cert.
                              denied,</i> 523 U.S. 1089 (1998). 
                           "The
                           ‘written description’ requirement implements the principle that a patent must
                           describe the technology that is sought to be patented; the requirement serves both to
                           satisfy the inventor’s obligation to disclose the technologic knowledge upon which
                           the patent is based, and to demonstrate that the patentee was in possession of the
                           invention that is claimed."
                           
                           
                           <i>Capon v. Eshhar,</i> 418 F.3d 1349, 1357, 76 USPQ2d
                           1078, 1084 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Further, the written description requirement promotes the
                           progress of the useful arts by ensuring that patentees adequately describe their
                           inventions in their patent specifications in exchange for the right to exclude others
                           from practicing the invention for the duration of the patent’s term.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e213657">To satisfy the written description requirement, a patent
                           specification must describe the claimed invention in sufficient detail that one skilled
                           in the art can reasonably conclude that the inventor had possession of the claimed
                           invention. See, e.g., <i>Moba, B.V. v. Diamond Automation,
                              Inc.,</i> 325 F.3d 1306, 1319, 66 USPQ2d 1429, 1438 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <i>Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar,</i> 935 F.2d at 1563, 19 USPQ2d at
                           1116. However, a showing of possession alone does not cure the lack of a written
                           description. <i>Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Gen-Probe, Inc.,</i>
                           323 F.3d 956, 969-70, 63 USPQ2d 1609, 1617 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Much of the written
                           description case law addresses whether the specification as originally filed supports
                           claims not originally in the application. The issue raised in these cases is most often
                           phrased as whether the original application provides “adequate support” for the claims
                           at issue or whether the material added to the specification incorporates “new matter” in
                           violation of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303187">35 U.S.C. 132</a></b>. The “written
                           description” question similarly arises in the interference context, where the issue is
                           whether the specification of one party to the interference can support the newly added
                           claims corresponding to the count at issue, i.e., whether that party can “make the
                           claim” corresponding to the interference count. See, e.g., <i>Martin v. Mayer,</i> 823 F.2d 500, 503, 3 USPQ2d&nbsp;1333, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 1987).
                           In addition, early opinions suggest the Patent and Trademark Office was unwilling to
                           find written descriptive support when the only description was found in the claims;
                           however, this viewpoint was rejected. See <i>In re
                              Koller,</i> 613 F.2d 819, 204 USPQ 702 (CCPA 1980) (original claims constitute
                           their own description); accord <i>In re Gardner,</i> 475
                           F.2d 1389, 177 USPQ 396 (CCPA 1973); <i>accord In re
                              Wertheim,</i> 541 F.2d 257, 191 USPQ 90 (CCPA 1976). It is now well accepted
                           that a satisfactory description may be in the claims or any other portion of the
                           originally filed specification. These early opinions did not address the quality or
                           specificity of particularity that was required in the description, i.e., how much
                           description is enough. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e213684">An applicant shows possession of the claimed invention by
                           describing the claimed invention with all of its limitations using such descriptive
                           means as words, structures, figures, diagrams, and formulas that fully set forth the
                           claimed invention. <i>Lockwood v. Amer. Airlines, Inc.,</i>
                           107 F.3d 1565, 1572, 41&nbsp;USPQ2d 1961, 1966 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Possession may be shown in a
                           variety of ways including description of an actual reduction to practice, or by showing
                           that the invention was “ready for patenting” such as by the disclosure of drawings or
                           structural chemical formulas that show that the invention was complete, or by describing
                           distinguishing identifying characteristics sufficient to show that the applicant was in
                           possession of the claimed invention. See, e.g., <i>Pfaff v. Wells
                              Elecs., Inc.,</i> 525 U.S. 55, 68, 119 S.Ct. 304, 312, 48 USPQ2d 1641, 1647

                           characteristics sufficiently distinguish it”). 
                           "Compliance with the written description requirement is essentially a fact-based
                           inquiry that will ‘necessarily vary depending on the nature of the invention
                           claimed.’"

                           application specification may show actual reduction to practice by describing testing of
                           the claimed invention or, in the case of certain biological materials, by specifically
                           describing a deposit made in&nbsp;accordance with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e333189">37 CFR 1.801</a></b><i>et seq.</i> See <i>Enzo

                           Purposes, Final Rule, 54 Fed. Reg. 34,864 (August 22, 1989) (“The requirement for a
                           specific identification is consistent with the description requirement of the first
                           paragraph of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, and to provide an

                           before the patent is granted.” <i>Id.</i> at 34,876. “The description must
                           be sufficient to permit verification that the deposited biological material is in fact
                           that disclosed. Once the patent issues, the description must be sufficient to aid in the
                           resolution of questions of infringement.” <i>Id.</i> at 34,880.) Such a
                           deposit is not a substitute for a written description of the claimed invention. The
                           written description of the deposited material needs to be as complete as possible
                           because the examination for patentability proceeds solely on the basis of the written
                           description. See, e.g., <i>In re Lundak,</i> 773 F.2d 1216,
                           227 USPQ 90 (Fed. Cir. 1985). See also 54 Fed. Reg. at 34,880 (“As a general rule, the

                              discussed in subsection I., <i><i>supra</i>,</i> the issue of a lack of adequate written description
                              may arise even for an original claim when an aspect of the claimed invention has not
                              been described with sufficient particularity such that one skilled in the art would
                              recognize that the applicant had possession of the claimed invention. The claimed
                              invention as a whole may not be adequately described if the claims require an
                              essential or critical feature which is not adequately described in the specification
                              and which is not conventional in the art or known to one of ordinary skill in the
                              art. For example, consider the claim “A gene comprising SEQ ID NO:1.” A determination
                              of what the claim as a whole covers may result in a conclusion that specific
                              structures such as a promoter, a coding region, or other elements are included.
                              Although all genes encompassed by this claim share the characteristic of comprising
                              SEQ ID NO:1, there may be insufficient description of those specific structures
                              (e.g., promoters, enhancers, coding regions, and other regulatory elements) which are
                              also included.

                           <p id="d0e213785">The claimed invention as a whole may not be adequately
                              described where an invention is described solely in terms of a method of its making
                              coupled with its function and there is no described or art recognized correlation or
                              relationship between the structure of the invention and its function. A biomolecule
                              sequence described only by a functional characteristic, without any known or
                              disclosed correlation between that function and the structure of the sequence,
                              normally is not a sufficient identifying characteristic for written description
                              purposes, even when accompanied by a method of obtaining the claimed sequence. For
                              example, even though a genetic code table would correlate a known amino acid sequence
                              with a genus of coding nucleic acids, the same table cannot predict the native,

                                    isolated. One skilled in the art may be able to determine whether the gene

                                    comparing the restriction enzyme maps. In contrast, evidence that the gene
                                    could be digested with a nuclease would not normally represent a relevant

                                                   In contrast, without such a correlation, the capability to

                                       well established in our law that conception of a chemical compound requires
                                       that the inventor be able to define it so as to distinguish it from other
                                       materials, and to describe how to obtain it. Conception does not occur
                                       unless one has a mental picture of the structure of the chemical, or is able
                                       to define it by its method of preparation, its physical or chemical
                                       properties, or whatever characteristics sufficiently distinguish it. It is
                                       not sufficient to define it solely by its principal biological property,
                                       e.g., encoding human erythropoietin, because an alleged conception having no
                                       more specificity than that is simply a wish to know the identity of any
                                       material with that biological property. We hold that when an inventor is
                                       unable to envision the detailed constitution of a gene so as to distinguish
                                       it from other materials, as well as a method for obtaining it, conception
                                       has not been achieved until reduction to practice has occurred, i.e., until

                                       the alleged conception fails not merely because the field is unpredictable
                                       or because of the general uncertainty surrounding experimental sciences, but
                                       because the conception is incomplete due to factual uncertainty that
                                       undermines the specificity of the inventor’s idea of the invention. <i>Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Barr Lab. Inc.,</i>

                                       that the species which are adequately described are representative of the
                                       entire genus. Thus, when there is substantial variation within the genus,
                                       one must describe a sufficient variety of species to reflect the variation
                                       within the genus. The disclosure of only one species encompassed within a

                                       an inverse function of the skill and knowledge in the art. Satisfactory
                                       disclosure of a “representative number” depends on whether one of skill in
                                       the art would recognize that the applicant was in possession of the
                                       necessary common attributes or features possessed by the members of the
                                       genus in view of the species disclosed. For inventions in an unpredictable
                                       art, adequate written description of a genus which embraces widely variant
                                       species cannot be achieved by disclosing only one species within the genus.
                                       See, e.g., <i>Eli Lilly.</i> Description of a
                                       representative number of species does not require the description to be of
                                       such specificity that it would provide individual support for each species
                                       that the genus embraces. For example, in the molecular biology arts, if an
                                       applicant&nbsp;disclosed an amino acid sequence, it would be unnecessary to
                                       provide an explicit disclosure of nucleic acid sequences that encoded the
                                       amino acid sequence. Since the genetic code is widely known, a disclosure of
                                       an amino acid sequence would provide sufficient information such that one
                                       would accept that an applicant was in possession of the full genus of
                                       nucleic acids encoding a given amino acid sequence, but not necessarily any
                                       particular species. Cf. <i>In re Bell,</i> 991

                        <p id="d0e214557">The courts have described the essential question to be
                           addressed in a description requirement issue in a variety of ways. An objective standard
                           for determining compliance with the written description requirement is, “does the
                           description clearly allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that he or
                           she invented what is claimed.” <i>In re</i><i>Gosteli,</i> 872 F.2d 1008, 1012, 10 USPQ2d 1614, 1618
                           (Fed. Cir. 1989). Under <i>Vas-Cath, Inc.</i><i>v.</i><i> Mahurkar,</i> 935 F.2d 1555, 1563-64, 19 USPQ2d 1111,
                           1117 (Fed. Cir. 1991), to satisfy the written description requirement, an applicant must
                           convey with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date
                           sought, he or she was in possession of the invention, and that the invention, in that
                           context, is whatever is now claimed. The test for sufficiency of support in a parent
                           application is whether the disclosure of the application relied upon “reasonably conveys
                           to the artisan that the inventor had possession at that time of the later claimed
                           subject matter.” <i>Ralston Purina Co.</i><i>v.</i><i>Far-Mar-Co., Inc.,</i> 772 F.2d 1570, 1575, 227 USPQ
                           177, 179 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (quoting <i>In re</i><i>Kaslow,</i> 707 F.2d 1366, 1375, 217 USPQ 1089, 1096
                           (Fed. Cir. 1983)).

                        <p id="d0e214590">Whenever the issue arises, the fundamental factual inquiry
                           is whether the specification conveys with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art
                           that, as of the filing date sought, applicant was in possession of the invention as now
                           claimed. See, e.g., <i>Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar,</i> 935
                           F.2d 1555, 1563-64, 19 USPQ2d 1111, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 1991). An applicant shows possession
                           of the claimed invention by describing the claimed invention with all of its limitations
                           using such descriptive means as words, structures, figures, diagrams, and formulas that
                           fully set forth the claimed invention. <i>Lockwood v. Am.
                              Airlines, Inc.,</i> 107&nbsp;F.3d 1565, 1572, 41 USPQ2d 1961, 1966 (Fed. Cir. 1997).
                           Possession may be shown in a variety of ways including description of an actual
                           reduction to practice, or by showing that the invention was “ready for patenting” such
                           as by the disclosure of drawings or structural chemical formulas that show that the
                           invention was complete, or by describing distinguishing identifying characteristics
                           sufficient to show that the applicant was in possession of the claimed invention. See,

                           different circumstances where it must be determined whether the subject matter of a

                           description requirement. While a question as to whether a specification provides an
                           adequate written description may arise in the context of an original claim which is not
                           described sufficiently (see, e.g.,<i> Regents of the Univ. of

                           is a strong presumption that an adequate written description of the claimed invention is

                           rejection of an original claim for lack of written description should be rare. Most
                           typically, the issue will arise in the following circumstances:

                              <p id="d0e214915">The written description requirement for a claimed
                                 genus may be satisfied through sufficient description of a representative number
                                 of species. A “representative number of species” means that the species which are
                                 adequately described are representative of the entire genus. Thus, when there is
                                 substantial variation within the genus, one must describe a sufficient variety of
                                 species to reflect the variation within the genus. The disclosure of only one
                                 species encompassed within a genus adequately describes a claim directed to that
                                 genus only if the disclosure “indicates that the patentee has invented species
                                 sufficient to constitute the gen[us].” See <i>Enzo

                                 deemed to have invented species sufficient to constitute the genus by virtue of
                                 having disclosed a single species when … the evidence indicates ordinary artisans
                                 could not predict the operability in the invention of any species other than the
                                 one disclosed.” <i>In re Curtis,</i> 354 F.3d 1347,

                                 suitable for a PTFE dental floss.) On the other hand, there may be situations
                                 where one species adequately supports a genus. See, e.g., <i>In re Rasmussen,</i> 650 F.2d 1212, 1214, 211 USPQ 323,

                                 the disclosure of a species in the parent application did not suffice to provide

                              recombinant DNA molecules and used the term “leukocyte interferon.” Shortly after the
                              filing date, a scientific committee abolished the term in favor of “IFN-(a),” since
                              the latter term more specifically identified a particular polypeptide and since the
                              committee found that leukocytes also produced other types of interferon. The court
                              held that the subsequent amendment to the specification and claims substituting the
                              term “IFN-(a)” for “leukocyte interferon” merely renamed the invention and did not
                              constitute new matter. The claims were limited to cover only the interferon subtype
                              coded for by the inventor’s original deposits.
