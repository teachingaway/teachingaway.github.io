                                 routine PALM retrieval transactions are used to obtain data on reexamination
                                 files. From the USPTO Intranet site http://ptoweb/ptointranet/index.htm, Office
                                 staff can click on “PALM” and then “General Information” which opens the PALM
                                 INTRANET General Information Display. From here, enter the patent number in the
                                 box labeled Patent #. Then click on “Search” and when the “Patent Number
                                 Information” appears, click on “Continuity Data” to obtain the reexamination
                                 number.

                                 reexamination proceeding may be viewed on IFW. PALM provides information for
                                 the reexamination proceeding as to the patent owner and requester, contents,
                                 status, and related Office proceedings (applications, patents and reexamination
                                 proceedings). Some of the data entry for reexamination in PALM is different
                                 from that of a regular patent application. There are also differences in the
                                 status codes – all reexamination proceedings have status codes in the “400”
                                 range (there are some in the “800” range for some <i>inter partes</i> documents and actions), while patent applications
                                 have status codes ranging from “020” to over “100.”

                                    Available on IFW, i.e., Available Only in Paper File </i> — The
                                 movement of paper patent files related to requests for reexamination throughout
                                 the Office is monitored by the PALM system in the normal fashion. The patent
                                 file will be charged to the examiner assigned the reexamination file and will
                                 be kept in the examiner’s office until the proceeding is concluded. After the
                                 reexamination proceeding has been concluded, the patent file should be
                                 forwarded with the reexamination file to the Office of Patent Legal
                                 Administration for review (see MPEP § 2289) and then to the Office of Data
                                 Management. The Office of Data Management will forward the patent file to the
                                 Record Room after printing of the certificate.

                                 is used to monitor major events that take place in processing reexamination
                                 proceedings. During initial processing all major pre-<i>ex parte</i> examination events are reported. During the <i>ex parte</i> phase, the mailing of examiner’s actions
                                 are reported as well as owner’s responses thereto. The Central Reexamination
                                 Unit is responsible for reporting these events using the reexamination icon and
                                 window initiated in the PALM EXPO program. The events that will be reported are
                                 as follows:
