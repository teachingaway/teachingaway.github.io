                           patentee’s lack of knowledge of the need to pay the maintenance fee and the failure to
                           receive the Maintenance Fee Reminder do not constitute unavoidable delay. See <i>Patent No. 4,409,763</i>, <i>supra</i>. See also Final Rule entitled “Final Rules for Patent Maintenance
                           Fees,” published in the <i>Federal Register</i> at 49

                           the statutes and rules, the Office has no duty to notify patentees of the requirement to
                           pay maintenance fees or to notify patentees when the maintenance fees are due. It is
                           solely the responsibility of the patentee to assure that the maintenance fee is timely
                           paid to prevent expiration of the patent. The lack of knowledge of the requirement to
                           pay a maintenance fee and the failure to receive the Maintenance Fee Reminder will not
                           shift the burden of monitoring the time for paying a maintenance fee from the patentee
                           to the Office.

                           reasonable care on behalf of the patentee and/or the patentee’s agents, and reasonable
                           steps to ensure timely payment, the maintenance fee was unavoidably not paid, could be
                           submitted in support of an argument that the delay in payment was unavoidable. For
                           example, an error in a docketing system could possibly result in a finding that a delay
                           in payment was unavoidable if it were shown that reasonable care was exercised in
                           designing and operating the system and that the patentee took reasonable steps to ensure
                           that the patent was entered into the system to ensure timely payment of the maintenance
                           fees.
