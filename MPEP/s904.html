                     <p id="d0e115573">The examiner, after having obtained a
                        thorough understanding of the invention disclosed and claimed in the nonprovisional
                        application, then searches the prior art as disclosed in patents and other published
                        documents, i.e., nonpatent literature (NPL). Any document used in the rejection of a claim
                        is called a reference. An inventor name search should be made to identify other
                        applications and/or patents which may be applicable as references for double patenting
                        rejections. See MPEP § <b><a href="s804.html#d0e98894">804</a></b>.

                        parent applications should be reviewed by the examiner for pertinent prior art. Where the
                        cited prior art of a parent application has been reviewed, this fact should be made of
                        record in accordance with the procedure set forth at paragraph II.(E) of
                        <b><a href="s719.html#d0e94319">MPEP&nbsp;§&nbsp;719.05</a></b>. For national stage applications filed under 35

                        the examiner need not ordinarily make a second search of the prior art, unless necessitated
                        by amendments to the claims by the applicant in the first reply, except to check to
                        determine whether any reference which would appear to be substantially more pertinent than
                        the prior art cited in the first Office action has become available subsequent to the
                        initial prior art search. The first search should cover the invention as described and
                        claimed, including the inventive concepts toward which the claims appear to be directed. It
                        should not be extended merely to add immaterial variants.

                        the Office Action Correspondence Subsystem (OACS) to include the classes and subclasses of
                        domestic and foreign patents, abstract collections, and publications in which the search
                        for prior art was made. Other information collections and sources in which the search for
                        prior art was made must also be identified by the examiner. The examiner must also indicate
                        the date(s) on which the search was conducted. Note MPEP § <b><a href="s719.html#d0e94319">719.05</a></b>.

                        is brought up-to-date and/or where a further search is made, the examiner must indicate on
                        the IFW search notes form that the search has been updated and/or identify the additional
                        field of search. See MPEP §&nbsp;<b><a href="s719.html#d0e94319">719.05</a></b>. Any search updates should include

                           what they do require. During patent examination, the claims are given the broadest

                              found in a reference. The claim must be so analyzed and any such variant encountered
                              during the search should be recognized.

                              defined by the claim may be sketched or diagrammed in order to clearly delineate the
                              limitations of the claim. Two or more sketches, each of which is as divergent from
                              the particular disclosure as is permitted by claim recitation, will assist the
                              examiner in determining the claim’s actual breadth or scope. However, an applicant
                              will not be required to submit such sketches of claim structure. <i>In re Application filed November 16, 1945,</i> 89 USPQ 280,

                           application for patent, an examiner must conduct a thorough search of the prior art.
                           Planning a thorough search of the prior art requires three distinct steps by the
                           examiner: (A) identifying the field of search; (B) selecting the proper tool(s) to
                           perform the search; and (C) determining the appropriate search strategy for each search
                           tool selected. Each step is critical for a complete and thorough search. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e115705">When determining the field of
                           search, three reference sources must be considered - domestic patents (including patent
                           application publications), foreign patent documents, and nonpatent literature (NPL).
                           None of these sources can be eliminated from the search unless the examiner has and can
                           justify a reasonable certainty that no references, more pertinent than those already
                           identified, are likely to be found in the source(s) eliminated. The search should cover
                           the claimed subject matter and should also cover the disclosed features which might
                           reasonably be expected to be claimed. The field of search should be prioritized,
                           starting with the area(s) where the invention would most likely be found in the prior
                           art. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e115708">Having determined the field of
                           search, the examiner should then determine what search tools should be employed in
                           conducting the search. Examiners are provided access to a wide variety of both manual
                           and automated search tools. Choice of search tools is a key factor in ensuring that the
                           most relevant prior art is found during the search. The choice of search tools to be
                           used is based on the examiner’s knowledge of the coverage, strengths and weaknesses of
                           the available search tools that are appropriate for use in an examiner’s assigned art.
                           For example, a search tool may cover foreign patent documents; but, if that&nbsp;coverage
                           does not meet the examiner’s current search needs, this should be taken into
                           consideration by the examiner who will take recourse to employ other search tools in
                           order to remedy the deficiency. 
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e115711">Search tool knowledge is
                           particularly important for examiners in arts (e.g., very active, high technology) where
                           patent documents may seriously lag invention and, consequently, represent a reference
                           source of limited value. These examiners must take special care to ensure that their
                           searches include consideration of NPL and employ the effective use of tools specialized
                           to cover NPL pertinent to their search needs.

                        <p id="d0e115714">Search needs in some technologies,
                           e.g., chemical structures, DNA sequences, are very specialized and can only be met
                           through additional use of specific search tools specially constructed and maintained to
                           respond to those needs. These tools cover all three reference sources - domestic patents
                           (including patent application publications), foreign patent documents, and NPL
                           .

                           available NPL search tools and their use is often complex, examiners have been provided
                           and are encouraged to use the services of trained professional on-line search personnel
                           located in the Technology Centers (Information Technology Resource Person (ITRP)) and in
                           the Scientific and Technical Information Center (STIC) for NPL searching. See MPEP §
                           <b><a href="s901.html#d0e113237">901.06</a></b>(a) for services available in STIC.

                        <p id="d0e115729">In crowded, highly developed arts
                           where most claimed inventions are directed to improvements, patent documents, including
                           patent application publications, may serve as the primary reference source. Search tool
                           selection in such arts may focus heavily on those providing patent document
                           coverage.

                        <p id="d0e115732">Automated search tools covering
                           patent documents usually provide both a classified and text search capability. Text
                           search can be powerful, especially where the art includes well-established terminology
                           and the search need can be expressed with reasonable accuracy in textual terms. However,
                           it is rare that a text search alone will constitute a thorough search of patent
                           documents. Some combination of text search with other criteria, in particular

                           often, though not exclusively, in mechanical arts where, for example, spatial
                           relationships or shapes of mechanical components constitute important aspects of the
                           claimed invention. In such situations, text searching can still be useful by employing
                           broader text terms, with or without classification parameters. The traditional method of
                           browsing all patent documents in one or more classifications will continue to be an
                           important part of the search strategy when it is difficult to express search needs in
                           textual terms.

                           strategy should be determined by the examiner on a case-by-case basis along with
                           consultation with other examiners, supervisory patent examiners, and/or trained

                           should therefore be avoided. The examiner must fully consider all the prior art
