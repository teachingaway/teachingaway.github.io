                           however, cognizant of the need for the public to have correct information about
                           published patents and may therefore accept information about mistakes in patents from
                           third parties. <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e326574">37 CFR 1.322(a)(1)(iii)</a></b>. Where

                           of a Certificate of Correction. Accordingly, a fee for submission of the information by
                           a third party has not been imposed. The Office may, however, choose to issue a
                           Certificate of Correction on its own initiative based on the information supplied by a
                           third party, if it desires to do so. Regardless of whether the third party information
                           is acted upon, the information will not be made of record in the file that it relates

                        <p id="d0e144905">In an effort to reduce the overall
                           time required in processing and granting Certificate of Correction requests, the Office
                           will expedite processing and granting of patentee requests where such requests are
                           accompanied by evidence to show that the error is attributable solely to the Office
                           (i.e., requests filed pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e326574">37 CFR 1.322</a></b> only).
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e144911">The following requirements must be
                           met for consideration of expedited issuance of Certificates of
                           Correction:
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e144914">The text of the correction requested
                           should be submitted on a Certificate of Correction form, PTO/SB/44 (also referred to as
                           PTO-1050). Submission of this form in duplicate is not necessary. The location of the
                           error in the printed patent should be identified on form PTO/SB/44 by column and line
                           number or claim and line number. See also <b><a href="s1485.html#d0e146775">MPEP §
                                 1485</a></b>.

                        <p id="d0e144920">Where the correction requested was
                           incurred through the fault of the Office, and the matter is clearly disclosed in the
                           records of the Office, and is accompanied by documentation that unequivocally supports
                           the patentee’s assertion(s), a Certificate of Correction will be expeditiously issued.
                           Such supporting documentation can consist of relevant photocopied receipts, manuscript
                           pages, correspondence dated and received by the Office, photocopies of Examiners’
                           responses regarding entry of amendments, or any other validation that supports the
                           patentee’s request so that the request can be processed without the patent
                           file.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e144923">Where only part of a request can be
                           approved, the appropriate modifications will be made on the form PTO/SB/44 and the
                           patentee then notified by mail. Further consideration will be given to initially
                           rejected requests upon a request for reconsideration. In this instance, however, or in
                           the case where it is determined that the Office was not responsible for the error(s)
                           cited by the patentee, accelerated issuance of Certificates of Correction cannot be
                           anticipated (although the Office will make every effort to process the request
                           expeditiously).
