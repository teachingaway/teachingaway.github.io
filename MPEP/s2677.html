                              within such time as directed by the Director, furnish a written answer to the
                              owner’s and/or requester’s appellant brief or respondent brief including, as
                              may be necessary, such explanation of the invention claimed and of the
                              references relied upon, the grounds of rejection, and the reasons for
                              patentability, including grounds for not adopting any proposed rejection. A

                              primary examiner determines that the appeal does not comply with the provisions

                              made in an Office action reopening prosecution.

                        the examiner should make certain that all amendments approved for entry have in fact been
                        physically entered by the Central Reexamination Unit (CRU). The clerk of the Board will
                        return to the CRU any reexamination proceeding in which approved amendments have not been
                        entered.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e263897">The examiner should furnish each party

                        with a comprehensive examiner’s answer that provides a written statement in answer to each
                        appellant brief and each respondent brief. The examiner’s answer is to be completed by the
                        examiner <span class="Underline">within two weeks</span> after the appeal
                        conference. After the answer is completed (and signed), the examiner obtains the initials
                        of the appeal conference participants (the conferees) and then forwards the reexamination
                        file with the answer to the CRU Supervisory Patent Reexamination Specialist (SPRS) or
                        Technology Center (TC) Quality Assurance Specialist (QAS). The CRU SPRS/TC QAS reviews the
                        answer, and if the answer is in order, forwards the reexamination file with the answer to
                        the CRU support staff.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e263913">The examiner’s answer may incorporate
                        from any of the briefs the most accurate and most comprehensive information. It should
                        contain a response to the allegations or arguments made in all of the briefs and should
                        call attention to any errors in an appellant’s copy of the claims. If a ground of rejection
                        or reason for patentability is not addressed in the examiner’s answer, the proceeding will
                        be remanded by the Board to the examiner.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e263916">The examiner should report his/her
                        conclusions on any affidavits, declarations, or exhibits that were admitted to the record.
                        Any affidavits or declarations in the file swearing behind a patent should be clearly
                        identified by the examiner as being considered under&nbsp;either <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323512">37 CFR 1.131(a)</a></b>
                        or <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e359051">37

                        usually consider holdings on <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323512">37 CFR 1.131(a)</a></b> affidavits or
                        declarations but not holdings on <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e359051">37 CFR 41.154(a)</a></b> affidavits or
                        declarations in appeal cases.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e263946">It sometimes happens that an examiner
                        will state a position (e.g., reasoning) in the answer in a manner that represents a shift
                        from the position stated in the Right of Appeal Notice (RAN). In such a case, the answer
                        must indicate that the last stated position supersedes the former.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e263949">If there is a complete and thorough
                        development of the issues at the time of the RAN, it is possible to save time in preparing
                        the examiner’s answer. Examiners may incorporate in the answer their statement of the
                        grounds of rejection or determinations of patentability merely by reference to the RAN. The
                        page(s) and paragraph(s) of the RAN which it is desired to incorporate by reference should
                        be explicitly identified. If the examiner feels that further explanation is necessary,
                        he/she should include it in the answer. The examiner’s answer should also include rebuttal
                        of any and all arguments presented in all of the briefs.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e263955">All correspondence with the Board,
                        whether by the examiner or an appellant or respondent, must be on the record. No
                        unpublished decisions which are unavailable to the general public by reason of
                        <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054">35&nbsp;U.S.C. 122</a></b> can be cited by the examiner or the

                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e263961">The examiner should reevaluate his/her
                        position in the light of the arguments presented in the briefs, and should expressly
                        withdraw any rejections or determinations of patentability not adhered to. Such a
                        withdrawal would be a new finding of patentability (determination not to make a rejection)
                        or new ground of rejection, respectively. Pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e357652">37 CFR 41.69(b)</a></b>, an
                        examiner’s answer “may not include a new ground of rejection.” Pursuant to
                        <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e357652">37
                              CFR 41.69(c)</a></b>, an examiner’s answer “may not include a new
                        determination not to make a proposed rejection of a claim.” Accordingly, prosecution must
                        be reopened for any withdrawal of a rejection or of a determination of patentability.
                        Before issuing the action reopening prosecution, the examiner will consult with the
                        Reexamination Legal Advisor (RLA) to discuss at what point in the prosecution the
                        prosecution should be reopened, and then the examiner will prepare an appropriate Office
                        action. Note that the examiner may withdraw the Action Closing Prosecution (ACP) and reopen
                        prosecution at any time prior to the mailing of the examiner’s answer.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch2600_d1fddf_2a76a_331">Examiners should no longer hold any appeal
                        briefs defective including those appeal briefs that are already on the examiner’s dockets,
                        because they have already been reviewed by the Board and accepted. See
                        <b><a href="s2674.html#d0e262621">MPEP §
                              2674</a></b>. In a rare situation where an appeal brief contains serious
                        defects that will prevent the examiner from drafting an examiner’s answer, the examiner
                        should report the issue to the Director of CRU who will communicate with the Board
                        regarding the issue.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch2600_d1fddf_2a76e_1b9">In addition, examiners are not required to make
                        any determination whether fewer than all of the rejected claims are identified by the party
                        as being appealed. If the notice of appeal or appeal brief identifies fewer than all of the
                        rejected claims as being appealed, the issue will be addressed by the Board panel. The
                        examiner will treat all pending claims in the proceeding as being on
                        appeal.

                     <p id="ch2600_d1fddf_2a772_249">In a situation where at least two adverse
                        parties filed an appeal brief in the <i>inter partes</i> reexamination
                        proceeding (e.g., the patent owner filed an appellant’s brief and the third-party requester
                        filed a respondent’s brief), most of the time the issues have been completely developed by
                        the examiner in the RAN and by both parties in their briefs, and additional briefing from
                        the examiner is not necessary for the Board panel to decide the issues. Therefore,

                        proposed rejection set forth in the RAN, in a proceeding where at least two adverse parties
                        filed an appeal brief. With the approval of the CRU Director, examiners may provide
                        additional explanation as an attachment to the form PTOL-2291. For situations other than
                        where at least two adverse parties have filed an appeal brief, examiners are encouraged to
                        incorporate in the examiner’s answer their statements of the grounds of rejection and
                        determinations not to make a proposed rejection set forth in the RAN. Examiners are
