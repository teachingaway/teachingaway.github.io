                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e163262">The United States-Philippines search
                        exchange program involves patent applications filed in the United States which are
                        subsequently followed by corresponding applications filed in the Republic of the
                        Philippines and patent applications filed in the Philippines subsequently followed by
                        corresponding applications filed in the United States.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163265">The program operates as
                        follows:
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163268">The applicant files his or her
                        application in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) which will process the
                        application in the normal manner and examine the application in the usual time
                        sequence.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163271">If the applicant should later file a
                        corresponding application in the Philippines Patent Office, he or she may elect to use the
                        special filing procedure. Under this special filing procedure, applicant files his or her
                        application in the Philippines accompanied by a notice of election to participate in the
                        special procedure, which notice of election contains a certification that the description
                        (excluding references to related applications), claims, and drawings are identical to those
                        of the corresponding application originally filed in the United States. The earlier filed
                        application must be fully identified, and, in applications without a claim of priority, a
                        certified copy of the earlier filed U.S. application must be submitted to the Philippines
                        Patent Office. In addition, applicant must also agree that all amendments to his or her
                        U.S. application will also be made with respect to his or her application filed in the
                        Philippines.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163274">In the USPTO, applicant will regularly
                        file two copies of each amendment. One copy must be marked 
                        "Copy for Philippines Patent Office."
                        
                        
                         Upon
                        termination of prosecution, the USPTO shall remove all copies so marked from the U.S. file
                        and promptly forward the same to the Philippines Patent Office.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163280">Election forms for participation in
                        this special program must be signed in duplicate and simultaneously accompany the
                        application to be filed in the Philippines.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163283">Upon receipt of properly filed notice
                        of election, the Philippines Patent Office will notify the USPTO of the election by
                        forwarding one copy of the election forms to the USPTO. The Philippines Patent Office will
                        defer action on the Philippines application pending receipt of information as to the
                        disposition of the application by the USPTO. If no such information is received by the
                        Philippines Office within a reasonable amount of time from the date of filing in the
                        Philippines, the Philippines Office may, either on its own initiative, or at applicantâ€™s
                        request, inquire as to the status of the U.S. application and, if desired, proceed with its
                        own independent examination.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163286">Upon disposal of the application by the
                        USPTO, appropriate information will be sent to the Philippines Patent Office which will
                        include all necessary identifying data, whether allowed or abandoned, notice of allowance,
                        copies of documents cited during examination, a copy of the last office action and, when
                        necessary, any earlier actions which may be included by reference in the last action. The
                        Philippines Office will then make its own complete office action based upon the claims as
                        amended with USPTO, performing whatever checks desired and searching for copending
                        interfering applications. Alternatively, the Philippines may request applicant to show
                        cause why the results of the U.S. examination should not be accepted in the Philippines.
                        All avenues of appeal will remain open to the applicant.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163289">Where copending applications are cited
                        and applied during examination in the USPTO full examination will not be forwarded to the
                        Philippines Patent Office, and the fact that a U.S. copending application was cited would
                        be noted as a matter of information, since such references are inapplicable in the
                        Philippines.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163292">Where the application originates in the
                        Philippines Patent Office and is subsequently filed in the USPTO, a similar procedure as
                        outlined above, consonant with U.S. law, will be followed.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e163295">It is believed that this program will
                        facilitate the handling of U.S. origin applications filed in the Republic of the
                        Philippines resulting in a savings in time and expense of prosecution to U.S. applicants.
