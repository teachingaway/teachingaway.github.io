                           <i>Hoechst-Roussel,</i> 109 F.3d at 759 n.3 (“For purposes of patent term
                           extension, this active ingredient must be present in the drug product when
                           administered.”). In addition, a patent to a drug product having one form of an active
                           ingredient may qualify for an extension even though another form of the underlying
                           chemical moiety was previously approved and commercially marketed or used. For example,
                           a drug product having the ester form of a particular chemical moiety is a different drug
                           product from the same chemical moiety in a salt form, even though both the salt and the
                           ester are used to treat the same disease condition. See <i>PhotoCure v.
                              Kappos</i>, 603 F.3d 1372, 95 USPQ2d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 2010); see also

                           (Fed. Cir. 1990) (holding that a patent which claimed an ester of the acid cefuroxime
                           was eligible for extension regardless of previous approvals of two salts of cefuroxime).
                           Thus, eligibility for patent term extension for a patent which claims a product subject
                           to regulatory review as set forth in <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303936">35 U.S.C. 156(b)</a></b> turns on the
                           question of whether the product, i.e., the active ingredient of the drug product,
                           present in the final dosage form was previously approved by FDA. If neither it, nor any
                           salt or ester of that active ingredient has been previously approved by FDA, then the
                           patent should be eligible for patent term extension.
