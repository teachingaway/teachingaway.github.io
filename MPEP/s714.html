                           compliance is considered by the examiner as being “inadvertently omitted.” For example,
                           if an election of species has been required and applicant does not make an election
                           because he or she believes the requirement to be improper, the amendment on its face is
                           not a “<i>bona fide</i> attempt to advance the application

                           is without authority to postpone decision as to abandonment. Similarly, an amendment
                           that would cancel all of the claims in an application and does not present any new or
                           substitute claims is not a <i>bona fide</i> attempt to
                           advance the application to final action. The Office will not enter such an amendment.
                           See <i>Exxon Corp. v. Phillips Petroleum Co.</i>, 265 F.3d
                           1249, 60 USPQ2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001). If there is time remaining to reply to the

                           the remaining time period to avoid abandonment. Likewise, once an inadvertent omission

                           exists. Therefore, a second Office action giving another new (1 month) time period to
                           supply the omission would not be appropriate under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323620">37 CFR 1.135(c)</a></b>.

                           filed). An examiner also has the authority to enter the reply, withdraw the finality of
                           the last Office action, and issue a new Office action, which may be a non-final Office

                           <p id="d0e88298">In the event that a proposed
                              amendment does not place the case in better form for appeal, nor in condition for
                              allowance, applicant should be promptly informed of this fact, whenever possible,
                              within the statutory period. The refusal to enter the proposed amendment should not
                              be arbitrary. The proposed amendment should be given sufficient consideration to
                              determine whether the claims are in condition for allowance and/or whether the issues
                              on appeal are simplified. Ordinarily, the specific deficiencies of the amendment need
                              not be discussed. However, if the proposed amendment raises the issue of new matter,
                              the examiner should identify the subject matter that would constitute new matter. If
                              the proposed amendment presents new issues requiring further consideration and/or
                              search, the examiner should provide an explanation as to the reasons why the proposed
                              amendment raises new issues that would require further consideration and/or search.
                              The reasons for nonentry should be concisely expressed. For example:

                                    proposed, would not avoid any of the rejections set forth in the last Office
                                    action, and thus the amendment would not place the case in condition for
                                    allowance or in better condition for appeal.
                                 </li>

                              claims would be entered on the filing of an appeal if filed in a separate paper.
                              Whenever such an amendment is entered for appeal purposes, the examiner must indicate
                              on the advisory action which individual rejection(s) set forth in the action from
                              which the appeal was taken (e.g., the final rejection) would be used to reject the
                              new or amended claim(s).

                              certain portions of the amendment would be acceptable as placing some of the claims
                              in better form for appeal or complying with objections or requirements as to form, if
                              a separate paper were filed containing only such amendments. Similarly, if the
                              proposed amendment to some of the claims would render them allowable, applicant
                              should be so informed. This is helpful in assuring the filing of a brief consistent
                              with the claims as amended. A statement that the final rejection stands and that the
                              statutory period runs from the date of the final rejection is also in

                              application in condition for allowance or in better form for appeal. An examiner is
                              expected to turn in a response to an amendment after final rejection within an
                              average of 11 calendar days from the time the amendment is received by the examiner.
                              A reply to an amendment after final rejection should be mailed within 30 days of the
                              date the amendment is received by the Office. In <i>all

                              is placed in condition for allowance, applicant should be notified promptly of the
                              allowability of the claims by a Notice of Allowability form PTOL-37. If delays in
                              processing the Notice of Allowability are expected, e.g., because an extensive
                              examiner’s amendment must be entered, and the end of a statutory period for reply is
                              near, the examiner should notify applicant by way of an interview that the
                              application has been placed in condition for allowance, and an Examiner Initiated
                              Interview Summary PTOL-413B should be mailed. Prompt notice to applicant is important
                              because it may avoid an unnecessary appeal and act as a safeguard against a holding
                              of abandonment. Every effort should be made to mail the letter before the period for
                              reply expires.
