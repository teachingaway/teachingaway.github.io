                              include a lengthy discussion of why the claims are patentable over the items of
                              information, or why the items of information do not raise a

                              risk
                              of obscuring the “detailed explanation.” Such an obscured request could potentially
                              result in the Office finding the “detailed explanation” was not provided, and
                              therefore lead to a determination  that the request failed to
                              comply with the filing date requirements, and the loss of the date of the original
                              deposit of the request as the filing date.

                              For example, headings that identify each item of information and which claims are
                              being discussed are excellent tools to ensure clarity in the explanations. In

                              does not authorize the Office to accept a request for supplemental examination by a

                              a third party and thus circumvent the intent of the legislation for supplemental

                              the relevance of each item of information, and what the patent owner believes is the
                              manner of applying each item of information to each claim of the patent for which
                              supplemental examination is requested. The patent owner may not rely on a paper filed
                              by a third party (including a paper drafted by a patent examiner) to provide the
                              detailed explanation required by <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1d8bb_13e68_2ca">37 CFR 1.610(b)(5)</a></b> because the

                              accordance with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#ar_d1d8bb_13c8d_2c">37 CFR 1.610(a)</a></b> and

                              assist in the initial review of the request to determine if the filing date
                              requirements are met and in the examiner’s analysis of the request during the
                              supplemental examination proceeding.
