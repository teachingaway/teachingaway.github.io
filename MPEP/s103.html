            <p id="d0e1621">The Image File Wrapper (IFW) system
              uses image technology to replace the paper processing of patent applications in the
              Office. Paper components of these application files (including the specification, oath
              or declaration, drawings, information disclosure statements, amendments, Office actions,
              and file jacket notations) have been scanned to create electronic image files. For
              patent applications in the IFW system, the IFW file is the Official file and no access
              is granted to the original paper document sheets used to create the IFW file. All
              processing and examination is conducted using the electronic images instead of the paper
              source documents.
            </p>
            <p id="ch100_d1fe41_2503c_25c">If an IFW file has been created for a patented
              application, published application, or an application to which a patented or published
              application claims domestic priority, the IFW file (with the exception of non-patent
              literature) is accessible through public PAIR. All patent applications filed after June
              30, 2003, have been scanned into the IFW system and will be available in public PAIR as
              soon as they have been published or patented. Pending applications filed before June 30,
              2003, are scanned into IFW as incoming papers are received in the Office.

              reference in a U.S. patent application publication or a U.S. patent, upon the filing of
              an appropriate request and the payment of the required fee. However, if only part of the
              application is incorporated by reference, for example, where an application states, “the
              disclosure of a valve on page 5, lines 5-35, of application No. XX/YYY,YYY, is hereby
              incorporated by reference,” then a petition for access is required to obtain access to
              or a copy of the incorporated material. Incorporation by reference of part of an
              application in a U.S. patent application publication or a U.S. patent constitutes a

              access to that part of the original disclosure of the application be granted on
              petition. The incorporation by reference will be interpreted as a waiver of
              confidentiality of only that part of the original disclosure as filed, and not the
              entire application file. <i>In re Gallo,</i> 231 USPQ 496
              (Comm’r Pat. 1986). If applicant objects to access to the entire application file,
              applicant must file two copies of the information incorporated by reference along with
              the objection. In the example given, applicant would be required to provide two copies
              of page 5, lines 5-35 of the XX/YYY,YYY application. Failure to provide the material
              within the time period provided will result in the entire application content (including
              prosecution history) being made available to the petitioner. The Office will not attempt

              is entitled to access. The applicant will normally be given a limited period such as 3
              weeks within which to state any objection to the granting of the petition for access and
              reasons why it should by denied. If applicant states that he or she has no objection to
              the requested access, the petition will be granted. If objection is raised or applicant
              does not respond, the petition will be decided on the record. If access is granted to
              the application, any objections filed by the applicant will be available to the
              petitioner since these papers are in the application file. If access to the application
              is denied, petitioner will not receive copies of any objections filed by the applicant.
              A determination will be made whether “special circumstances” are present which warrant a
              grant of access under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303054">35 U.S.C. 122</a></b>. See below when the
              application is the basis of a claim for benefit of an earlier filing date under
              <b><a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#d0e303023">35
                 U.S.C. 120</a></b> or part of the application is incorporated by reference
              in a United States patent. “Special circumstances” could be found where an applicant has
              relied upon his or her application as a means to interfere with a competitor’s business
              or customers. See, e.g., <i>In re Crossman, </i>187 USPQ 367
              (PTO Solicitor 1975); and <i> In re Trimless Cabinets,</i>
              128 USPQ 95 (Comm’r Pat. 1960). Furthermore, “special circumstances” could be found
              where an attorney or agent of record in an application in which a provisional double
              patenting rejection is made does not have power of attorney in the copending application
              having a common assignee or inventor. However, a more expeditious means of obtaining
              access would be to obtain power to inspect from an assignee or inventor. See

                    months after being notified of the intention to make the action

                    states with specificity that such information is not otherwise

                    protect such information, the party must explain why. The party will

                    and seek court review before any contested portion of the action is

              These sections are applicable to decisions deemed by the Director to involve an
              interpretation of patent laws or regulation that would be of significant precedential
              value, where such decisions are contained in either pending or abandoned applications or
              in Board records not otherwise open to the public. It is applicable whether or not the

               <li id="d0e2455" class="nobull">(a) A request for USPTO
                 records that are not customarily made available to the public as part of
                 USPTO’s regular informational services must be in&nbsp;writing, and shall be
                 processed under FOIA, regardless of whether FOIA is mentioned in the
                 request. Requests should be sent to the USPTO FOIA Officer, United States
                 Patent and Trademark Office, P.O. Box&nbsp;1450, Alexandria, Virginia 22313-1450
                 (records FOIA requires to be made regularly available for public inspection
                 and copying are addressed in § <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e359977">102.2(c)</a></b>). For the
                 quickest handling, the request letter and envelope should be marked “Freedom
                 of Information Act Request.” For requests for records about oneself, §
                 <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e361069">102.24</a></b> contains
                 additional requirements. For requests for records about another individual,
                 either a written authorization signed by that individual permitting
                 disclosure of those records to the requester or proof that individual is
                 deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary)
                 facilitates processing the request.
               </li>
               <li id="d0e2465" class="nobull">(b) The records requested must
                 be described in enough detail to enable USPTO personnel to locate them with
                 a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, a request should include
                 specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or
                 name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record, and the name and
                 location of the office where the record is located. Also, if records about a
                 court case are sought, the title of the case, the court in which the case
                 was filed, and the nature of the case should be included. If known, any file
                 designations or descriptions for the requested records should be included.
                 In general, the more specifically the request describes the records sought,
                 the greater the likelihood that USPTO will locate those records. If the FOIA
                 Officer determines that a request does not reasonably describe records, the
                 FOIA Officer will inform the requester what additional information is needed
                 or why the request is otherwise insufficient. The FOIA Officer also may give
                 the requester an opportunity to discuss the request so that it may be
                 modified to meet the requirements of this section.
