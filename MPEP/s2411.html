                                 in the context that the application as filed does not contain a description to
                                 support an amendment to the specification or claims. An amendment to the claims
                                 that is not described in the application as filed would justify a rejection of

                                 inventor(s) to be better than any other, and (2) if a best mode was
                                 contemplated at that time, that the inventor(s) concealed the best mode
                                 (accidentally or intentionally) by failing to adequately describe that best
                                 mode. See <i>Chemcast Corp. v. Arco Industries
