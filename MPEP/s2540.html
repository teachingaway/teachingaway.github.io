                        filed during the enforceable life of the patent. Patentees should ensure that the Office is
                        properly notified of the proper “fee address” to which all maintenance fee communications
                        are to be directed. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e248849">Under the statutes and rules, the
                        Office has no duty to notify patentee of the requirement to pay maintenance fees or to
                        notify patentee when the maintenance fee is due. It is solely the responsibility of the
                        patentee to ensure that the maintenance fee is paid timely to prevent expiration of the
                        patent. The failure to receive&nbsp;the reminder notice will not shift the burden of monitoring
                        the time for paying a maintenance fee from the patentee to the Office. The Office will
                        attempt to assist patentees through the mailing of a Maintenance Fee Reminder in the grace
                        period. However, the failure to receive a Maintenance Fee Reminder will not relieve the
                        patentee of the obligation to timely pay the appropriate maintenance fee to prevent
                        expiration of the patent, nor will it constitute unavoidable delay if the patentee seeks to
                        reinstate the patent under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e327126">37&nbsp;CFR 1.378(b)</a></b>. See <i>In re Patent No. 4,409,763,</i> 7&nbsp;USPQ2d 1798 (Comm’r Pat. 1988),

                     <p id="d0e248873"> 37 CFR 1.363(c) states that “[a] fee

                        by a customer number can be established as the fee address for maintenance fee purposes.
                        The use of the following form(s) is suggested when requesting establishment of a fee
                        address: a current version of the 
                        "Fee

                        Office for the address being designated as the fee address, that customer number should be
