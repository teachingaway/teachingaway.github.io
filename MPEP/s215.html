                        </h2>
                        <p id="ch200_d1ff72_234aa_2c6">35 U.S.C. 119(b)(3) authorizes the Office to
                           require the applicant to furnish a certified copy of the foreign priority application,
                           and the Office requires such a copy pursuant to 37 CFR 1.55. The filing of the foreign
                           priority papers under 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d) makes the record of the file of the United
                           States patent complete. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office does not normally examine
                           the papers to determine whether the applicant is in fact entitled to the right of
                           priority and does not grant or refuse the right of priority, except when the application
                           is involved in an interference or derivation proceeding, when necessary to overcome the
                           date of a reference relied upon by the examiner, or when deemed necessary by the
                           examiner. See MPEP § 216. When the claim to priority and the certified copy of the
                           foreign application are received while the application is pending before the examiner,
                           the examiner should review the certified copy to see that it contains no obvious formal
                           defects and that it corresponds in number, date and country to the application
                           identified in the application data sheet for an application filed on or after September
                           16, 2012, or oath or declaration for an application filed prior to September 16, 2012.

                        <p id="ch200_d1ff72_2353e_20c">The certified copy which must be filed is a
                           copy of the original foreign application with a certification by the patent office of
                           the foreign country in which it was filed. Certified copies ordinarily consist of a copy
                           of the specification and drawings of the applications as filed with a certificate of the
                           foreign patent office giving certain information. Certified copies include those
                           retrieved by the Office in accordance with a priority document exchange program. See
                           MPEP § 215.01. “Application” in this connection is not considered to include formal
                           papers such as a petition. A copy of the foreign patent as issued does not comply since
                           the application as filed is required; however, a copy of the printed specification and
                           drawing of the foreign patent is sufficient if the certification indicates that it
                           corresponds to the application as filed.

                           will be no review of the papers and the patent when published will not include the
                           priority claim. A certificate of correction under 35 U.S.C. 255 and 37 CFR 1.323 can be
                           filed to have the foreign priority claim or certified copy considered after publication
                           of the patent. In addition, for original applications filed under 35 U.S.C.111(a)(other
                           than design applications), a grantable petition to accept an unintentionally delayed
                           claim for priority under 37 CFR 1.55 must be filed with the certificate of
                           correction.

                           agreements provide for the electronic transmission of priority documents to and from
                           participating foreign intellectual property offices. The Office treats a proper priority
                           claim under 37 CFR 1.55 to an application filed in a participating foreign intellectual
                           property office as a request that the Office obtain a copy of the foreign application
                           from the participating intellectual property office. A separate written request may be
                           used when the applicant wishes the Office to retrieve a foreign application from a
                           foreign intellectual property office that becomes a participating foreign intellectual
                           property office after the foreign priority has been claimed, so long as the time period
                           set in 37 CFR 1.55 has not expired. A separate written request is required in the
                           situation where the foreign application is not originally filed in a participating
                           office, but a certified copy of the foreign application was filed in an application
                           subsequently filed in a participating foreign intellectual property office. Applicants
                           can use Form PTO/SB/38 (Request to Retrieve Electronic Priority Application(s)) to file
                           such a request.

                           foreign priority claim that is incomplete will prevent successful electronic retrieval
                           of the priority application. Applicants are strongly encouraged to cite the foreign
                           application using an acceptable format (see MPEP § 214.04) and use proper and consistent
                           citation format throughout the U.S. application.

                           foreign application to which priority is claimed in a U.S. application will be made by
                           the USPTO at approximately 19 months from the filing date of that foreign application.
                           However, an electronic retrieval attempt by the USPTO will be initiated earlier than 19
                           months in the following situations: applications granted accelerated examination status;
                           applications in which a petition has been granted under the Patent Prosecution Highway
                           program; and, when an Office action by the examiner is mailed prior to 19 months from
                           the foreign priority date. In any case the USPTO will not attempt electronic retrieval
                           until the Office of Patent Application Processing has completed its review of the
                           application. Applicants are encouraged to check the Patent Application and Information
                           Retrieval (PAIR) to determine whether the foreign priority application has been
                           successfully retrieved. A successful request to retrieve an electronic foreign priority
                           application takes approximately 1 week to complete.

                           copy of the foreign application under the priority document exchange program because
                           successful retrieval of priority documents cannot be guaranteed. To be entitled to

                           <p id="ch200_d1ff72_24cd0_10d">Applicants continue to bear the ultimate
                              responsibility for ensuring that the priority document is filed during the pendency
                              of the application and before the patent is issued. Accordingly, applicants are
                              encouraged to check as necessary to confirm receipt by the Office of appropriate
                              documents. Priority documents retrieved from a participating foreign intellectual
                              property office will bear the document description: ‘‘Priority documents
                              electronically retrieved by USPTO from a participating IP Office.’’ Furthermore, 37
                              CFR 1.55(h)(4) provides that, under specified conditions, if the foreign application
                              was not filed in a participating foreign intellectual property office, the applicant
                              can file a request in a separate document that the Office obtain a copy of the
                              foreign application from a participating intellectual property office that permits
                              the Office to obtain such a copy. Applicants can use Form PTO/SB/38 (Request to
                              Retrieve Electronic Priority Application(s)) to file such a request. If the Office
                              receives a copy of the foreign application from the participating foreign
                              intellectual property office within the pendency of the application and before the
                              patent is granted, the applicant need not file a certified paper copy of the foreign
                              application. As a specific example, Germany is not currently a participating foreign
                              intellectual property office, however a DE application may be retrieved via the
                              priority document exchange program if it is identified in the claim for priority on
                              the application data sheet, a subsequent application filed in the European Patent
                              Office (EPO) or the Japan Patent Office (JPO) contains a certified copy of the DE
                              application, and the applicant timely files a separate request for the Office to
                              obtain from the EPO or JPO a copy of the certified copy of the DE application,
                              wherein the request identifies the DE application and the subsequent EP or JP
                              application by their application number, country, day, month, and year of their
                              filing.

                           <p id="ch200_d223b4_1b19c_c1">The Office treats a proper priority claim
                              under 37 CFR 1.55 to an application filed in a participating foreign intellectual
                              property office as a request that the Office obtain a copy of the foreign application
                              from the participating intellectual property office. A separate written request may
                              be used when the applicant wishes the Office to retrieve a foreign application from a
                              foreign intellectual property office that becomes a participating foreign
                              intellectual property office after the foreign priority has been claimed, so long as
                              the time period set in 37 CFR 1.55(f) has not expired. A separate written request is
                              required in the situation where the foreign application is not originally filed in a
                              participating office, but a certified copy of the foreign application was filed in an
                              application subsequently filed in a participating foreign intellectual property

                                 obtain a certified copy of the foreign application within the time limit set forth
                                 in 37 CFR 1.55(f) to use 37 CFR 1.55(i). The requirement for a certified copy of
                                 the foreign application to be filed within the time limit set forth in 37 CFR
                                 1.55(f) will be considered satisfied if the applicant files a copy of the original

                                 period specified in 37 CFR 1.55(i). 37 CFR 1.55(i) also provides that the interim
                                 copy of the foreign application must be filed together with a separate cover sheet
                                 identifying the foreign application by specifying the application number, country
                                 (or intellectual property authority), day, month, and year of its filing, and
                                 stating that the copy filed in the Office is a true copy of the original
                                 application as filed in the foreign country (or intellectual property authority).
                                 37 CFR 1.55(i) also provides that the interim copy of the foreign application and
                                 cover sheet must be filed within the later of sixteen months from the filing date

                                 CFR 1.55(i) finally provides that a certified copy of the foreign application
                                 ultimately must be filed within the period specified in 37 CFR 1.55(g)(1). Thus,
                                 providing an interim copy of a foreign application under 37 CFR 1.55(i) satisfies
                                 the requirement for a certified copy of the foreign application to be filed within
                                 the time limit set forth in 37 CFR 1.55(f), but a certified copy of the foreign

                           specified in 35 U.S.C. 119(b) or PCT Rule 17 before the patent is granted. If the claim

                           must, in any event, be filed before the patent is granted. If the claim for foreign

                           a design application), a grantable petition to accept an unintentionally delayed claim

                        <p id="ch200_d1ff72_27178_1ce">In view of the shortened periods for
                           prosecution leading to allowances, it is recommended that priority papers be filed as
                           early as possible. Although pre-March 16, 2013 37 CFR 1.55(a)(2) permits the filing of
                           priority papers up to and including the date for payment of the issue fee, it is
                           advisable that such papers be filed promptly after filing the application. Frequently,
                           priority papers are found to be deficient in material respects, such as for example, the
                           failure to include the correct certified copy, and applicants should ensure that there
                           is sufficient time to remedy any defects. For applications filed prior to September 16,
                           2012, where the priority claim is presented in the oath or declaration, a new oath or
                           declaration may be necessary where the original oath or declaration omits the reference
                           to the foreign filing date for which the benefit is claimed. The early filing of
                           priority papers would thus be advantageous to applicants in that it would afford time to
                           explain any inconsistencies that exist or to supply any additional documents that may be
                           necessary. It is important to note that for applications filed on or after September 16,
                           2012, the claim for foreign priority must be presented in an application data sheet (37
                           CFR 1.76(b)(6)).

                        <p id="ch200_d1ff72_27181_31e">It is suggested that a pencil notation of the
                           application number of the corresponding U.S. application be placed on the priority
                           papers. Such notation should be placed directly on the priority papers themselves even
                           where a cover letter is attached bearing the U.S. application data. Experience indicates
                           that cover letters and priority papers occasionally become separated, and without the
                           suggested pencil notations on the priority papers, correlating them with the
                           corresponding U.S. application becomes exceedingly difficult, frequently resulting in
                           severe problems for both the Office and applicant. Adherence to the foregoing suggestion
                           for making a pencil notation on the priority document of the U.S. application data will
                           result in a substantial lessening of the problem.
