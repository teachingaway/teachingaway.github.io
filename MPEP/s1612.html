                     <p id="ch1600_d1fe3f_197f0_2b8">The International Convention for the Protection
                        of New Varieties of Plants (generally known by its French acronym as "UPOV Convention") was
                        adopted on December 2, 1961, by a Diplomatic Conference held in Paris.
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch1600_d1fe3f_19805_17e">The UPOV Convention has been revised on November
                        10, 1972, on October 23, 1978, and on March 19, 1991, in order to reflect technological
                        developments in plant breeding and experience acquired with the application of the UPOV
                        Convention. As of December 5, 2012, 71 states and organizations were party to the UPOV
                        Convention.

                     <p id="ch1600_d1fe3f_1c474_175">Most states adhere to either the 1978 text or
                        the 1991 text. The United States adheres to the 1991 text, and has a reservation under
                        Article 35(2) of the text (which allows plant patents rather than breeder’s rights
                        certificates to be granted).
                     </p>
                     <p id="ch1600_d1fe3f_198a9_f5">The 1961, 1978, and 1991 texts guarantee to plant
                        breeders in each member state both national treatment and the right of priority in all
                        other member states. In many states, new plant varieties are protected by breeders’ rights
                        laws rather than patent laws. Accordingly, the Paris (Industrial Property) Convention
                        cannot always be relied on to provide these and other rights.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e162268">Insofar as the patenting of asexually
                        reproduced plants in the United States is concerned, both national treatment and the right
                        of priority have been accorded to foreign plant breeders since enactment of the plant
                        patent law in 1930 (now <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e304416">35 U.S.C. 161</a></b>-<b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e304454">164</a></b>). See <b><a href="s1613.html#d0e162350">MPEP § 1613</a></b> for the right of priority
                        based upon an application for plant breeder’s rights.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e162280">Application of the UPOV Convention in
                        the United States does not affect the examination of plant patent applications, except in
                        one instance. It is now necessary as a condition for receiving a plant patent to register a
                        variety denomination for that plant. Inclusion of the variety denomination in the patent
                        comprises its registration. The registration process in general terms consists of inclusion
                        of a proposed variety denomination in the plant patent application. The examiner must
                        evaluate the proposed denomination in light of UPOV Convention, Article 13. Basically, this
                        Article requires that the proposed variety denomination not be identical with or
                        confusingly similar to other names utilized in the United States or other UPOV member
                        countries for the same or a closely related species. In addition, the proposed denomination
                        must not mislead the average consumer as to the characteristics, value, or identity of the
                        patented plant. Ordinarily, the denomination proposed for registration in the United States
                        must be the same as the denomination registered in another member state of UPOV. 
                     </p>

                              1.76(b)(3)</a></b>, the Latin name and the variety denomination for the plant
                        claimed may be included in an application data sheet (ADS). The Office, pursuant to the
                        UPOV Convention, has been asked to compile a database of the plants patented and the
                        database must include the Latin name and the variety denomination of each patented plant.
                        Having this information in an ADS will make the process of compiling this database more
                        efficient.
