                        enacted on January 14, 2013. See Pub. L. No. 112-274, 126 Stat. 2456 (2013). Section 1(h)
                        of the AIA Technical Corrections Act revises the patent term adjustment provisions of
                        <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303525">35 U.S.C.
                              154(b)</a></b> and is effective for any patent granted on or after January
                        14, 2013. Section 1(h)(2) of the AIA Technical Corrections Act amended <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303684">35 U.S.C.
                              154(b)(3)(B)(i)</a></b> to change “shall transmit a notice of that [patent
                        term adjustment] determination with the written notice of allowance of the application
                        under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303440">section

                        determination no later than the date of issuance of the patent.” See 126 Stat. at 2457.
                        This change eliminates the need for the Office to provide an initial patent term adjustment
                        determination with the notice of allowance and before the patent term adjustment under
                        <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303590">35 U.S.C.

                           Term,</i> 65 Fed. Reg. 56365, 56374 (September 18, 2000) (explaining that a
                        two-part process is required because the Office is obliged under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303672">35 U.S.C. 154(b)(3)</a></b>
                        to provide a patent term adjustment determination before the issue date, and thus the
                        patent term adjustment, is known). <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#eff_20130401_d0e331832">37 CFR 1.705(a)</a></b> has been amended to
                        reflect that the Office will provide notification of the patent term adjustment on the
                        patent. The Office will no longer provide a notification of the patent term adjustment with
                        the mailing of the notice of allowance for any patent granted on or after January 14,
                        2013.

                     <p id="d0e275257"> The Office has revised

                              154(b)(3)(B)(i)</a></b>. The amendment to the statute provides that the
                        Office shall transmit a determination of the patent term adjustment no later than the date
                        of issuance of the patent. Accordingly, the Office is no longer required to transmit a
                        determination at the time of the mailing of the notice of allowance which occurs before all
                        of the guarantees of the statute could be calculated. The Office, however, will continue to
                        provide a preliminary patent term adjustment calculation with the issue notification that
                        is mailed to applicant prior to issuance of the patent, but the patent term adjustment
                        indicated on the patent is the “official” notification of the Office’s patent term
                        adjustment determination under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e303525">35 U.S.C. 154(b)</a></b>. Accordingly, patentee
                        should wait until the grant of the patent to determine whether or not a request for
                        reconsideration of the patent term adjustment indicated on the patent is warranted. See

                        Information Retrieval (PAIR) at http://pair.uspto.gov. Applicants may routinely use PAIR to
                        check the accuracy of the data entered in the PALM system for their applications (i.e., the
                        type of the paper and date of receipt in the Office) throughout prosecution. If any errors
                        are detected, they should be brought to the Office’s attention (e.g., by contacting the
                        examiner or the Technology Center’s customer service representative) as soon as possible to
                        ensure that they are corrected before allowance of the application and the determination of
                        the patent term adjustment. In checking Office records, applicants should keep in mind that
                        the date that should be recorded in the Office computer records is the date of receipt of
                        the paper, not the date that it was mailed under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e313726">37 CFR 1.8</a></b>. In
                        addition, if an original paper is misplaced by the Office and a duplicate is filed with a
                        post card receipt showing the date of receipt of the original paper, the date shown on the
                        post-card receipt for the original paper is the date that should be shown in the Office
                        computer records. If Express Mail service was used, then the date shown as the “date in” on
                        the Express Mail label will be entered into the Office computer records. Otherwise, the
                        date reflected in the Office computer records for a duplicate copy of correspondence will
                        normally be the date that the duplicate was received in the Office.
