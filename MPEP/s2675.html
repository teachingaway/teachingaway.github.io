                                          the record relied on. Any arguments or authorities not included in
                                          the brief permitted under this section or §§ <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e357524">41.68</a></b> and <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e357691">41.71</a></b> will be refused consideration by the
                                          Board, unless good cause is shown. Each issue must be treated under
                                          a separate heading. If the appellant is the patent owner, for each
                                          ground of rejection in the Right of Appeal Notice which appellant
                                          contests and which applies to two or more claims, the claims may be
                                          argued separately or as a group. When multiple claims subject to
                                          the same ground of rejection are argued as a group by appellant,
                                          the Board may select a single claim from the group of claims that
                                          are argued together to decide the appeal with respect to the group
                                          of claims as to the ground of rejection on the basis of the
                                          selected claim alone. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
                                          paragraph, the failure of appellant to separately argue claims
                                          which appellant has grouped together shall constitute a waiver of
                                          any argument that the Board must consider the patentability of any
                                          grouped claim separately. Any claim argued separately should be
                                          placed under a subheading identifying the claim by number. Claims
                                          argued as a group should be placed under a subheading identifying
                                          the claims by number. A statement which merely points out what a
                                          claim recites will not be considered an argument for separate
                                          patentability of the claim.
