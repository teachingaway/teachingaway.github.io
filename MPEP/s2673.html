                           <p id="d0e262550">Once an ACP has been issued,
                              there is no requirement for the patent owner to respond; where the patent owner does
                              not respond to the rejection of the patent claims, a RAN will still be issued and the
                              patent owner can appeal at that point to the Board. Because there is no requirement
                              for the patent owner to respond, there is no situation in which a Notice of Intent to
                              Issue <i>Inter Partes</i> Reexamination Certificate
                              (NIRC) can be issued after an ACP and prior to the RAN. Even if (after an ACP has
                              been issued) the examiner finds the patent owner’s subsequent argument to be
                              persuasive as to all of the claims, a NIRC would still not be issued, but rather, a
                              RAN would be issued to provide the third party requester with an opportunity to
                              appeal the “allowed” claims to the Board.
