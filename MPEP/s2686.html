                     <p id="d0e268114">It is important for the Office to be
                        aware of any prior or concurrent proceedings in which a patent undergoing <i>inter partes</i> reexamination is or was involved, such as
                        interferences, reissues, reexaminations or litigations, and any results of such
                        proceedings. In accordance with <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e335811">37 CFR 1.985</a></b>, the patent owner is
                        required to provide the Office with information regarding the existence of any such
                        proceedings, and the results thereof, if known. Ordinarily, while an <i>inter partes</i> reexamination proceeding is pending, third party
                        submissions filed after the date of the order are not entered into the reexamination file
                        or the patent file, unless the third party is a third party reexamination requester.
                        However, in order to ensure a complete file, with updated status information regarding
                        prior or concurrent proceedings regarding the patent under reexamination, the Office will,
                        at any time, accept from any parties, for entry into the reexamination file, copies of
                        notices of suits and other proceedings involving the patent and copies of decisions or
                        papers filed in the court from litigations or other proceedings involving the patent. Such
                        decisions include final court decisions (even if the decision is still appealable),
                        decisions to vacate, decisions to remand, and decisions as to the merits of the patent
                        claims. Non-merit decisions on motions such as for a new venue, a new trial/discovery date,
                        or sanctions will not be entered into the patent file, and will be expunged from the patent
                        file by closing the appropriate paper if they were entered before discovery of their
                        nature. Further, papers filed in the court from litigations or other proceedings involving
                        the patent will not be entered into the record (and will be expunged if already entered) if
                        they provide a party’s arguments, such as a memorandum in support of summary judgment. If
                        the argument has an entry right in the reexamination proceeding, it must be submitted via
                        the vehicle (provision(s) of the rules) that provides for that entry right. It is not
                        required nor is it permitted that parties submit copies of copending reexamination
                        proceedings and applications (which copies can be mistaken for a new request/filing);
                        rather, submitters may provide a notice identifying the application/proceeding number and
                        its status. Any submission that is not permitted entry will be returned, expunged, or
                        discarded, at the sole discretion of the Office.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e268129">It is to be noted that if the Office,
                        in its sole discretion, deems the volume of the papers filed from litigations or other
                        proceedings to be too extensive/lengthy, the Office may return, expunge or discard, at its
                        sole discretion, all or part of the submission. In such an instance, a party may limit the
                        submission in accordance with what is deemed relevant, and resubmit the papers. Persons
                        making such submissions must limit the submissions to the notification, and must not
                        include further arguments or information. Where a submission is not limited to bare notice
                        of the prior or&nbsp;concurrent proceedings (in which a patent undergoing reexamination is or
                        was involved), the submission&nbsp;will be returned, expunged or discarded by the Office. It is
                        to be&nbsp;understood that highlighting of certain text by underlining, fluorescent marker,
                        etc., goes beyond bare notice of the&nbsp;prior or concurrent proceedings. Any proper submission
                        pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e335811">37 CFR 1.985</a></b> will be promptly entered
                        into the record of the reexamination file, and will be considered by the examiner as to its
                        content, when the proceeding comes up for action on the merits. Thus, for example, if the
                        patent owner properly files in a reexamination proceeding, pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e335811">37 CFR 1.985</a></b>,
                        an enterable paper from the discovery stage of litigation of the patent being reexamined,
                        the paper would be entered into the reexamination file and considered by the examiner, the
                        next time the proceeding comes up for action on the merits. See <b><a href="s2686.html#d0e269513">MPEP

                              For example, a suspension of a first reexamination proceeding may be issued to allow

                              statutory provision is grounded on the need for certainty and finality as to the
                              question of patentability raised by the request for reexamination. Thus, if a second
                              request for reexamination will unduly delay the first reexamination proceeding, the
                              two proceedings generally will not be merged. If the Office were to merge the two
                              proceedings, the first reexamination proceeding would need to be withdrawn from its
                              place in the process, thus delaying, instead of advancing, prosecution. This would
                              run contrary to the statutory “special dispatch” requirement of <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306710">35 U.S.C.
                                    314</a></b> and its intent. On the other hand, if the Office does not
                              merge, the first reexamination proceeding can be concluded, and any question of
                              patentability raised by the second reexamination request can be resolved in the
                              second proceeding, with no delay resulting. The second request is then considered
                              based on the claims in the patent as indicated in the issued reexamination
                              certificate, rather than the original claims of the patent. However, the Office
                              always retains the authority to merge because in some instances, it may be more
                              efficient to merge the two proceedings, which would foster “special dispatch.” The
                              instances where the Office may, or may not, merge an ongoing reexamination proceeding
                              with a subsequent reexamination proceeding, are addressed on a case-by-case

                           Inter. 1991), where it was pointed out that neither the reexamination nor the
                           interference will ordinarily be stayed where both proceedings are before the Office.) It
                           is to be noted that 37 CFR 41.103 provides the Board with the flexibility to tailor a
                           specific solution to occurrences where reexamination and interference proceedings for
                           the same patent are copending, as such occurrences may arise. Decisions in the
                           interference will take into consideration the status of the reexamination proceeding and
                           what is occurring therein. The decision as to what actions are taken in the interference
                           will, in general, be taken in accordance with normal interference
                           practice.

                                 partes</i> reexamination and a reissue application, there will be <span class="Underline">no<i> inter partes</i><span class="Underline"> interview</span></span> as to the substance of the proceeding. Also, there will be <span class="Underline">no separate <i>ex parte</i>
                                 interview</span> as to the substance of the proceeding with either the patent
                              owner (the reissue applicant) or the third party requester (of the reexamination).
                              Accordingly, where a party requests any information as to the merits of the merged
                              proceeding, the examiner will <span class="Underline">not</span> conduct a
                              personal or telephone interview with that party to provide the information. Further,
                              an informal amendment by the patent owner (the reissue applicant) will not be
                              accepted, because that would be tantamount to an <i>ex
                                 parte</i> interview. All communications between the Office and the patent
                              owner (and the third party requester) which are directed to the merits of the merged
                              proceeding must be in writing and filed with the Office for entry into the record of
                              the proceeding.

                              the proceeding will be expedited to the extent possible. Cases will be taken up for

                              may be extended only upon a strong showing of sufficient cause (see

                                       question as to whether the art raises a question of patentability as to a
                                       patent claim is under consideration, the existence of a final court decision
                                       of claim validity in view of the same or different art does not necessarily
                                       preclude the presence of such a question. This is true because of the
                                       different standards of proof and claim interpretation employed by the
                                       District Courts and the Office. See for example <i>In

                                       is not the manner of claim interpretation that is applicable during

                                       deference to factual findings made by the court, the determination of

                           <p id="d0e269831">In <i>Trans Texas</i>, the patent being reexamined was subject to an infringement
                              suit, in which the district court had issued its claim construction ruling (in a
                              district court opinion) as to the definition of a term. The parties ultimately
                              reached a settlement before trial, and the district court issued an “Order of
                              Dismissal with Prejudice.” The patent owner relied on that district court claim
                              construction ruling in a reexamination proceeding, and argued that the Office was
                              bound by that district court claim construction ruling, under the doctrine of issue
                              preclusion. The Federal Circuit stated that issue preclusion could <span class="Underline">not</span> be applied against the Office based on a district
                              court holding in an infringement proceeding, since <span class="Underline">the

                              with a reexamination proceeding. The district court upheld the validity of the patent
                              in the infringement suit, while the reexamination examiner found the claim
                              combination to be obvious. The examiner’s rejection was affirmed by the Board. The
                              defendant (the alleged infringer) of the infringement suit appealed the district
                              court decision to the Federal Circuit, while the patent owner appealed the Board’s
                              decision to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit consolidated the appeals, and
                              then addressed only the patent owner’s reexamination appeal from the Board. The
                              Federal Circuit affirmed the examiner’s conclusion of obviousness by relying upon and

                              substantial new question of patentability existed as to the same claims based on the
                              <i>same prior art reference applied in the same manner</i> in the

                              1988) that the Office is not bound by a court’s decision upholding validity and
                              should continue the reexamination. The Court noted that District Courts and the
                              Office use different standards of proof in determining invalidity and
                              unpatentability, and thus, on the same evidence, could quite correctly come to
                              different conclusions. Specifically, invalidity in a District Court must be shown by
                              “clear and convincing” evidence, whereas in the Office it is sufficient to show
                              non-patentability by a “preponderance” of the evidence. Since the “clear and
                              convincing” standard is harder to satisfy than the “preponderance standard,” a
                              court’s decision upholding validity is not controlling. Deference will, however,
                              ordinarily be accorded to the factual findings of the court, where the evidence
                              before the Office and the court is the same. If sufficient reasons are present,
                              claims upheld by the court may be rejected in reexamination.

                              in 2002, borrowed heavily from the existing <i>ex

                              two regimes is that Congress specifically provided estoppel provisions to shut down
                              an <i>inter partes</i> reexamination of a patent claim
                              when a “final decision” upholding the validity of that claim has been reached in a
                              civil action or in a prior <i>inter partes</i>

                              history of the estoppel provisions make it clear that the <i>inter partes</i> reexamination of a claim (requested by a party) must be
                              terminated once a final decision upholding the validity of that claim (challenged by
                              the same party) has issued “after any appeals,” not simply just after a district
                              court decision which is still pending on appeal. While Congress desired that the
                              creation of an <i>inter partes</i> reexamination option
                              would lead to a reduction in expensive patent litigation, it nonetheless also
                              provided <span class="Underline">in the statute</span> that a court validity

                              patent may occur simultaneously; but once one proceeding <span class="Underline">finally ends</span> in a manner adverse to a third party, then the issues
                              raised (or that could have been raised) with respect to the validity of a claim in
                              that proceeding would have estoppel effect on the same issues in the other
                              proceeding.

                                       favor in the litigation. Had requester filed its requests for reexamination
                                       earlier, the reexamination proceedings would have been much farther along in
                                       the process, and may likely have been completed at the Office <span class="Underline">before</span> the District Court issued its
                                       decision. Moreover, had requester filed its reexamination requests earlier
                                       in the litigation, the District Court might have stayed the litigation to
                                       await the Office’s decisions in the two reexamination proceedings. After
                                       choosing to go years through the entire District Court litigation proceeding
                                       without asking for the Office’s input, requester was not in a position to
                                       complain that a suspension of the ‘093 and ‘094 reexamination proceedings
                                       would deprive requester of a chance to obtain the Office’s decision, when
                                       there was a strong possibility that the Federal Circuit’s decision would
                                       estop the Office from issuing any decision at all. In short, requester could
                                       not have it both ways. Requester waited three years after the district court
                                       case began, and waited until after the District Court issued a final
                                       decision, such that its District Court litigation could in no way be
                                       affected by any decision on its reexamination requests. Requester’s delay
                                       was the reason that the ‘093 and ‘094 reexaminations could very well be
                                       mooted before any reexamination decision issued and the USPTO Director found
                                       “good cause” to suspend the proceedings. On May 22, 2006, the U.S. District
                                       Court, Eastern District of Virginia, in <i>Sony
                                          Computer Entertainment America Inc. v. Dudas</i>, 85 USPQ2d 1594
                                       (E.D. Va 2006), issued a decision upholding the Office’s finding of “good
                                       cause” to suspend the ‘093 and ‘094 <i>inter
                                          partes</i> reexamination proceedings. Requester chose its route
                                       (litigation) and had to deal with the consequences of its decision, i.e., a
                                       suspension of the reexamination proceedings.
