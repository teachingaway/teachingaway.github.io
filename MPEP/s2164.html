                        meaningful way. The information contained in the disclosure of an application must be

                        necessarily mean that the limitation is also not enabled. In other words, even if a new

                        could make and use the claimed invention with the new limitation. Consequently, such
                        limitations must be analyzed for both enablement and description using their separate and
                        distinct criteria.

                        claimed subject matter is only presented in the claims and not in the specification portion
                        of the application, the specification should be objected to for lacking the requisite

                        enablement issues should be treated separately.

                        <p id="d0e215272">Any analysis of whether a particular claim is supported by
                           the disclosure in an application requires a determination of whether that disclosure,
                           when filed, contained sufficient information regarding the subject matter of the claims
                           as to enable one skilled in the pertinent art to make and use the claimed invention.&nbsp;The
                           standard for determining whether the specification meets the enablement requirement was
                           cast in the Supreme Court decision of <i>Mineral Separation v.
                              Hyde,</i> 242 U.S. 261, 270 (1916) which postured the question: is the
                           experimentation needed to practice the invention undue or unreasonable? That standard is
                           still the one to be applied. <i>In re Wands,</i> 858 F.2d
                           731, 737, 8 USPQ2d 1400, 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Accordingly, even though the statute
                           does not use the term “undue experimentation,” it has been interpreted to require that
                           the claimed invention be enabled so that any person skilled in the art can make and use
                           the invention without undue experimentation. <i>In re
                              Wands,</i> 858 F.2d at 737, 8 USPQ2d at 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1988). See also

                           reasonably skilled in the art could make or use the invention from the disclosures in
                           the patent coupled with information known in the art without undue experimentation.”). A
                           patent need not teach, and preferably omits, what is well known in the art. <i>In re Buchner,</i> 929&nbsp;F.2d 660, 661, 18 USPQ2d 1331, 1332

                           the specification can support an enabling disclosure, even a background section that
                           discusses, or even disparages, the subject matter disclosed therein. <i>Callicrate v. Wadsworth Mfg., Inc.,</i> 427 F.3d 1361, 77

                           findings. <i>In re</i><i>Vaeck,</i> 947 F.2d 488, 495, 20 USPQ2d 1438, 1444 (Fed.

                           if an enablement rejection is appropriate, the first Office action on the merits should
                           present the best case with all the relevant reasons, issues, and evidence so that all
                           such rejections can be withdrawn if applicant provides appropriate convincing arguments
                           and/or evidence in rebuttal. Providing the best rejection in the first Office action
                           will also allow the second Office action to be made final should applicant fail to
                           provide appropriate convincing arguments and/or evidence. Citing new references and/or
                           expanding arguments in a second Office action could prevent that Office action from
                           being made final. The principles of compact prosecution also dictate that if an

                           render the claims enabled, the examiner should note such limitations to applicant as

                                 three novel individual strains of microorganisms that were related in such a way
                                 as to establish a new species of microorganism, a species being a broader
                                 classification than a strain. The three specific strains had been appropriately
                                 deposited. The issue focused on whether the specification enabled one skilled in

                                       Cir. 1999), the court held that claims in two patents directed to genetic
                                       antisense technology (which aims to control gene expression in a

                                       not commensurate in scope with the claims. Both specifications disclosed
                                       applying antisense technology in regulating three genes in <i><i>E.
                                             coli.</i></i> Despite the limited disclosures, the
                                       specifications asserted that the “[t]he practices of this invention are
                                       generally applicable with respect to any organism containing genetic
                                       material which is capable of being expressed … such as bacteria, yeast,
                                       and other cellular organisms.” The claims of the patents encompassed
                                       application of antisense methodology in a broad range of organisms.
                                       Ultimately, the court relied on the fact that (1) the amount of direction
                                       presented and the number of working examples provided in the
                                       specification were very narrow compared to the wide breadth of the claims
                                       at issue, (2) antisense gene technology was highly unpredictable, and (3)
                                       the amount of experimentation required to adapt the practice of creating
                                       antisense DNA from <i><i>E.
                                             coli</i></i> to other types of cells was quite high,
                                       especially in light of the record, which included notable examples of the
                                       inventor’s own failures to control the expression of other genes in
                                       <i><i>E. coli</i></i> and other types of cells. Thus, the teachings set forth in the

                                       1983 application disclosed a vaccine against the RNA tumor virus known as
                                       Prague Avian Sarcoma Virus, a member of the Rous Associated Virus family.
                                       Using functional language, Wright claimed a vaccine “comprising an
                                       immunologically effective amount” of a viral expression product. <i>Id.</i> at 1559, 27 USPQ2d at 1511. Rejected
                                       claims covered all RNA viruses as well as avian RNA viruses. The examiner
                                       provided a teaching that in 1988, a vaccine for another retrovirus (i.e.,
                                       HIV) remained an intractable problem. This evidence, along with evidence
                                       that the RNA viruses were a diverse and complicated genus, convinced the
                                       Federal Circuit that the invention was not enabled for either all
                                       retroviruses or even for avian retroviruses.

                                       protein expression in dicotyledonous plant cells was enabled, the claims
                                       covered any plant cell. The examiner provided evidence that even as late

                                       invention and presented working examples,&nbsp;that all of the methods needed
                                       to practice the invention were well known, and that there was a high
                                       level of skill in the art at the time the application was filed.
                                       Furthermore, the applicant carried out the entire procedure for making a
                                       monoclonal antibody against HBsAg three times and each time was
                                       successful in producing at least one antibody which fell within the scope
                                       of the claims.

                              often represented in a “block diagram” format, i.e., a group of hollow rectangles

                                 software components. In order to meet his or her burden of establishing a
                                 reasonable basis for questioning the adequacy of such disclosure, the examiner
                                 should initiate a factual analysis of the system by focusing on each of the
                                 individual block element components. More specifically, such an inquiry should
                                 focus on the diverse functions attributed to each block element as well as the

                                 routine experimentation would be required by one of ordinary skill in the art to
                                 implement such a component or components, then enablement of the component or

                                 complex assemblages which have widely differing characteristics and which must be
                                 precisely coordinated with other complex assemblages. Under such circumstances, a

                                 block diagram disclosure of a complex system that includes a microprocessor and
                                 other system components controlled by the microprocessor, a mere reference to a

                                 microprocessor would be properly programmed to (1) either perform any required
                                 calculations or (2) coordinate the other system components in the proper timed
                                 sequence to perform the functions disclosed and claimed. If a particular program
                                 is disclosed in such a system, the program should be carefully reviewed to ensure
                                 that its scope is commensurate with the scope of the functions attributed to such

                                 (2) more than routine experimentation would be required of one skilled in the art
                                 to generate such a program, the examiner clearly would have a reasonable basis for
                                 challenging the sufficiency of such a disclosure. The amount of experimentation
                                 that is considered routine will vary depending on the facts and circumstances of
                                 individual cases and should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. No exact
                                 numerical standard has been fixed by the courts, but the “amount of required
                                 experimentation must, however, be reasonable.” <i>White

                                 apparently found that the amount of experimentation involved was reasonable where
                                 a skilled programmer was able to write a general computer program, implementing an

                                 presented in such a detailed fashion that the individual program's steps were

                                 with a reference to a proprietary computer in which they might be run. The

                                 985, 991, 169 USPQ 723, 727 (CCPA 1971) and <i>In re

                                 personnel question the adequacy of computer system or computer programming
                                 disclosures, the reasons for finding the specification to be nonenabling should be
                                 supported by the record as a whole. In this regard, it is also&nbsp;essential for USPTO
                                 personnel to reasonably challenge evidence submitted by the applicant. For
                                 example, in <i>In re Naquin, supra,</i> an affiant’s
                                 statement that the average computer programmer was familiar with the subroutine
                                 necessary for performing the claimed process, was held to be a&nbsp;statement of fact
                                 as it was unchallenged by USPTO personnel. In other words, unless USPTO personnel
                                 present a reasonable basis for challenging the disclosure in view of the record as
                                 a whole, a <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5">35 U.S.C. 112(a)</a></b> or

                                 for recognizing an insufficiently disclosed application involving computer
                                 programs, an examining guideline to generally follow is to challenge the
                                 sufficiency of such disclosures which fail to include either the computer program
                                 itself or a reasonably detailed flowchart which delineates the sequence of
                                 operations the program must perform. In programming applications where the
                                 software disclosure only includes a flowchart, as the complexity of functions and
                                 the generality of the individual components of the flowchart increase, the basis
                                 for challenging the sufficiency of such a flowchart becomes more reasonable
                                 because the likelihood of more than routine experimentation being required to
                                 generate a working program from such a flowchart also increases.

                              <p id="d0e216407"> As stated earlier, once USPTO personnel have
                                 advanced a reasonable basis or presented evidence to question the adequacy of a
                                 computer system or computer programming disclosure, the applicant must show that
                                 his or her specification would enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and
                                 use the claimed invention without resorting to undue experimentation. In most
                                 cases, efforts to meet this burden involve submitting affidavits, referencing
                                 prior art patents or technical publications, presenting arguments of counsel, or
                                 combinations of these approaches.

                              <p id="d0e216414">In computer cases, affidavits must be critically
                                 analyzed. Affidavit practice at the outset usually involves analyzing the skill
                                 level and/or qualifications of the affiant, which should be of the person of
                                 ordinary skill in the art. When an affiant’s skill level is higher than that
                                 required by the person of ordinary skill in the art for a particular application,
                                 an examiner may challenge the affidavit as insufficient should the affiant not
                                 submit evidence demonstrating the amount of experimentation required by a person
                                 of ordinary skill in the art to implement the invention. An affiant having a skill
                                 level or qualifications above that of the person of ordinary skill in the art
                                 would require less experimentation to implement the claimed invention than that
                                 for the person of ordinary skill. Similarly, an affiant having a skill level or
                                 qualifications below that of the person of ordinary skill in the art would require
                                 more experimentation to implement the claimed invention than that for the person
                                 of ordinary skill in the art. In either situation, the standard of the person of
                                 ordinary skill in the art would not have been met.

                                 problems with a given affidavit, which relate to the sufficiency of disclosure
                                 issue, generally involve affiants submitting few facts to support their
                                 conclusions or opinions. Some affidavits may go so far as to present conclusions
                                 on the ultimate legal question of sufficiency. <i>In re
                                    Brandstadter, </i>484 F.2d 1395, 179&nbsp;USPQ 286 (CCPA 1973), illustrates
                                 the extent of the inquiry into the factual basis underlying an affiant’s
                                 conclusions or opinions. In <i>Brandstadter,</i> the
                                 invention concerned a stored program controller (computer) programmed to control
                                 the storing, retrieving, and forwarding of messages in a communications system.
                                 The disclosure consisted of broadly defined block diagrams of the structure of the
                                 invention and no flowcharts or program listings of the programs of the controller.
                                 The Court quoted extensively from the examiner’s Office actions and examiner’s
                                 answer in its opinion where it was apparent that the examiner consistently argued
                                 that the disclosure was merely a broad system diagram in the form of labeled block
                                 diagrams along with statements of a myriad of desired results. Various affidavits
                                 were presented in which the affiants stated that all or some of the system circuit
                                 elements in the block diagrams were either well-known in the art or “could be
                                 constructed” by the skilled design engineer, that the controller was “capable of
                                 being programmed” to perform the stated functions or results desired, and that the
                                 person having ordinary skill in the art “could design or construct or was able to
                                 program” the system. The Court did consider the affiants’ statements as being some
                                 evidence on the ultimate legal question of enablement but concluded that the
                                 statements failed in their purpose since they recited conclusions or opinions with
                                 few facts to support or buttress these conclusions. With reference to the lack of
                                 a disclosed computer program or even a flowchart of the program to control the
                                 message switching system, the record contained no evidence as to the number of
                                 programmers needed, the number of man-hours and the level of skill of the
                                 programmers to produce the program required to practice the
                                 invention.

                                 ultimate legal question of enablement. See <i>Hirschfield,
                                    </i>462 F. Supp. at 143, 200 USPQ at 281. Where an affidavit shows that an
                                 inventor described the problem to be solved to an affiant, which then enabled the
                                 affiant to generate a computer program to solve the problem, such an affidavit
                                 will fail to demonstrate that the application alone would have taught a person of
                                 ordinary skill in the art how to make and use the claimed invention. See <i>In re Brown, </i>477 F.2d at 951, 177 USPQ at 695.&nbsp;In
                                 <i>Brown,</i> the court indicated that it had not been factually
                                 established that the applicant had not conveyed to the affiant vital and
                                 additional information in their several meetings in addition to that set out in
                                 the application. For an affidavit to be relevant to the determination of
                                 enablement, it must be probative of the level of skill of the personal of ordinary
                                 skill in the art as of the time the applicant filed his application. See <i>In re Gunn, </i>537 F.2d 1123, 1128, 190 USPQ 402, 406
                                 (CCPA 1976). In that case, each of the affiants stated what was known at the time
                                 he executed the affidavit, and not what was known at the time the applicant filed

                                 art computer system is very pertinent to the issue of enablement. But in some
                                 cases, this approach may not be sufficient to meet the applicant’s burden. Merely
                                 citing excerpts from technical publications in an affidavit in order to satisfy
                                 the enablement requirement is not sufficient if it is not made clear that a person
                                 skilled in the art would know which, or what parts, of the cited circuits could be
                                 used to construct the claimed device or how they could be interconnected to act in
                                 combination to produce the required results. See <i>In re

                                 analysis would appear to be less critical where the circuits comprising
                                 applicant’s system are essentially standard components of an identified prior art
                                 computer system and a standard device attached thereto.

                                 to show the state of the art for purposes of enablement. However, these patents
                                 must have an issue date earlier than the effective filing date of the application

                                 indicated that patents issued after the filing date of the application under
                                 examination are not evidence of subject matter known to any person skilled in the
                                 art since their subject matter may have been known only to the patentees and the

                              <p id="d0e216463">Merely citing prior art patents to demonstrate that
                                 the challenged components are old may not be sufficient proof since, even if each

                                 combination manner. Therefore, the specification in effect must set forth the
                                 integration of the prior art; otherwise, it is likely that undue experimentation,
                                 or more than routine experimentation would be required to implement the claimed

                                 565, 182 USPQ 298, 301 (CCPA 1974). The court also noted that any cited patents
                                 which are used by the applicant to demonstrate that particular box diagram
                                 hardware or software components are old must be analyzed as to whether such
                                 patents are germane to the instant invention and as to whether such patents
                                 provide better detail of disclosure as to such components than an applicant’s own
                                 disclosure. Also, any patent or publication cited to provide evidence that a
                                 particular programming technique is well-known in the programming art does not
                                 demonstrate that one of&nbsp;ordinary skill in the art could make and use
                                 correspondingly disclosed programming techniques unless&nbsp;both programming
                                 techniques are of approximately the same degree of complexity. See <i>In re Knowlton, </i>500 F.2d 566, 572, 183 USPQ 33,

                              <p id="d0e216479">Arguments of counsel may be effective in establishing
                                 that an examiner has not properly met his&nbsp;or&nbsp;her burden or has otherwise erred in
                                 his or her position. However, it must be emphasized that arguments of counsel
                                 alone cannot take the place of evidence in the record once an examiner has
                                 advanced a reasonable basis for questioning the disclosure. See <i>In re Budnick, </i>537 F.2d at 538, 190&nbsp;USPQ at 424;
                                 <i>In re Schulze,</i> 346 F.2d 600, 145 USPQ 716

                                 USPQ 230 (CCPA 1964). For example, in a case where the record consisted
                                 substantially of arguments and opinions of applicant’s attorney, the court
                                 indicated that factual affidavits could have provided important evidence on the
                                 issue of enablement. See <i>In re Knowlton,</i> 500
                                 F.2d at 572, 183 USPQ at 37; <i>In re Wiseman,</i>

                                 evidence needed to support an asserted utility will vary depending on what is

                           claimed subject matter. The focus of the examination inquiry is whether everything
                           within the scope of the claim is enabled. Accordingly, the first analytical step
                           requires that the examiner determine exactly what subject matter is encompassed by the
                           claims. See, e.g., <i>AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac,</i> 344
                           F.3d 1234, 1244, 68 USPQ2d 1280, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (When a range is claimed, there
                           must be reasonable enablement of the scope of the range. Here, the claims at issue
                           encompassed amounts of silicon as high as 10% by weight, however the specification
                           included statements clearly and strongly warning that a silicon content above 0.5% by
                           weight in an aluminum coating causes coating problems. Such statements indicate that
                           higher amounts will not work in the claimed invention.). The examiner should determine
                           what each claim recites and what the subject matter is when the claim is considered
                           <span class="Underline">as a whole</span>, not when its parts are analyzed
                           individually. No claim should be overlooked. With respect to dependent claims,

                           “a claim in a dependent form shall be construed to incorporate by reference all the
                           limitations of the claim to which it refers” and requires the dependent claim to further

                        <p id="d0e216724">The Federal Circuit has repeatedly held that “the
                           specification must teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the full scope of
                           the claimed invention without ‘undue experimentation’.” <i>In re

                           Nevertheless, not everything necessary to practice the invention need be disclosed. In

                           is necessary is that one skilled in the art be able to practice the claimed invention,
                           given the level of knowledge and skill in the art. Further the scope of enablement must
                           only bear a “reasonable correlation” to the scope of the claims. See, e.g., <i>In re Fisher,</i> 427&nbsp;F.2d 833, 839, 166 USPQ 18, 24 (CCPA

                              Amgen has told how to make and use only a few of them and is therefore not entitled
                              to claim all of them.
