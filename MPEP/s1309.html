                        electronic capture of most of the information to be printed in a patent will begin as soon
                        as an allowed application is received in the Office of Patent Publication, immediately
                        after the Notice of Allowance has been mailed. The Office of Patent Publication forwards
                        the allowed applications to the printer for Initial Data Capture (IDC). This IDC process
                        takes approximately five weeks to accomplish and during this time the application, if in a
                        paper file, is <b id="d0e134413">not</b> available to examiners or for purposes of
                        making copies of the application (copies of the application files that have been published
                        may be ordered from the Office of Public Records, upon payment of the fee, but the
                        applications will not be removed from the publication process for purposes of making
                        copies). After IDC is completed, the application is returned to the Office of Patent
                        Publication, and the file will be available to examiners and the Office of Public Records. 
                     </p>

                        other requirements have been met (e.g., drawings) within the time allowed by law, the
                        application is forwarded to the printer for Final Data Capture (FDC) and final issue
                        preparation. At this point, the application can only be retrieved if it is withdrawn from
                        issue. The application is assigned a patent number and issue date about ten days before the
                        application issues as a patent, and an Issue Notification is mailed to inform the applicant
                        of the patent number and issue date. A bond paper copy of the patent grant is ribboned,
                        sealed, and mailed by the Office of Patent Publication.

                           The assignee entry on form PTOL-85B should still be completed to indicate the assignment
