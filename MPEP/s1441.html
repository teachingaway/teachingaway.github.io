                        reissue application and submit pertinent information to the Office before the examiner’s
                        action. The pertinent information is submitted in the form of a protest under

                        <b><a href="s1901.html#d0e194315">MPEP §
                              1901.04</a></b>, the public should be aware that such submissions should
                        be made as&nbsp;early as possible, because under certain circumstances, the 2-month delay period
                        will not be employed. For example, the Office may act on a continuation or a divisional
                        reissue application before the expiration of the 2-month period after announcement.
                        Additionally, the Office will entertain a petition under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324988">37 CFR
                              1.182</a></b> which is accompanied by the required petition fee

                        2 months. Accordingly, protestors to reissue applications (see <b><a href="s1441.html#d0e140541">MPEP §
                              1441.01</a></b>) cannot automatically assume that a full 2-month delay
                        period will always be available. Appropriate reasons for requesting that the 2-month delay
                        period not be employed include that litigation involving a patent has been stayed to permit
                        the filing of an application for the reissue of the patent. Where the basis for the
                        petition is ongoing litigation, the petition must clearly identify the litigation, and
                        detail the specifics of the litigation that call for prompt action on the reissue
                        application before the expiration of the 2-month delay period. Such petitions are decided
                        by the Office of Patent Legal Administration.
