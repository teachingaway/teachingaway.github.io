                           in reexamination often becomes important, and sometimes critical, in coordinating the

                        </h2>
                        <p id="d0e235726">If a Federal Court decision <i>on the merits</i> of a patent is known to the examiner at the
                           time the determination on the request for <i>ex parte</i>
                           reexamination is made, the following guidelines will be followed by the examiner,
                           whether or not the person who filed the request was a party to the litigation. When the
                           initial question as to whether the prior art raises a substantial new question of
                           patentability as to a patent claim is under consideration, the existence of a final
                           court decision of claim <i>validity</i> in view of the same
                           or different prior art does not necessarily mean that no new question is present. This
                           is true because of the different standards of proof and claim interpretation employed by
                           the District Courts and the Office. See for example <i>In re
                              Zletz</i>, 893 F.2d 319, 322, 13&nbsp;USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (manner of
                           claim interpretation that is used by courts in litigation is not the manner of claim
                           interpretation that is applicable during prosecution of a pending application before the
                           PTO) and <i>In re Etter</i>, 756 F.2d 852, 225&nbsp;USPQ 1 (Fed.
                           Cir. 1985) (the <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305845">35 U.S.C. 282</a></b> presumption of patent
                           validity has no application in reexamination proceedings). Thus, while the Office may
                           accord deference to factual findings made by the court, the determination of whether a
                           substantial new question of patentability exists will be made independently of the
                           court’s decision on validity as it is not controlling on the Office. See <i>In re
                              Swanson et al</i>, 540 F.3d 1368, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2008), where the Federal
                           Circuit approved of the Office’s interpretation in <b><a href="s2242.html#d0e225368">MPEP § 2242</a></b>. A
                           <i>non-final</i> holding of claim <i>invalidity</i> or unenforceability will not be controlling on
                           the question of whether a substantial new question of patentability is present. A final
                           holding of claim invalidity or unenforceability (after all appeals), however, is
                           controlling on the Office. In such cases, a substantial new question of patentability
                           would <i>not</i> be present as to the claims held invalid
                           or unenforceable. See <i>Ethicon v.</i><i>Quigg</i>, 849 F.2d 1422, 7&nbsp;USPQ2d 1152 (Fed. Cir.

                              Texas</i>, the patent being reexamined was subject to an infringement suit, in
                           which the district court had issued its claim construction ruling (in a district court
                           opinion) as to the definition of a term. The parties ultimately reached a settlement
                           before trial, and the district court issued an “Order of Dismissal with Prejudice.” The
                           patent owner relied on that district court claim construction ruling in a reexamination
                           proceeding, and argued that the Office was bound by that district court claim
                           construction ruling, under the doctrine of issue preclusion. The Federal Circuit stated
                           that issue preclusion could not be applied against the Office based on a district court
                           holding in an infringement proceeding, since the Office was not a party to that earlier
                           infringement proceeding.

                        <p id="d0e235778">In <i>Translogic</i>, a district court infringement suit proceeded in parallel with
                           a reexamination proceeding. The district court upheld the validity of the patent in the
                           infringement suit, while the reexamination examiner found the claim combination to be
                           obvious . The examiner’s rejection was affirmed by the Board. The defendant (the alleged
                           infringer) of the infringement suit appealed the district court decision to the Federal
                           Circuit, while the patent owner appealed the Board’s decision to the Federal Circuit.
                           The Federal Circuit consolidated the appeals, and then addressed only the patent owner’s
                           reexamination appeal from the Board. The Federal Circuit affirmed the examiner’s
                           conclusion of obviousness by relying upon and providing an extensive discussion of

                              prior art reference applied in the same manner</i> in the subsequent

                        <p id="d0e235840">The issuance of a <i>final</i> Federal Court decision upholding validity during an

                           effect on the examination of the reexamination. This is because the court states in
                           <i>Ethicon v.</i><i>Quigg</i>, 849 F.2d 1422, 1428, 7 USPQ2d 1152, 1157
                           (Fed. Cir. 1988) that the Office is <i>not</i> bound by a
                           court’s holding of patent <i>validity</i> and should
                           continue the reexamination. The court notes that district courts and the Office use
                           different standards of proof in determining invalidity, and thus, on the same evidence,
                           could quite correctly come to different conclusions. Specifically, invalidity in a
                           district court must be shown by “clear and convincing” evidence, whereas in the Office,
                           it is sufficient to show nonpatentability by a “preponderance of evidence.” Since the
                           “clear and convincing” standard is harder to satisfy than the “preponderance” standard,
                           deference will ordinarily be accorded to the factual findings of the court where the
                           evidence before the Office and the court is the same. If sufficient reasons are present,
                           claims held valid by the court may be rejected in reexamination.
                        </p>
                        <p id="d0e235861">On the other hand, a <i>final</i> Federal Court holding of invalidity or
                           unenforceability (after all appeals), is binding on the Office. Upon the issuance of a
                           final holding of invalidity or unenforceability, the claims being examined which are
                           held invalid or unenforceable will be withdrawn from consideration in the reexamination.
                           The reexamination will continue as to any remaining claims being examined. Thus, the
                           reexamination will continue if any original, new, or amended claim being examined that
                           was not found invalid or unenforceable by the Court. If <span class="Underline">all</span> of the <span class="Underline">claims <span class="Underline">being examined</span> in the reexamination
