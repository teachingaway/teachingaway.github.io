                           key to the U.S. Patent Classification System (USPC). The complete Manual of
                           Classification is available to USPTO personnel from the Classification Home Page
                           (http://ptoweb:8081/), which is accessible from the desktop via the Patent Examiner’s
                           Toolkit. The Manual of Classification is also available via the Internet at <span class="Underline">http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification</span>. The
                           information in the Manual is updated every 2 months. In addition, the Manual of
                           Classification is archived every June and December in portable document format (PDF) on
                           CD-ROM.

                        <p id="d0e113656">There are over 400 classes in the
                           USPC. Each class has a title descriptive of its subject matter, is identified by a class
                           number, and is subdivided into a number of subclasses. Each subclass also has a
                           descriptive title, is identified by a subclass number, and the subclass number is an
                           integral number that may contain a decimal portion and/or alpha characters. A complete
                           identification of a subclass requires both the class and subclass number and any alpha
                           or decimal designations; e.g., 417/161.1A identifies Class 417, Subclass
                           161.1A.

                           contains ordered arrangements of all class and subclass titles, the ordered arrangements
                           are referred to as class schedules. The class and subclass titles are brief and are as
                           suggestive as possible of the subject matter included. Therefore, it is best not to
                           depend exclusively upon titles to explain the subject matter encompassed by a class and
                           subclass but to refer also to the respective definitions and notes. If a search is to be
                           expeditious, accurate, and complete, the Manual of Classification should be used only as
                           a key to the class or subclass definition and appended notes.

                              related disclosures located in other classes or subclasses.

                              They generally state the relationship to, and&nbsp;difference from, other identified
                              subject matter collections. Each “See or Search” note helps a user reach a decision
                              either to include or exclude an area containing relevant subject

                              since a search note that applies to a particular subclass is rarely repeated for
                              subclasses indented thereunder, it is advisable to review the search notes of all

                           <p id="d0e114119">The Reclassification Alert Report
                              is updated quarterly and is available online to USPTO personnel from the
                              Classification Home Page under the heading Classification Reports. The Classification
                              Home Page (http://ptoweb:8081/) is accessible from the desktop via the Patent
                              Examiner’s Toolkit. The report numerically lists the classes and subclasses affected
                              by classification orders which issued during the quarter, indicating if the
                              classifications were established, were abolished, or had definition
                              changes.
