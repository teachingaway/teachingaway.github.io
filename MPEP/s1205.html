                                          <b><a href="mpep-0010-title-page.html#">41.52</a></b>, any arguments or
                                          authorities not included in the appeal brief will be refused
                                          consideration by the Board for purposes of the present appeal. Each
                                          ground of rejection contested by appellant must be argued under a
                                          separate heading, and each heading shall reasonably identify the
                                          ground of rejection being contested (<i>e.g.</i>, by
                                          claim number, statutory basis, and applied reference, if any). For
                                          each ground of rejection applying to two or more claims, the claims
                                          may be argued separately (claims are considered by appellant as
                                          separately patentable), as a group (all claims subject to the
                                          ground of rejection stand or fall together), or as a subgroup (a
                                          subset of the claims subject to the ground of rejection stand or
                                          fall together). When multiple claims subject to the same ground of
                                          rejection are argued as a group or subgroup by appellant, the Board
                                          may select a single claim from the group or subgroup and may decide
                                          the appeal as to the ground of rejection with respect to the group
                                          or subgroup on the basis of the selected claim alone.
                                          Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the failure
                                          of appellant to separately argue claims which appellant has grouped
                                          together shall constitute a waiver of any argument that the Board
                                          must consider the patentability of any grouped claim separately.
                                          Under each heading identifying the ground of rejection being
                                          contested, any claim(s) argued separately or as a subgroup shall be
                                          argued under a separate subheading that identifies the claim(s) by
                                          number. A statement which merely points out what a claim recites
                                          will not be considered an argument for separate patentability of
                                          the claim.

                           month would be required. Similarly, if the appellant files a request for continued

                           argued under a separate heading, which clearly identifies the ground of rejection being
                           contested. For each ground of rejection applying to two or more claims, the claims may
                           be argued separately (claims are considered by appellants as separately patentable), as
                           a group (all claims subject to the ground of rejection stand or fall together), or as a
                           subgroup (a subset of the claims subject to the ground of rejection stand or fall
                           together). When multiple claims subject to the same ground of rejection are argued as a
                           group or subgroup by appellant, the Board may select a single claim from the group of
                           claims and may decide the appeal as to the ground of rejection with respect to the group
                           or subgroup of claims as to the ground of rejection on the basis of the selected claim
                           alone. The failure of appellant to separately argue claims which appellant has grouped
                           together constitutes a waiver of any argument that the Board must consider the
                           patentability of any grouped claim separately. See <i>In re
                              McDaniel</i>, 293 F.3d 1379, 1384, 63 USPQ2d 1462, 1465-66 (Fed. Cir. 2002).
                           Under each heading identifying the ground of rejection being contested, any claim(s)
                           argued separately or as a subgroup shall be placed under a separate subheading that
                           identifies the claim(s) by number.

                        <p id="d0e123550">For example, if Claims 1 to 5 stand

                           anticipated by U.S. Patent No. Y and appellant is arguing only the limitations of
                           independent claim 1, and thereby grouping dependent claims 2 to 5 to stand or fall with
                           independent claim 1, then one possible heading as required by this subsection could be
                           “<span class="Underline">Rejection under 35&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;102(b) over U.S. Patent No. Y</span>” and
                           an optional subheading would be “<span class="Underline">Claims 1 to 5</span>.” Another example
                           is where claims 1 to 3 stand rejected under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302395">pre-AIA 35&nbsp;U.S.C. 102(b)</a></b> as being
                           anticipated by U.S. Patent No. Z and appellant wishes to argue separately the
                           patentability of each claim, a possible heading as required by this subsection could be
                           “<span class="Underline">Rejection under 35&nbsp;U.S.C. 102 (b) over U.S. Patent No. Z</span>,”
                           and the required subheadings would be “<span class="Underline">Claim 1</span>,”
                           “<span class="Underline">Claim 2”</span> and “<span class="Underline">Claim 3</span>.” Under each
                           subheading the appellant would present the argument for patentability of that claim.
                           Another example is where claims 1-10 stand rejected under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as
                           being anticipated over U.S. Patent No. X and appellant wishes to argue claims 1-3 as a
                           first subgroup, claim 4 separately, and claims 5-10 as another subgroup. A possible
                           heading as required by this subsection could be “Rejection under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) over
                           U.S. Patent No. X,” and the required subheadings would be “Claims 1-3,” “Claim 4,” and
                           “Claims 5-10.” To make certain that an argument for separate consideration of a claim or
                           subgroup of claims is not overlooked by the examiner or by the Board, the rule requires
                           appellant to use a subheading for each claim for which separate consideration by the
                           Board is desired.
