                                          nonprovisional application will not result in either the refund of
                                          any fee properly paid in the provisional application or the
                                          application of any such fee to the filing fee, or any other fee,
                                          for the nonprovisional application. Conversion of a provisional

                                          will result in the term of any patent to issue from the application
                                          being measured from at least the filing date of the provisional
                                          application for which conversion is requested. Thus, applicants
                                          should consider avoiding this adverse patent term impact by filing
                                          a nonprovisional application claiming the benefit of the

                              Agreements Act (effective as of June 8, 1995), is the establishment of a domestic
                              priority system. The Act provides a mechanism to enable domestic applicants to
                              quickly and inexpensively file provisional applications. Under the provisions of 35
                              U.S.C. 119(e), applicants are entitled to claim the benefit of priority in a given
                              application in the United States. The domestic priority period will not count in the
                              measurement of the 20-year patent term. See 35 U.S.C. 154(a)(3). Thus, domestic
                              applicants are placed on equal footing with foreign applicants with respect to the
                              patent term.

                              entitle applicant to a refund of the fees which were properly paid in the application
                              filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b). See MPEP § 601.01(c). 35 U.S.C. 111(b)(5) permits a
                              provisional application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(c) to be converted to a
                              nonprovisional application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b). A request to convert a
                              provisional application to a nonprovisional application must be accompanied by the
                              fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(i) and an amendment including at least one claim as
                              prescribed by 35 U.S.C. 112, unless the provisional application otherwise contains at
                              least one such claim. The request must be filed prior to the earliest of the
                              abandonment of the provisional application or the expiration of twelve months after
                              the filing date of the provisional application. The filing fee for a nonprovisional
                              application, the inventor’s oath or declaration under 37 CFR 1.63, and the surcharge
                              under 37 CFR 1.16(f), if appropriate, are also required. The grant of any such
                              request will not entitle applicant to a refund of the fees which were properly paid
                              in the application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(c). Conversion of a provisional
                              application to a nonprovisional application will result in the term of any patent
                              issuing from the application being measured from at least the filing date of the
                              provisional application. This adverse patent term impact can be avoided by filing a
                              nonprovisional application claiming the benefit of the provisional application under
                              35 U.S.C. 119(e), rather than requesting conversion of the provisional application to
                              a nonprovisional application. See 37 CFR 1.53(c)(3).

                                 amendment will generally not be reflected in the patent application publication

                                 specification and drawings do not contain any subject matter that would have been
                                 new matter in the prior application. Thus, the new specification and corrected

                                 desired set of claims, rather than the set of claims in the prior application, it
                                 is strongly recommended that the continuation or divisional application be filed

                                 drawing(s) is (are) inadvertently omitted from an application. For applications
                                 filed on or after September 21, 2004, applicants are encouraged to provide an
                                 explicit incorporation by reference statement to the prior-filed application(s)
                                 for which benefit is claimed under 35 U.S.C. 120 if applicants do not wish the
                                 incorporation by reference to be limited to inadvertently omitted material
                                 pursuant to 37 CFR 1.57(a). See 37 CFR 1.57(b) and MPEP § 608.01(p) for discussion
                                 regarding explicit incorporation by reference.

                                 added after an application’s filing date is not effective because no new matter
                                 can be added to an application after its filing date (see 35 U.S.C. 132(a)). If an
                                 incorporation by reference statement is included in an amendment to the
                                 specification to add a benefit claim under 35 U.S.C. 120 after the filing date of
                                 the application, the amendment would not be proper. When a benefit claim under 35
                                 U.S.C. 120 is submitted after the filing of an application, the reference to the

                                 determine whether the continuation or divisional application, as originally filed,
                                 includes a statement incorporating by reference the prior application(s). For
                                 applications filed prior to September 21, 2004, the statement could appear in the
                                 application transmittal letter (or the specification, rather than only in the
                                 specification). The inclusion of this incorporation by reference of the prior
                                 application(s) was necessary in these applications to permit applicant to amend
                                 the continuation or divisional application to include subject matter in the prior
                                 application(s) without the need for a petition. See also the subsection above
                                 regarding “Incorporation by Reference.” If the continuation or divisional
                                 application filed prior to September 21, 2004 under 37 CFR 1.53(b) does not
                                 include the incorporation by reference statement in the application papers (in the
                                 specification or in the transmittal letter) as originally filed and applicant has
                                 not been informed of the omitted items, the application should be returned to OPAP
                                 for mailing of a “Notice of Omitted Item(s).” For applications filed on or after
                                 September 21, 2004, see 37 CFR 1.57(a) and <b><a href="s217.html#ch200_d1ff72_27f9d_2c9">MPEP § 217</a></b>

                                 invention after the prosecution of a utility or plant application is closed should
                                 consider filing a request for continued examination (RCE) under 37 CFR 1.114. For
                                 more information on RCE practice, see MPEP § 706.07(h). Applicants who wish to

                                 an application under 37 CFR 1.53(b). See MPEP § 201.06(c). CPAs filed prior to

                                 forth in prior 37 CFR 1.53(d). Any request for a CPA filed on or after July 14,

                                    when a continuing application is filed, applicant would need to file a petition
                                    under 37 CFR 1.137 to revive the prior application to establish copendency with
                                    the continuing application under 37 CFR 1.53(b).

                                    CFR 1.53(b), a continuation or divisional (but not a continuation-in-part)
                                    application may be filed under 37 CFR 1.53(d) if the prior application is a
                                    design application that is complete as defined by 37 CFR 1.51(b). A
                                    continuation or divisional application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(d) is called a
                                    “Continued Prosecution Application” or “CPA.” A CPA has a number of advantages
                                    compared to a continuation or divisional application filed under 37 CFR
                                    1.53(b). For example, the papers required to be filed in the U.S. Patent and
                                    Trademark Office in order to secure a filing date under 37 CFR 1.53(d) are
                                    minimal compared to 37 CFR 1.53(b). In addition, the Office will not normally
                                    issue a new filing receipt for a CPA. See 37 CFR 1.54(b). The time delay
                                    between the filing date and the first Office action should be less for a CPA
                                    than for an application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b). For examination priority
                                    purposes only, the USPTO will treat continuation CPAs as if they were “amended”
                                    applications (as of the CPA filing date) and not as “new” applications. This
                                    treatment is limited to CPAs in which the prior application has an Office
                                    action issued by the examiner. If no Office action has been issued in the prior
                                    application, the CPA will be treated, for examination purposes, like a “new”
                                    application unless a petition to make special under 37 CFR 1.102 or a request
                                    for expedited examination under 37 CFR 1.155 is filed in the CPA. As “amended”
                                    applications generally have a shorter time frame for being acted on by
                                    examiners than “new” applications, the treatment of a CPA as an “amended”
                                    application will result in a first Office action being mailed in the CPA much
                                    sooner than if it had been filed as a continuation application under 37 CFR
                                    1.53(b) (or under former 37 CFR 1.60 or 1.62). Therefore, applicants are
                                    strongly encouraged to file any preliminary amendment in a CPA at the time the
                                    CPA is filed. See 37 CFR 1.115 and MPEP § 714.03(a).

                                 <p id="ch200_d1ff70_275e0_1c7">A request for a CPA expressly
                                    abandons the prior application as of the filing date of the request for the
                                    CPA. See 37 CFR 1.53(d)(2)(v). Therefore, where the prior application is not to
                                    be abandoned, any continuation or divisional application must be filed under 37
                                    CFR 1.53(b). If applicant wants the USPTO to disregard a previously filed
                                    request for a CPA filed in a design application (and not recognize its inherent
                                    request to expressly abandon the prior application) and to treat the paper as
                                    the filing of an application under 37 CFR 1.53(b), the applicant must file a
                                    petition under 37 CFR 1.182. A request to expressly abandon an application is
                                    not effective until the abandonment is acknowledged, including the express
                                    abandonment of the prior application of a CPA that occurs by operation of 37
                                    CFR 1.53(d)(2)(v). The express abandonment of the prior application is
                                    acknowledged and becomes effective upon processing and entry of the CPA into
                                    the file of the prior application. Thus, such a petition under 37 CFR 1.182
                                    should be filed expeditiously since the petition will not be granted once the
                                    request for a CPA has been entered into the prior application (and the inherent
                                    request to expressly abandon the prior application has been acknowledged). If
                                    the request for a CPA has been entered into the prior application by the time
                                    the petition under 37 CFR 1.182 and the application file are before the
                                    deciding official for a decision on the petition, the petition will be denied.
                                    It is noted, however, that if the applicant intended to file a second
                                    application (either a continuation or a divisional) without abandoning the
                                    prior application, applicant can still achieve that result without loss of the
                                    benefit of the original filing date by: (A) continuing the prosecution of the
                                    original application via the CPA; and (B) filing a new continuation/divisional
                                    under 37 CFR 1.53(b) claiming benefit of the CPA and its parent applications
                                    under 35 U.S.C. 120 during the pendency of the CPA.

                                    will be assigned the same application number as the prior nonprovisional

                                    when filing the CPA must be made in the form of an amendment to the prior
                                    application as it existed prior to filing the CPA, see 37 CFR 1.53(d)(5). Any
                                    new specification filed with the CPA request will not be considered part of the

                                    in accordance with 37 CFR 1.125. However, the applicant must comply with the
                                    requirements of 37 CFR 1.125(b) before the substitute specification will be
                                    entered into the CPA. Since 37 CFR 1.125(b) requires that a substitute
                                    specification be accompanied by, inter alia, a statement that the substitute
                                    specification includes no new matter, any substitute specification containing
                                    new matter will be denied entry by the examiner. Any preliminary amendment to
                                    the written description and claims, other than a substitute specification,
                                    filed with a CPA request will ordinarily be entered. Any new matter which is
                                    entered, however, will be required to be canceled pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 132
                                    from the descriptive portion of the specification. Further, any claim(s) which
                                    relies upon such new matter for support will be rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112,
                                    first paragraph. See MPEP § 2163.06. In the event that a substitute
                                    specification or preliminary amendment containing new matter was filed with a
                                    request for a CPA, applicant may file a petition under 37 CFR 1.182 requesting
                                    that the substitute specification or preliminary amendment be removed from the
                                    CPA application file, and be accorded the status as a separate application by
                                    being placed in a new file wrapper and assigned a new application number, with
                                    the new application being accorded a filing date as of the date the request for
                                    a CPA and substitute specification/preliminary amendment were filed. Of course,
                                    a request for a CPA is not improper simply because the request is accompanied
                                    by a substitute specification or preliminary amendment containing new matter.
                                    Thus, an applicant will not be entitled to a refund of the filing fee paid in a
                                    proper CPA as a result of the granting of a petition under 37 CFR 1.182

                                    is a signed oath or declaration. Since a CPA cannot contain new matter, the

                                    invention, and attorney’s docket number of the prior application. If the TC is
                                    unable to identify the application number of the prior application and the

                                    may be requested by telephone to supply a letter signed by the practitioner
                                    providing the correct application number. If all attempts to obtain the correct

                                    returned by the TC to the sender where a return address is available. The

                                    Patent and Trademark Office with the correct application number within two
                                    weeks of the mail date on the cover letter, the original date of receipt of the
                                    CPA request will be considered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as the
                                    date of receipt of the CPA request. See 37 CFR 1.5(a). A copy of the returned
                                    CPA request and a copy of the date-stamped cover letter should be retained by
                                    the TC. Applicants may use either the Certificate of Mailing or Transmission
                                    procedure under 37 CFR 1.8 or the “Express Mail” procedure under 37 CFR 1.10

                                    of the date of deposit in the United States Postal Service. If the returned CPA
                                    request is not resubmitted within the two-week period with the correct
                                    application number, the TC should cancel the original “Office Date” stamp on
                                    the CPA request and re-stamp the returned CPA request with the date of receipt
                                    of the resubmission or with the date of deposit as “Express Mail” with the
                                    United States Postal Service, if the CPA request is resubmitted under 37 CFR
                                    1.10. Where the CPA request is resubmitted later than two weeks after the
                                    return mailing by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the later date of
                                    receipt or date of deposit as “Express Mail” of the resubmission will be
                                    considered to be the filing date of the CPA request. The two-week period to

                                    strictly a reply to an Office action mailed in a prior application, a request
                                    for a CPA is a paper directed to and placed in the file of the prior
                                    application, and seeks to take action in (i.e., expressly abandon) the prior

                                    1.136(a)(3). As a result, an authorization in the prior application to charge
                                    all required fees, fees under 37 CFR 1.17, or all required extension of time
                                    fees to a deposit account or to a credit card (See MPEP § 509) will be treated

                                    fee to be charged in the prior application would be the extension fee necessary
