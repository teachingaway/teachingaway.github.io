                        When filing a reissue application electronically, an applicant should choose the “reissue”
                        radio button. Regardless of the manner of filing, all new reissue filings should include a
                        copy of a completed Reissue Patent Application Transmittal Form (PTO/AIA/50) to ensure that
                        the filing of the new application will be recognized as a reissue
