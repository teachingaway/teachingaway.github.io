                        Conclusion of <i>Ex Parte</i> Reexamination Proceeding  [R-11.2013]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e235995">Upon conclusion of the <i>ex parte</i> reexamination proceeding, the examiner must prepare
                        a “Notice of Intent to Issue <i>Ex Parte</i> Reexamination
                        Certificate” (NIRC) by completing form PTOL-469. If appropriate, an examiner’s amendment
                        will also be prepared. Where claims are found patentable, reasons must be given for each
                        claim found patentable. See&nbsp;the discussion as to preparation of an examiner’s amendment and
                        reasons for allowance at the end of this section. In addition, the&nbsp;examiner must prepare
                        the reexamination file so&nbsp;that the Office of Data Management can prepare and&nbsp;issue a
                        certificate in accordance with <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e306581">35 U.S.C. 307</a></b> and <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e330878">37 CFR
                              1.570</a></b> setting forth the results of the reexamination proceeding and
                        the content of the patent following the proceeding. See <b><a href="s2288.html#d0e236777">MPEP §

                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e236015">The examiner will so inform his/her
                        Central Reexamination Unit (CRU) Supervisory Patent Reexamination Specialist (SPRS) or
                        Technology Center (TC) Quality Assurance Specialist (QAS) of the conclusion of the
                        reexamination proceeding. The CRU SPRS/TC QAS will convene a panel review conference (see
                        <b><a href="s2271.html#d0e233154">MPEP
                              §2271.01</a></b>), and the conference members will review the
                        patentability of the claim(s). If the conference confirms the examiner’s decision, a NIRC
                        shall be issued and signed by the examiner, with the two, or more, other conferees
                        initialing the NIRC (as “conferee”) to indicate their participation in the conference. All
                        conferees will initial, even though one of them may have dissented from the conference
                        decision on the patentability of the claim(s). If the conference does not confirm the
                        patentability of the claim(s), the examiner will reevaluate and issue an appropriate Office
                        action rejecting the claim(s), not confirmed as patentable.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e236030">A panel review conference is not to be
                        held as to any claim that was in the case (proceeding) at the time the case was reviewed by
                        the Board or a federal court. The following example will serve to illustrate this point. In
                        a reexamination proceeding, claims 5-10 are allowed by the examiner, and claims 1-4 are
                        rejected. The rejection of claims 1-4 is then appealed to the Board. The Board reverses the
                        rejection of claims 1-4 and imposes a new ground of rejection of claims 1-4 under
                        <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356980">37
                              CFR 41.50(b)</a></b>. The patent owner then elects further prosecution before
                        the examiner pursuant to <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e356980">37 CFR 41.50(b)(1)</a></b> and submits an
                        amended set of claims 1-4. The examiner finds amended claims 1-4 to be allowable and wishes
                        to “allow” the entire case by issuing a NIRC. A panel review conference must be held at
                        this stage of the proceeding. The conferees will review the allowance of amended claims
                        1-4. The conferees will not, however, review the allowance of claims 5-10, because claims
                        5-10 were in the case, and before the Board at the time the Board decided the
                        appeal.

                     <p id="d0e236039">A panel review conference is not to be
                        held where the proceeding is to be concluded by the cancellation of all claims. No panel
                        review conference is needed in this instance, as the issuance of the NIRC is essentially
                        ministerial.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e236042">Thus, a panel review conference <b id="d0e236044">must</b> be held in each instance where a NIRC is about to be
                        issued, unless the NIRC is being issued: (A) following and consistent with a decision by
                        the Board (or court) on the merits of the proceeding; or (B) as a consequence of the patent
                        owner’s failure to respond or take other action where such a response or action is
                        necessary to maintain pendency of the proceeding and, as a result of which failure to
                        respond, all of the claims will be canceled. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e236048">A NIRC informs the patent owner and any
                        third party requester that the reexamination prosecution has been terminated. The rules do
                        not provide for an amendment to be filed in a reexamination proceeding after prosecution
                        has been terminated. <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e326304">The provisions of 37 CFR 1.312</a></b> do
                        <i>not</i> apply in reexamination. Any amendment,

                        proceeding filed after prosecution has been terminated must be accompanied by a petition

                     <p id="d0e236060">Normally the title of the invention
                        will not need to be changed during reexamination. If a change of the title
                        <i>is</i> necessary, the patent owner should be notified of the need to
                        provide an amendment changing the title as early as possible in the prosecution as a part
                        of an Office action. If all of the claims are found to be patentable and a NIRC has been or
                        is to be mailed, the examiner may change to the title of the invention only by an
                        examiner’s amendment. Changing the title and merely initialing the change is <i>not</i> permitted in reexamination.

                        of the reexamination have changed the focus of the invention. An example of this would be
                        where a claim is made more specific during reexamination, and the abstract does not at all
                        focus on the specific limitation that is now required for all the patent
                        claims.
