                                 to the reference’s or activity’s date. The test is whether the species completed

                              known, whereas under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#aia_d0e323512">37 CFR 1.131(a)</a></b> practice, proof
                              of a utility must be shown only if the reference discloses a utility. <i>In re Wilkinson,</i> 304 F.2d 673, 134&nbsp;USPQ 171 (CCPA 1962);

                              1971). Where proof of utility is required, whether or not test results are required
                              to establish the utility of the subject matter in question depends on the facts of
                              each case. The ultimate issue is whether the evidence is such that one of ordinary
                              skill in the art would be satisfied to a reasonable certainty that the subject matter
                              necessary to antedate the reference possessed the alleged utility. <i>In re Blake,</i> 358 F.2d 750, 149 USPQ 217 (CCPA 1966).

                              either diligent at a given time or he is not diligent; there are no degrees of
                              diligence. An applicant may be diligent within the meaning of the patent law when he
                              or she is doing nothing, if his or her lack of activity is excused. Note, however,
                              that the record must set forth an explanation or excuse for the inactivity; the USPTO
                              or courts will not speculate on possible explanations for delay or inactivity. See
                              <i>In re Nelson,</i>, 420 F.2d 1079, 164 USPQ 458
                              (CCPA 1970). Diligence must be judged on the basis of the particular facts in each
                              case. See <b><a href="s2138.html#d0e207967">MPEP § 2138.06</a></b> for a detailed
                              discussion of the diligence requirement for proving prior invention.
