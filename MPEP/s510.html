                           employees and contractors), should be requested. If the individual refuses, notify a

                           of the posted regulations, should prepare a memorandum detailing the facts of the

                           via their TC Director. Supervisory Patent Examiners and TC Directors are authorized to
                           demand surrender of a User or Visitor badge on-the-spot. If the Supervisory Patent
                           Examiner exercises this function, the TC Director should be immediately notified,
