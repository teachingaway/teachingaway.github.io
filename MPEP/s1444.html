                              supplemental oath/declaration will be needed to identify at least one error now being
                              relied upon as the basis for reissue, even if a prior oath/declaration was earlier
                              found proper by the examiner. The supplemental oath/declaration is not required to
                              indicate that the error(s) identified in the prior oath(s)/declaration(s) is/are no
                              longer being corrected. In this instance, applicant’s submission of the supplemental
                              reissue oath/declaration to obviate the rejection under 35 U.S.C. 251 may, at
                              applicant’s option, be deferred until the application is otherwise in condition for
                              allowance. The submission can be deferred because a proper statement of error was
                              provided in the initial reissue oath/declaration, and therefore applicant does not
                              need to supply a supplemental reissue oath/declaration each time the error being
                              corrected is changed. Applicant need only conspicuously and clearly identify the new
                              error in the remarks section of the reply and request that submission of the
                              supplemental reissue oath/declaration be deferred until allowance. Such a request
                              will be considered a complete reply to the rejection.
