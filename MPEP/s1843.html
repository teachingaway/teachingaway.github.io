                        			that for all international applications having an international filing date on or after
                        			January 1, 2004, and subject to PCT Rule <b><a href="mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e375172">69.1</a></b> (b- <i>bis</i> ), the International Searching Authority establishes
                        			a written opinion of the International Searching Authority at the same time it
                        			establishes either the international search report or the declaration of
                        			non-establishment of the international search report under PCT Article <b><a href="mpep-9025-appx-t.html#d0e363501">17</a></b> (2)(a). (For applications having an international filing date
                        			prior to January 1, 2004, the International Searching Authority establishes an
                        			international search report but does not establish a written opinion.) The written
                        			opinion indicates whether the claimed invention appears to be novel, to involve an
                        			inventive step (to be non-obvious), and to be industrially applicable. The written
                        			opinion also indicates any defects in the form or content of the international
                        			application under the PCT Articles or Regulations. In addition, the written opinion
                        			includes any observations that the International Searching Authority wishes to make on
                        			the clarity of the claims, the description, and the drawings, or on the question of
                        			whether the claims are fully supported by the description.

                           				of written disclosure. Information disclosed on the Internet or an on-line database
                           				is considered to be publicly available as of the date the disclosure was publicly

                           				it were published in time, giving the date the document was printed out as its

                           				are fulfilled, such as sufficient support of the claims by the description and
                           				industrial applicability. The examiner should also note any documents that may be of
                           				importance for other reasons, such as documents putting doubt upon the validity of
                           				any priority claimed, documents contributing to a better or more correct
                           				understanding of the claimed invention, and documents illustrating the technological
                           				background, but the examiner should not spend time in searching for these documents,
                           				nor the consideration of such matters unless there is a special reason for doing so
                           				in a particular case. Documents which do not qualify as prior art because they
                           				post-date the claimed invention may nevertheless be cited to show a universal fact,
                           				such as characteristics or properties of a material, or a specific scientific fact,
                           				or to show the level of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, examiners must
                           				recognize that different designated Offices may have different definitions of what
                           				is the effective date of prior art. Accordingly, when performing the search,
                           				examiners should be mindful to pick out and select for citation, where appropriate,
                           				prior art which may be relevant in offices other than the one in which they are
                           				situated. However, the examiner need not expand the search beyond the standard
                           				search parameters to discover such art. Where the search has been performed and such
                           				potentially relevant prior art has been identified, examiners are encouraged to, for
                           				example, cite all relevant art published prior to the international filing date even
                           				if that art and the international application under consideration have common
                           				applicants and/or inventors. As such, if the examiner is basing the international
                           				search on a prior search performed in a prior related U.S. national application, it
                           				may be necessary for the examiner to review the prior art published within the time
                           				period of the one year preceding the filing date of the prior U.S. application for
                           				any written disclosures based on the applicant’s own work that may have been
                           				published within that time period. Any such documents are considered prior art in an
                           				international application and are cited on the international search report even
                           				though they do not meet the definition of prior art in the prior U.S. national
                           				application. A further objective of the international search is to avoid, or at
                           				least minimize, additional searching at the national stage.

                              					it may be necessary to make use of the Internet as a search tool. Where the
                              					international application has not yet been published at the time of the search,
                              					there exists the danger that search terms used in the search on non-secure
                              					Internet search engines or in databases available on the Internet may be
                              					observed by third parties. Accordingly, all web sites must be treated as
                              					non-secure unless the Office has a commercial arrangement with a service
                              					provider in order to maintain confidentiality and a secure connection to that
                              					web site. Consequently, extreme caution must be exercised when using the
                              					Internet as a search tool where (as in most cases) the international application
                              					has not yet been published. Where a relevant database is accessible via the
                              					Internet, but an alternative secure connection to the same database is
                              					accessible, the secure connection must be used. Where no secure connection to a
                              					database on the Internet is available, the search may be conducted on the
                              					Internet using generalized search terms representing combinations of features
                              					that relate to the claimed invention, which have already been shown to exist in
                              					the state of the art.
