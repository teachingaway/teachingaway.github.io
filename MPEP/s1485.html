                     <p id="d0e146802">Requests for Certificates of Correction
                        will be forwarded to the Certificate of Correction Branch of the Office of Data Management,
                        where they will be listed in a permanent record book.

                     <p id="d0e146805">If the patent is involved in an
                        interference under 37 CFR part 41, subpart D, a Certificate of Correction under
                        <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e326665">37
                              CFR 1.324</a></b> will not be issued unless a corresponding motion under
                        <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e358396">37 CFR
                              41.121(a)(2)</a></b> or <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e358402">41.121(a)(3)</a></b> has been granted by the
                        administrative patent judge. If the patent is involved in a contested case under 37 CFR
                        part 42, subpart D, a Certificate of Correction under 37 CFR 1.324 will not be issued
                        unless a corresponding motion under 37 CFR 42.22 has been granted by the administrative
                        patent judge. Otherwise, determination as to whether an error has been made, the
                        responsibility for the error, if any, and whether the error is of such a nature as to
                        justify the issuance of a Certificate of Correction will be made by the Certificate of
                        Correction Branch. If a report is necessary in making such determination, the case will be
                        forwarded to the appropriate group with a request that the report be furnished. If no
                        certificate is to issue, the party making the request is so notified and the request,
                        report, if any, and copy of the communication to the person making the request are entered
                        into the file history by the Certificate of Correction Branch. If a certificate is to
                        issue, it will be prepared and forwarded to the person making the request by the Office of
                        Data Management. In that case, the request, the report, if any, and a copy of the letter
                        transmitting the Certificate of Correction to the person making the request will be entered
                        into the file history.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e146817">Applicants, or their attorneys or
                        agents, are urged to submit the text of the correction on a special Certificate of
                        Correction form, PTO/SB/44 (also referred to as Form PTO-1050), which can serve as the
                        camera copy for use in direct offset printing of the Certificate of Correction. 
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e146820">Where only a part of a request can be
                        approved, or where the Office discovers and includes additional corrections, the
                        appropriate alterations are made on the form PTO/SB/44 by the Office. The patentee is
                        notified of the changes on the Notification of Approval-in-part form PTOL-404. The
                        certificate is issued approximately 6 weeks thereafter.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e146823">Form PTO/SB/44 should be used
                        exclusively regardless of the length or complexity of the subject matter. Intricate
                        chemical formulas or page of specification or drawings may be reproduced and mounted on a
                        blank copy of PTO/SB/44. Failure to use the form has frequently delayed issuance because
                        the text&nbsp;must be retyped by the Office onto a PTO/SB/44.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e146831">The exact page and line number where
                        the errors occur in the application file should be identified on the request. However, on
                        form PTO/SB/44, only the column and line number in the printed patent should be
                        used.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e146834">The patent grant should be retained by
                        the patentee. The Office does not attach the Certificate of Correction to patentee’s copy
                        of the patent. The patent grant will be returned to the patentee if
                        submitted.
