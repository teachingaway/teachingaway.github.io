                        publication fee was previously paid. If an application becomes abandoned without being
                        allowed, no publication fee is required. The small entity discount is not available for the
                        publication fee. The sum specified in the Notice of Allowance and Fee(s) Due will also
                        include the publication fee which must be paid within three months from the date of mailing
                        of the Notice of Allowance and Fee(s) Due to avoid abandonment of the application. This

                        been published at the time when the publication fee is due. The Office will continue with
                        the pre-grant publication process until a patent actually issues. This is because there are
                        many instances in which the Office mails a notice of allowance in an application but the
                        application does not issue as a patent in regular course. Therefore, the Office will not
                        discontinue the pre-grant publication process until a patent has actually issued. Since the
                        Office cannot discontinue the pre-grant publication process during the last two to four
                        weeks of the publication process, this will result in a few applications being issued as
                        patents and subsequently being published as patent application publications. The Office
                        will refund the publication fee (if paid) if the application is not published as a patent
                        application publication, but will not refund the publication fee if the application is
                        published as a patent application publication, even if it is published after the patent
                        issues. Effective January 1, 2014, the publication fee set forth in <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e315959">37 CFR 1.18(d)</a></b> is
                        $0.00.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e120912">Accordingly, applicant may file a
                        request for a refund of the publication fee after 4 weeks from the issue date of the patent
                        if the application did not publish. A request for refund filed before 4 weeks from the
                        issue date is premature and will be disregarded. Requests for a refund of the publication
                        fee should be directed to the Office of Data Management – Patent Publication Branch at Mail
