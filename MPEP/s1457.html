                           assigned an application number. The design reissue application file is then forwarded to
                           the Office of Patent Legal Administration (OPLA) for a decision under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324988">37 CFR

                           the design reissue application filing is published in the <i>Official Gazette</i> (see <b><a href="s1441.html#d0e140493">MPEP § 1441</a></b>). Once the

                           reissue application file will be returned to the Design TC Director’s Office. In
                           accordance with the waiver, the Design Group will begin expedited examination of the

                           return of the design reissue application file from OPLA, rather than delay examination
                           until after 2 months from the date the announcement is published in the <i>Official Gazette</i> and the applicant will be notified that
                           examination is being expedited. The decision under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e324988">37 CFR 1.182</a></b> will
                           require that no Notice of Allowance be mailed in the design reissue application until
                           after 2 months from the date the announcement is published in the <i>Official Gazette</i>. For example, if the design reissue
                           application is allowed on the first Office action, then jurisdiction over the reissue
                           application will be retained in the TC, and the Notice of Allowance will not be mailed
                           until the expiration of 2 months after publication of the filing of the design reissue

                           matching any protest filed with the application). The examiner will check the PALM
                           contents to ascertain when publication actually occurred. The delay in the mailing of

                           There is no error in the design patent. Also, converting a design patent to a utility
                           patent will, in most instances, involve the introduction of new matter into the patent.
                           The disclosure of a design patent is not directed to how the invention is made and used,
                           and the introduction of new matter is required to bridge this gap and provide support
                           for the utility patent. Accordingly, the examiner should consider rejections based on
                           the introduction of new matter under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C. 251</a></b> and
                           lack of enablement and/or description under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302824">35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, when
                           a reissue application is filed to convert a design patent to a utility patent. 
                        </p>

                           may not be extended by reissue. <i>Ex parte Lawrence</i>,
                           70 USPQ 326 (Comm’r Pat. 1946). Thus, any reissue application filed to convert a design
                           patent to a utility patent, which conversion would thereby extend the term of the
                           patent, should be rejected as failing to comply with <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C. 251</a></b>,
                           which permits reissue only 
                           "for the unexpired part
                           of the term of the original patent."
                           
                           
                            The statute requires that
                           the reissued patent shall not extend the term of the original patent.

                                 U.S.C. 251</a></b> requires that the “patent is, through error , deemed
                           wholly or partly inoperative or invalid, by reason of a defective specification or
                           drawing, or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than he had a right to claim
                           in the patent”; however, the utility patent is not wholly or partly inoperative or
                           invalid. There is no error in the utility patent. It is also noted that conversion of a
                           design patent would exempt the existing utility patent from maintenance fees, and there
                           is no statutory basis for exempting an existing patent from maintenance fees. Finally,
                           <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e305345">35 U.S.C. 251</a></b> provides that “the
                           Director shall…reissue the patent…for the unexpired part of the term of the original
                           patent”; a conversion from utility patent to a design patent via reissue would
                           impermissibly provide a mechanism for circumventing the 14-year statutory term of a
                           design patent, in cases where the unexpired term of the original utility patent is more
                           than 14 years.
