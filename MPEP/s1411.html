                        the patent can be simply copied without cutting). Applicants are required to submit a clean
                        copy of each drawing sheet of the printed patent at the time the reissue application is

                           and disclaimer of claim(s) under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e326459">37 CFR 1.321(a)</a></b> should be made
                           without using underlining or brackets. Because these are retroactively a part of the
                           original patent and are made before the reissue application will issue as a patent, they
                           must show up in the printed reissue patent document as part of the original patent,
                           i.e., not in italics or bracketed. If the changes are submitted improperly with
                           underlining and brackets, the examiner will require correction by the applicant in the
                           form of a replacement paragraph (or paragraphs) without such markings. If the changes
                           are extensive, a clean copy of the specification with the Certificate of Correction
                           changes in it may be required by the examiner after consulting with his/her supervisor.
                           For the clean copy of the specification to be entered as a substitute specification, the
                           reissue applicant must file a grantable petition under <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e325004">37 CFR
                                 1.183</a></b> for waiver of <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e323301">37 CFR 1.125(d)</a></b> and

                                 1.173(a)(1)</a></b>. The examiner’s requirement for the clean copy will
                           generally serve as sufficient basis for granting the petition.
