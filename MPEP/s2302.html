                        Consult an Interference Practice Specialist  [R-08.2012]
                     </h1>
                     <p id="d0e238172">Every Technology Center (TC) has at
                        least one Interference Practice Specialist (IPS), who must be consulted when suggesting an
                        interference to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (Board).
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e238175">Less than one percent of all
                        applications become involved in an interference. Consequently, examiners are not expected
                        to become experts in interference practices. Instead, examiners are expected to be
                        proficient in identifying potential interference and to consult with an IPS in their TC on
                        interference matters. The IPS, in turn, is knowledgeable about when and how to suggest
                        interferences, how to handle inquiries to and from the Board before and during
                        interferences, and how to handle applications after interferences are
                        completed.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e238178">An IPS must approve any referral of a
                        suggested interference to the Board. The referral must include a completed Form PTO-850,
                        which either an IPS or a Director of the examiner’s TC must sign.
                     </p>
                     <p id="d0e238181">IPSs consult with administrative patent
                        judges (APJs) that declare interferences to stay current in interference practice. When
                        necessary, an IPS may arrange for a consultation with an APJ to discuss a suggested
                        interference or the effect of a completed interference. Examiners must promptly address
                        inquiries or requests from an IPS regarding a suggested interference.

                              or any other interference issue arises during prosecution of an application, the
                              examiner should bring the matter to the attention of an IPS in the examiner’s TC.

                              rejected claims thereby leaving only allowable claims which interfere with the claims

                              may be suggested, provided the applicant with the later filing date makes the showing
                              required by <b><a href="mpep-9020-appx-r.html#d0e359547">37 CFR 41.202(d)</a></b>. Note that if
                              the earliest filed application is available as a reference (for example, as a
                              published application under <b><a href="mpep-9015-appx-l.html#d0e302383">35 U.S.C. 102(e)</a></b>) against the
                              other application, then a rejection should be made against the other application.
                              Ideally, the rejection would be made early in the prosecution, but if it is not and
                              as a result the junior application is not in condition for allowance, then the senior
                              application should be issued. In light of patent term adjustments it is no longer
                              appropriate to suspend an application on the chance that an interference might
                              ultimately result.
