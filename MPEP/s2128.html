                              accessible to the public. The nature of the index was not determinative. The
                              disesenting&nbsp;judge relied on prior Board decisions <i>(Gulliksen v. Halberg, </i>75 USPQ 252, 257 (Bd. App. 1937) and <i>Ex parte Hershberger,</i> 96 USPQ 54, 56 (Bd. App. 1952)),
                              which held that shelving a single copy in a public library makes the work a “printed
                              publication.” While these Board decisions have not been expressly overruled, they
                              have been criticized in other decisions. See&nbsp;<i>In re
