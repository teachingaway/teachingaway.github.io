## Lawyer Office Hours in Dumbo Brooklyn

Come talk startup and technology law in an informal setting. Ask about anything from raising money, to contract fine print, to trademarks and patent trolls. 

* Can I copyright a Tweetstorm? 
* How many stock options for a full-stack innovation sherpa? 
* Can I shred this demand letter? 
* Does my Doge Coin platform need a money-transmitter license? 

We'll try to answer. In any event, we're off the clock.
