While anyone is welcome at office hours, we have limited bandwidth for new client engagements. Our startup practice tends to be a good fit for (a) companies showing real traction or revenue, (b) experienced technical founders, (c) startups with a serious seed or series A term sheet, (d) technology or media companies with 10-75 employees. 

If you think our firm might be a good fit for your business, email me: eric at adlervermillion.
