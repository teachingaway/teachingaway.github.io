Come chat about startup and technology law. Sign up for a free 30 minute slot to talk about topics from raising money, to contracts, to trademarks and patent trolls. 

- What's a "provisional patent"? Is it important before a beta launch? 
- What's the difference between ® and ™ after a brand? 
- How does a liquidation preference work? 
- When is a convertible note a good idea? 
- <a href="/employee-inventions/">when does a company own its employee's inventions?</a>

These sessions have quickly become the highlight of our week. We learn a lot, and sometimes even provide useful information.
