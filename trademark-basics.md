Trademark protect brand identity. They reduce the risk of [namespace collision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_collision). A trademark can be any name, image or slogan used to identify a company. 

## Trademarks:  <em>Brand Protection</em>

Our attorneys understand modern identity development, trademark registration and enforcement. We understand the fluid nature of branding for the internet, and we guide clients toward unique and defensible brand identities.

## Selecting a Name

Trademarks should be unique and non-descriptive. A trademark is "descriptive" if it describes the product its used on. This leads to a weaker trademark, because descriptive words are generally saved for the public domain. When you've settled on a handful of strong potential trademarks, do a "clearance search" to see if anyone else is using the proposed trademark on a similar product. 

**Unique:** Pick a name that no one else is using. First, just google your proposed name. Is anyone else using it on a similar product? Next, search the [US Registered Trademark Database](tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=login&p_lang=english&p_d=trmk).  then search some international trademark databases, and finally. 

The US Trademark Database is pretty old. Here's a useful search string: 



    “foo-mark”[BI] AND “some products”[GS] AND live[LD]



* “foo-mark”[BI] - asks for a search of the "Basic Index" -- this is essentially the index of trademark names.  
* AND - put it in capitals. 
* “some products”[GS] - this asks for a search of a particular type of product. 
* live[LD] - asks for only live trademark registrations and applications (will not clutter up your search results with abandoned registrations). 

Putting that together with an example: 

    “Snackattack”[BI] AND “cupcakes”[GS] AND live[LD]

will search for any registered trademarks for the word "snackattack" as used on the product "cupcakes."

 
**Non-Descriptive:** Pick a name that does *not* directly describe your product. A good trademark is either a made-up word (like Xerox), or a word thats entirely unrelated to your product (like how *Apple* is entirely unrelated to computer). 

## Trademark Symbols: ™ and ®

Use the ™ symbol after an *unregistered* trademark. Use the ® symbol after a *registered* trademark. 

The purposes of these trademark symbols is to tell your customers and competitors that you are claiming trademark rights in your brand name (or logo or slogan).
