Trademark protect brand identity. They reduce the risk of [namespace collision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_collision). A trademark can be any name, image or slogan used to identify a company.

## Costs for US and International Trademark Registrations

Since the US procedure differs from the International procedure, I'll discuss them separately below. 

 
### Flat Fee for US Trademark Applications 

We generally bill a $2,000 flat fee for trademark registrations. This includes a preliminary "knockout" search of the US Trademark Office database, preparation and filing of the US Trademark application, and the application fee for the first "class" of goods. 

This flat fee also includes replies to quick Office Actions (i.e., problems that can be solved with a 5 minute phone call to the Trademark Office). However, responding to longer Office Actions is billed hourly. 

Most of our trademark applications are approved and registered without any additional fees. 

### International Trademark Applications

The "Madrid Protocol" provides a fairly efficient mechanism for international trademark registrations. There are three main steps. First, we file a single international trademark application in the US Trademark Office. This application includes a list of foreign countries where we are looking for trademark protection, as well as a fee for each country. Second, The US Trademark Office forwards the application to the International Bureau (“IB”) of the World Intellectual Property Organization for review.  Third, if approved, the IB forwards the application to the trademark offices of every country listed in the original application. The process takes about 18 months from application to registration. 

**Cost.** The cost varies, but generally comes to around $3,000 in legal fees, plus filings fees (which vary by country). For example, the fee for filing in the EU, China, Japan and Mexico is about $3,000 (making the total fee around $6,000). 

**Local Counsel.** If an international application is rejected by a foreign trademark office, the response needs to be filed by a local trademark lawyer from that foreign country. This can add significant cost. 

**Trademark Office Fees.** There are fees at each stage. The International Bureau charges a $650 fee; and each country’s trademark office charges a fee of around $300. 


| Country | Cost | Notes |
|:--------|:-------|:--------|
| International App   | 650   | For three classes |
| EU   | 1,100   | For three classes |
| China | 250   | For one class|
| Korea | 225   |    |
| Japan | 600   |    |
| Mexico | 225   |    |
| Australia |  407  |    |
| Canada |  N/A  |    |
| Brazil |  N/A  |    |

*International fees are paid in Swiss Francs, but exchange rate to USD is about 1:1.

## Selecting a Name

Trademarks should be unique and non-descriptive. A trademark is "descriptive" if it describes the product its used on. This leads to a weaker trademark, because descriptive words are generally saved for the public domain. When you've settled on a handful of strong potential trademarks, do a "clearance search" to see if anyone else is using the proposed trademark on a similar product. 

**Unique:** Pick a name that no one else is using. First, just google your proposed name. Is anyone else using it on a similar product? Next, search the [US Registered Trademark Database](tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=login&p_lang=english&p_d=trmk).  then search some international trademark databases, and finally. 

The US Trademark Database is pretty old. Here's a useful search string: 



    “foo-mark”[BI] AND “some products”[GS] AND live[LD]



* “foo-mark”[BI] - asks for a search of the "Basic Index" -- this is essentially the index of trademark names.  
* AND - put it in capitals. 
* “some products”[GS] - this searches for strings in the "goods and services" database. Try searching for some common words that describe your products or service. 
* live[LD] - asks for only live trademark registrations and applications (otherwise, your search results will be cluttered with abandoned registrations). 

Putting that together with an example: 

    “Snackattack”[BI] AND “cupcakes”[GS] AND live[LD]

This search string will look for any registered trademarks for the word "snackattack" as used on the product "cupcakes."

 
**Non-Descriptive:** Pick a name that does *not* directly describe your product. A good trademark is either a made-up word (like Xerox), or a word thats entirely unrelated to your product (like how the word "Apple" is entirely unrelated to computers or software). 

## Trademark Symbols: ™ and ®

Use the ™ symbol after an *unregistered* trademark. Use the ® symbol after a *registered* trademark. 

The purposes of these trademark symbols is to tell your customers and competitors that you are claiming trademark rights in your brand name (or logo or slogan).
