We litigate IP disputes, secure patents, and counsel clients on trademark, copyright, and technology licensing issues.

## Patents:  <em>Defending Research & Development</em>

Our patent practice combines rigorous data analytics with deep patent law experience.

A carefully structured portfolio can generate licensing deals, venture capital, and be a powerful tool for disposing with baseless lawsuits.

## Trademarks:  <em>Brand Protection</em>

From identity development, to trademark registration and enforcement, our attorneys work side-by-side with clients to maximize brand value. We understand the fluid nature of branding for the internet, and we help direct  direct clients toward unique and easily defensible identities.

## Copyright:  <em>Defending Creative Works</em>

Copyright law helps creative professionals and software developers protect their art and code. We write <a href="http://www.copyrightcodex.com/">Copyright Codex</a>, a free treatise on copyright law that has been recognized by law schools like Standford and Duke. 
        
## IP Litigation

We litigate complex contract and intellectual property disputes. We defend technology companies from patent trolls. We also help enforce legitimate IP rights, even against larger, better-funded competitors. We contain litigation costs through efficient discovery technology. 

We have successfully handled disputes including trade secret claims, winning trademark appeals at the USPTO, and contract and copyright disputes in federal court.

## The [MPEP](../MPEP/index.html) in Jekyll. 
The Manual of Patent Examination Procedure guides US patent examiners in approving and rejecting patents. Its a huge book. A Jekyll-based website is a convient way to read it. 
Some important sections are [Obviousness](../MPEP/s2141.html), [written description](../MPEP/s2163.html), and [patentable subject matter](../MPEP/s2106.html).
